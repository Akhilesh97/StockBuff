The SoftBank-backed company has promoted Peter Sirota, a former executive at Amazon.com Inc.’s Web Services business who joined Mapbox three years ago, to the top job. He replaces Eric Gundersen, who has been with the company since its start in 2010 and now becomes chief strategy officer and chairman of the board.

The San Francisco-based startup is taking on Alphabet Inc.’s Google Maps as it tries to establish itself as the center of car navigation systems. Mapbox inked a deal with BMW Group for in-car navigation last year. It’s looking to unveil deals with a half-dozen additional carmakers this year, said a person familiar with the plans.

Sirota will also need to eventually return the company to break-even. Earlier in its lifespan, Mapbox turned a modest profit by focusing on nonprofits and governments. The levels of investment required for the auto and logistics industries took Mapbox into the red in recent years. Still, the company has raised about $150 million from SoftBank and is valued at more than $1 billion, said the person familiar with the business who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Revenue is on track to exceed $100 million this year, the person said.

A main competitor of Mapbox, as Sirota sees it, is the smartphone. About 700 million people interact with a Mapbox service each month, he said. Google Maps has more than 1 billion monthly users.

Mapbox can be better than a smartphone app by using information from a car’s sensors, Sirota said. For example, if a vehicle is running out of fuel, it can highlight the location of nearby gas stations. For electric cars, it can incorporate range data and plan routes based on the location of charging stations.

One of Sirota’s goals is to establish the car as the main input for directions before people form a lasting habit of pulling up Google or Apple maps on their phones. “Now is a very important moment,” Sirota said. “This opportunity has a window in it, so we have to get there fast.”

Seoul-based Coupang and some existing shareholders are offering 120 million shares at $27 to $30 each, according to a filing Monday. At the top end of the range, Coupang will be valued at as much as $51 billion based on the number of shares outstanding.

Founded in 2010 by Chief Executive Officer Bom Kim, Coupang has grown faster than the e-commerce market amid fierce competition from retail conglomerates and startups. It has also aggressively expanded its delivery and logistics businesses.

A successful IPO would be another windfall for billionaire Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp. The Japanese conglomerate invested $1 billion in Coupang in 2015 and its Vision Fund put in another $2 billion in 2018, pushing its valuation to about $9 billion. The SoftBank Vision Fund will own about 37% of the company’s Class A shares after the offering, according to Monday’s filing.

The listing would be the fourth-biggest on record by an Asian company on a U.S. exchange and the largest since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $25 billion IPO in 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It also comes in what is expected to be a record year for Korean listings.

Coupang is offering 100 million new Class A shares in the IPO, and 20 million shares are being offloaded by existing investors. Each Class A share is entitled to one vote, while the Class B shares held by Coupang’s founder are entitled to 29 votes. Kim will hold about 76.7% of the voting power at Coupang upon completion of the listing.

Kim, a Harvard University dropout, has been considering an IPO for years, but had held off until now so he could focus on expanding the business. Coupang, known as “Korea’s Amazon,” has invested in new business models including food delivery and streaming services.

BlackRock Inc. and Greenoaks Capital are also among Coupang’s investors. The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPNG.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Allen & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Group AG, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and CLSA are working on the offering. Bank of America Corp., which was listed as one of the underwriters in a February registration document, didn’t appear in Monday’s filing.

7,2021-03-01T15:38:03+00:00,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: CVS Health, Walgreen Boots, Herbalife, Rite Aid and Amazon","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – March 1, 2021 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Retail - Pharmacy, including CVS Health Corporation CVS, Walgreen Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. HLF, Rite Aid Corporation RAD and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1270031/3-pharmacies-drugstore-stocks-to-watch-amid-covid-19-resurgence

In the initial pandemic months, the retail pharmacy and drug store industry registered higher sales as a result of panic buying of all kinds of immunity-boosting drugs. However, in these months limited international trade rattled the global supply chain of all drug types.

Also, sales of other major drugs and anti-infectives fell significantly, curtailing profit margins of the industry players. The situation improved in the second half of 2020 with the gradual opening of the global economy. Although the resurgence of infections and the emergence of new virus strains has again led to some restrictions, the industry players are generating huge business while actively taking part in the process of vaccine rollout.

Mail order pharmacies are registering growth on account of telehealth and remote monitoring services. However, small and medium pharma retailers find it hard to invest in online pharmacies. However, this has created unique opportunities for heavyweights within the industry like CVS Health and Walgreen Boots, which invested strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications during this period.

The current frontrunner in the industry is Herbalife.

About the Industry

The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry essentially includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. This is distinctively different from the concept of hospital pharmacy wherein drugs are usually sold strictly under the prescription of hospital doctors.

The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Their pharmacies dispense millions of prescription medications each year.  Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications.

Story continues

The Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry is known for heavy consolidations. Going by a small business chronicle report, Walgreens Boots, CVS Health and Rite Aid are commonly referred to as the ""big three"" in the drugstore space. However, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway, which are on the brink of floating major healthcare ventures, by and large affected the business of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores players.

4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry

Industry Trend Remains Mixed Amid the Pandemic: Brand name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic slump. Drug retailers are also suffering from a significant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials of drugs.

At the same time, a number of retail pharmacy players are taking a pivotal role in administering COVID -19 shots. The center has recently launched the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination, which is a collaboration between the federal government, states and territories and 21 national pharmacy partners and independent pharmacy networks to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines across the United States. Walgreens, CVS Health, Rite Aid, Kroger are some of the participants.

For the next few quarters, unless the vaccination process gets properly completed, this latest line of opportunity is expected to contribute significantly to these industry players’ top line.

Online Pharmacy and Mail Order Boom: The widespread shelter-in-place regulations since the beginning of the pandemic have created a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacy from traditional brick and mortar pharmacies. However, experts say that this transition is expected to last even after the pandemic is over.

Data claims that COVID-19 has only accelerated the already-growing demand for e-pharmacy and mail-ordered home delivery systems. Going by a Patch report, “Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal.”

With e-commerce giant Amazon’s big move into the healthcare space, the retail pharmacy industry entered a new phase of fierce competition. To counter this rivalry, the companies operating in the space are strategically attempting to gain in size and scale, both organically and inorganically.

Prescription Drug Inflation Continues: In the pre-COVID-19 period too, this industry was entangled in the issue of continuous rise in drug cost. Going by a January 2020 Fortune report, more than 3,400 prescription drugs’ prices were hiked in the first six months of 2019, reflecting a 17% increase from the year-earlier tally.

This, in turn, led patients to replace prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs. The trend largely hurt the business of the likes of Walgreens Boots and Rite Aid through 2019. Meanwhile, 3 Axis Advisors predicts that in 2020, nearly 500 prescription drugs will be costlier as drugmakers proceed with price increases averaging 5% (published in in-pharmatechnologist article).

Emphasis on Chronic Disease Care: The modern pharmacy retail and drugstore concept stresses on chronic disease care and management. Irrespective of age group, millions of Americans are at present suffering from chronic conditions that require lifestyle modifications and daily maintenance medications. These include Type I and Type II diabetes, heart diseases and dementia, such as Alzheimer’s.

Per current data, a very small percentage of the population takes medication as prescribed and tries to bring positive changes in their lifestyle, thus exerting additional pressure on the healthcare system. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), three in four aging Americans have multiple chronic conditions, clearly indicating the hugely untapped market for pharmacy retailers dealing with chronic condition management. Keeping this in mind, CVS Health acquired Aetna.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong Near-Term Prospects

The industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, placing it in the top 25% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of optimistic earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Industry Outperforms S&P 500 & Sector

The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has outperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past three months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 9.7% over this period while the Retail-Wholesale Sector has moved down 1.2%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has increased 8.5% over the said time frame.

Industry’s Current Valuation

One might derive a fair idea of the industry’s relative valuation from its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which is commonly used for valuing retail pharmacy and drug store companies.

The industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 9.42, close to its five-year low of 7.42. We also see that the industry is trading lower than the broader industry’s forward P/E ratio of 30.38.

Comparing the industry with the S&P 500 Index on the basis of the forward P/E ratio, we see that the industry is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 22.71.

3 Stocks Likely to Keep Moving Higher

Herbalife: This nutrition products company’s percentage of U.S. business is growing through distributors who operate a Nutrition Club model, which represents the majority of its volume in the country. Amid the pandemic, the company witnessed growth in average number of unique customers. Recently, the company launched its segmentation initiative in nine markets in EMEA.

CVS Health: CVS Health’s specialty digital solutions for patients witnessed a 25% CAGR over the past two years, and since the start of the pandemic the company has been seeing a significant part of its specialty orders being placed digitally. In this period, CVS Health’s consumer centric digital strategy has become even more relevant as people are using technology more while they stay at home.

This trend began in January and accelerated with COVID-19.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings indicates year-over-year increase of 7.5%. CVS Health, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has risen 16.8% in the past year.

Rite Aid Corporation: Rite Aid has been providing home service delivery to customers with an eligible prescription, with the benefit of zero delivery fees. Moreover, it launched Buy Online Pickup In Store initiative in a bid to offer better drive through and curbside pickup options.

Apart from this, the surge in demand for Tele Health in the wake of COVID-19 has led the company to accelerate the launch of Rite Aid Virtual Care. As part of its corporate strategy and growth plan, Rite Aid is currently focused on strengthening its foothold in mid-market PBM, innovation across its retail and mail-order pharmacy channels. In this line, the company revamped more than 700 stores and is likely to complete the rest in 2021.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings indicates year-over-year increase of 326.7%. Rite Aid, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has gained 55% in the past year.

8,2021-03-01T14:43:03+00:00,"IBM Expands Hybrid Cloud Service, Targeting Banks, Health Care","(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. has publicly released its hybrid cloud service, furthering its plan to pivot the business toward the fast-growing market for storing large amounts of data on the internet.

The expanded offering, called IBM Cloud Satellite, allows customers to control how they store their information, with some of it held internally in what’s known as private cloud, and other data stored in public clouds such as Amazon.com Inc’s AWS, or Microsoft Corp’s Azure. As a latecomer to cloud services, IBM is targeting highly-regulated industries such as banking and health care, which have been slow to adopt internet-based storage solutions due to security concerns and scale.

For these industries, the integration of public and private clouds has been “too complex, too expensive, and a huge amount of risk,” said Howard Boville, head of hybrid cloud at IBM. To accommodate such clients, Cloud Satellite is designed to streamline cybersecurity, and make regulatory compliance “invisible,” Boville said.

IBM sees the evolution as a crucial step in Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna’s vision to transform the century-old company into a modern enterprise focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. IBM has collaborated with 65 companies, including Dell, Intel Corp., and Cisco Systems Inc., to help customers run workloads and to provide input on Cloud Satellite’s development.

Lumen Technologies, previously known as CenturyLink, will be a Cloud Satellite partner, and deploy the service at 180,000 enterprise locations. The ability to offer the Cloud Satellite service to companies where the data now lives, will help offer reassurance to businesses whose data is highly sensitive and who have been hesitant to move it to a public storage site, according to IBM.

“Only 20% of enterprise data is in the cloud today, we have an opportunity to help migrate 80% of mission-critical workloads to the cloud,” IBM said in a statement Monday.

Since becoming CEO last spring, Krishna has moved quickly to implement the transformation plan for IBM. During an investor call in January, Krishna said that he was confident the company’s focus on those areas can help it achieve revenue growth in 2021, reversing a ten-quarter trend of no growth or declines in sales.

Krishna, who previously headed IBM’s cloud division, was the driving force behind the company’s $34 billion purchase of open source software provider Red Hat in 2018, the first step toward transitioning IBM into what it sees as a $1 trillion hybrid-cloud market. The company is also expected to complete a spin off of its managed infrastructure services unit into a separate publicly traded company this year.

9,2021-03-01T13:13:44+00:00,Amazon Union Is a Tough Sell in Town Where $15 an Hour Goes a Long Way,"(Bloomberg) -- On a rainy Saturday afternoon in early February, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union held a rally in a grassy lot a five-minute drive from Amazon.com Inc.’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama. Organizers handed out pizzas supplied by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a long-time Amazon critic. Members of the Teamsters had traveled to Bessemer to lend their support, some from as far away as Boston. Workers and activists brandished signs with such slogans as “Don’t Back Down” and “Our Community Supports Amazon Workers.”

Inclement weather aside, the event seemed to have all the ingredients needed to fire up workers keen to take on Amazon. Yet the crowd that day numbered about 50, including activists, out-of-towners and media, and many of Bernie’s pizzas were uneaten when the rally ended about an hour later.

The campaign in Bessemer has drawn national attention and is widely considered a once-in-a-generation opportunity to breach the defenses of the world’s largest online retailer, which has managed to keep unions out of its U.S. operations for a quarter-century. To prevail, the union needs to win over a majority of the votes cast at Amazon’s BHM1 fulfillment center from among a pool of some 5,800 workers. The RWDSU still has time to win workers’ hearts and minds because mail-in balloting, which started in early February, runs through March 29.

But even workers who support joining the union acknowledge victory is by no means assured. Many of their colleagues see a big employer investing in their impoverished town and offering more than double the minimum wage, with benefits, for entry-level jobs. Fifteen dollars an hour doesn’t go far in cities like New York and San Francisco. But in Bessemer, where a fixer-upper house costs less than a new car, it beats working the cash register at the local Dollar Tree.

On the warehouse floor, according to 16 workers interviewed for this story, opinions are sharply divided, with anti-union sentiment running at least as hot as pro-union passions. Cori Jennings, a 39-year-old mother of five, goes out of her way to avoid union activists staking out the Amazon parking lot. “God forbid you make eye contact,” she says. “You can’t rid of them.” Jennings worries that the RWDSU will chase Amazon out of town and derail her plans of becoming a manager.

Union officials say the company is sowing such fears by flooding the airwaves with anti-union messages and indoctrinating workers during mandatory information sessions. “The challenge is not Alabama. The challenge isn’t Bessemer,” says RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum. “The challenge is the most aggressive anti-union campaign anyone has seen in decades, with unlimited resources and unlimited access to workers.”

Amazon officials say they’re simply providing information about unions so workers understand what membership would mean for them and their day-to-day working lives. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “We don’t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”

President Joe Biden indirectly edged into the fray with a video in which he said workers should be free from company pressure in weighing whether to organize. While not an explicit endorsement of the effort at Amazon, he clearly signaled his preference, saying: “There should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”

Bessemer, located about 16 miles (26 km) southwest of Birmingham, was once a thriving steel town and manufacturing center. For much of the 20th century, U.S. Steel and train-car maker Pullman-Standard employed thousands of locals, catapulting them into the middle class. Then, like many U.S. cities, Bessemer began shedding manufacturing jobs in the 1970s and 1980s. When Pullman-Standard closed its factory in 1981, local officials say, unemployment spiked to 35%. Most everyone knew a family that was affected, and many residents packed up and left.

Today, Bessemer is a quiet place, the stillness broken by the occasional freight train passing through. The 41-square-mile town is dotted with simple single-family homes, many in need of repair. There is a church on every other block, ministering to the city’s 27,000 residents, most of whom are Black. It’s the kind of place where people say hello on the street—even during a pandemic—and tack a “ma’am” or “sir” onto the end of their sentences.

In 2010, Bessemer elected Kenneth Gulley mayor. A transplant who moved to the city from Forkland, Alabama, 25 years ago, Gulley won 73% of the vote with a pledge to create jobs. The town was on the verge of bankruptcy, so his first task was restructuring the debt.

Once Bessemer was on a more solid financial footing, Gulley began selling prospective employers on the city’s attributes—its manufacturing DNA, airport and access to a railroad and three major interstates. Dollar General Corp., the discount retail chain, opened a distribution center; Flex-N-Gate, which manufactures metal and welded components, operates a facility. Blox, a construction firm that builds modular units for hospitals, set up shop in the old Pullman-Standard plant.

Then Gulley landed the big one—persuading Amazon to open a fulfillment center on acreage once owned by U.S. Steel off Powder Plant Road. The 855,000-square-foot facility, the first of its kind in Alabama, put Amazon on the doorstep of Birmingham, the state’s largest city, and meshed with the company’s efforts to speed up delivery to smaller metro areas around the U.S.

For many Bessemer residents, Amazon’s arrival was affirmation that their town had finally entered the 21st century. Yes, the jobs were mostly unskilled, but Amazon was one of the world’s most powerful tech companies. If the criticism of Amazon’s labor practices leveled in recent years by Sanders and employee activists gave some Bessemer residents pause, most focused on the $15-an-hour starting wage and health benefits.

As Gulley hoped, local businesses are already benefiting from Amazon’s presence. A worker at the Waffle House, a two-minute drive from the warehouse, says a steady flow of Amazon employees stop by for hash brown scrambles and grilled cheeses—paying customers who have helped the restaurant survive the pandemic. Gulley, who is 52 and now in his third term, says that while he supports workers’ right to organize, he hopes the union drive doesn’t scare off Amazon and other companies.

The BHM1 fulfillment center opened on March 29, 2020, instantly making Amazon Bessemer’s biggest employer. The company had no difficulty filling the slots, but workers say many new hires quit within weeks of starting because they found the pace arduous or were worried about catching Covid-19, which had started spreading around the U.S. and infected dozens of Amazon workers.

A 26-year-old woman who worked at the facility and requested anonymity to speak freely says she was upset after being reprimanded for not working quickly enough. Over time, her feelings about the job evolved from “just work harder and things will get better” to “this is a sinking ship and, no matter how many holes I plug every night, there are going to be new ones the next day.” She quit in January.

High turnover is typical at Amazon warehouses, so Bessemer was no exception. But in the late summer, a group of workers contacted a union organizer to say they wanted to discuss unionizing. The RWDSU’s Appelbaum says some workers were concerned about the pandemic but mostly were agitating about the expectation that they handle hundreds of products an hour. “I think people want to be treated with dignity,” he says. “They’re not saying it’s about the wages.”

It’s highly unusual for worker activism to take root in one of Amazon’s U.S. warehouses so soon after it has opened. Many recruits are happy with the pay and benefits, and it can take years—not months—for their appreciation to curdle into disappointment. And even then most quit; they don’t approach a union for help. Appelbaum says workers at the Bessemer warehouse, who are mostly African-American, were inspired in part by the Black Lives Matter protests and the growing acceptance that systemic racism has hurt the economic prospects of people of color.

The question, of course, is whether the people who contacted the RWDSU are aligned with a majority of their colleagues. In interviews, many workers acknowledge that the work is hard and the hours long, but they point out that few other local employers offer similar pay and benefits. The minimum wage in Alabama is $7.25 and median pay for unskilled work is paltry: $12.14 for retail salespeople; $11.37 for cashiers and $13.36 for restaurant cooks. The e-commerce giant’s benefits also stand out in Alabama, where health care gobbles up 13.2% of household income, compared with 11.2% nationally, according to a QuoteWizard report.

Many of the new hires hailed from retail or food services, including a cohort who worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. Eric Jones, 51, worked as a cook at the university hospital. In August he joined Amazon as a picker, which involves grabbing items from a robot. The commute from Birmingham requires taking two buses about two hours each way, he’s making only $2 an hour more than his previous job, and at first Jones struggled to pick the prescribed 300 items per hour. But he doesn’t have to pay to see a doctor, likes the flexible hours and recently learned that Amazon will help him get a deal on a car.

While Jones thinks Amazon should do a better job of providing information about confirmed Covid-19 cases, he’s skeptical of how much the union could help. “I know malarkey when I hear it,” he says. “It could benefit us or it could hurt us.”

J.C. Thompson, 43, has been working at Amazon since April and loves it. The job provides affordable medical, dental and vision benefits for his family, which saves him $800 a month and helped pay for his two sons’ braces. Thompson is saving as much as he can for retirement, taking advantage of Amazon’s 401(k) match. He voted no and mailed back the ballot same day he received it. “I think unions are for people who don’t like rules,” says Thompson, who soured on them during 10 years at United Parcel Service Inc.

No one is counting out the union, and workers say there is plenty of support for the RWDSU in the warehouse.

Jennifer Bates, who works in the receiving department and trains other employees, says she initially found working at Amazon exciting. But before long she says managers began pushing breaks back further in her shift so she and her colleagues sometimes went as long as five hours without stopping. Bates, 48, believes the union would give workers a bigger voice and is trying to persuade colleagues to vote yes.

Darryl Richardson, an Amazon worker who also supports joining the RWDSU, says it’s hard selling younger workers on the benefits of union membership. “You’ve got a lot of not educated and young people, and they don’t know about the union,” he says. “Sometimes we can convince them and sometimes we can’t.”

The RWDSU is trying to tap into Bessemer’s union history during its manufacturing heyday. But those jobs started going away a half-century ago, and the unions could do nothing to stop that. Organizers have recruited unionized workers from local poultry plants to proselytize on their behalf. But what sells in wealthier cities resonates less in right-to-work Alabama. Big public rallies are impossible during a pandemic, so the RWDSU is sometimes reduced to posting activists outside the warehouse and trying to grab workers’ attention. Inside, meanwhile, managers are selling Amazon’s position to people paid to be there.

“If the RWDSU loses the campaign, you can always find some strategic missteps, but those will be dwarfed by the size of Amazon’s wealth and its ability to mount an anti-organizing campaign,” says Janice Fine, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University. “They’ve picked a huge fight, and it’s going to be really hard to win.”

10,2021-03-01T13:00:12+00:00,"Netflix, Disney Win Big at a Golden Globes Suited for a Pandemic","(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. emerged as the big winners at the Golden Globe awards, taking home most of the evening’s prizes for their films and television shows, in an awards show tailor-made for the unusual pandemic-affected times.

Disney grabbed the top award, best dramatic motion picture, for “Nomadland,” while the film’s director Chloe Zhao became the second-ever woman to take home that prize. Netflix especially dominated in television, with “The Crown” and “The Queen’s Gambit,” grabbing a handful of awards at the ceremony. In all, the two studios won 15 of the prizes handed out Sunday by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in a NBC broadcast hosted by comic actors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

The dominance of the top global streaming service and the top traditional studio won’t surprise many. For the past year, many theaters have been closed, and the biggest new films have been delayed or put online. That also meant studios had to hold back at least some of their multimillion-dollar marketing budgets, making it harder to suss out clear favorites. Instead, online viewing was on the rise, with even Disney leaning hard into the change, expanding its Disney+ streaming service and debuting top films over the internet.

Netflix shares were up 1.1% to $544.50 and Disney was up 1.7% to $192.30 in premarket trading at 7:57 a.m. Monday in New York.

Other streaming services, particularly Amazon.com Inc., also picked up key prizes. “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” won best picture, musical or comedy, and its star Sacha Baron Cohen won the Golden Globe for his performance. Other winners included Daniel Kaluuya, who was named best supporting actor in a motion picture for his role in “Judas and the Black Messiah,” a Warner Bros. film about the FBI’s infiltration of the Black Panthers. John Boyega was voted best supporting actor in a TV role for his part in “Small Axe,” an Amazon show about London’s West Indian community, and “Schitt’s Creek” captured the award for best TV comedy.

Because of Covid-19, the 78th Golden Globes were held with presenters and winners appearing remotely, unlike past years, when the awards were handed out in a banquet room at the Beverly Hilton hotel before a TV audience of millions. They’re also usually held in January, when many awards contenders are still playing in theaters.

An opening monologue from comedians Fey and Poehler highlighted the oddity. Rather than sharing the stage at the Hilton, they spoke from separate stages there and at the Rainbow Room in New York.

“Normally this room is full of celebrities, but tonight our audience on both coasts is made of smoking-hot first responders,” Fey said. “We are so grateful for the work that you do, and that you’re here, so that the celebrities can stay safely at home.”

The picture has been much brighter for TV, which the Globes also celebrate. Millions of people stuck at home in the U.S. and abroad over the past year swarmed to streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, which now count hundreds of millions of subscribers globally.

In addition to winning best television drama, Netflix’s British royal chronicle “The Crown,” saw the actors who played Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Emma Corrin and Josh O’Connor, both take home acting awards. Gillian Anderson won a supporting Golden Globe for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the series.

With film nominees like “Mank” and popular series like “The Crown,” Netflix led the nominations with 42. Disney was second with 20, including a best-picture nod for the movie “Nomadland” and its star Frances McDormand.

The year’s awards also come against the backdrop of controversy surrounding the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group of journalists that chooses the nominees and winners.

Read more: Golden Globes promise to add Black members

A lawsuit filed by a Norwegian journalist who was denied membership accused the organization of corruption, laid out in a series of exposes by the Los Angeles Times. The suit was dismissed, but several members told the newspaper awards can effectively be “bought” with expensive press junkets, among other inappropriate behavior.

The group has also been criticized for failing to have a Black member for at least 20 years and for overlooking some of the buzziest Black-led pictures this year with their film-drama nominations. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and “Da 5 Bloods” are expected to be nominated for best picture at this year’s Academy Awards, according to the website Gold Derby. The Oscar nominations come out on March 15.

The HFPA told the newspaper that none of the allegations had been proven in court, and they reflected “unconscious bias” against its “diverse membership.”

Even with pandemic, the Golden Globes remain a big marketing showcase. Last year’s telecast drew a U.S. TV audience of 18.3 million viewers, putting it among the most-watched nonsports shows of the year. The Oscars, the movie industry’s most-prestigious awards, drew an audience of 24.3 million.

11,2021-03-01T12:03:58+00:00,"Why Costco pays its 180,000 workers way more than the minimum wage","Costco (COST) has always led the way in retail when it comes to paying its workers, so it's no shock to see it step on the gas further to widen its competitive edge versus rivals.

This week, Costco plans to raise the starting wage to $16 an hour for U.S. workers. The decision was first revealed by Costco CEO Craig Jelinek in testimony to the U.S. Senate Budget Committee last week. Costco raised its starting pay to $15 an hour in 2019. More than half of Costco's hourly workers in the U.S. are paid above $25, Jelinek said.

Costco employs roughly 180,000 workers in the country.

""In the U.S., our employees average over nine years of service with the company. Over 60% of U.S. employees have five or more years with Costco, and over one-third have more than 10 years. We’re very proud of the fact that more than 12,000 of our U.S. employees have worked for Costco for 25 years or more. Again, we feel the experience level and loyalty of our employees is a significant advantage for our company,"" explained Jelinek.

The decision to crank up starting wages even higher reflects Costco's DNA, which was coded into the fabric of the warehouse club giant by trailblazing co-founder Jim Sinegal.

Sinegal co-founded Costco in 1983 alongside Jeff Brotman. The face of Costco until his retirement as CEO in 2012, Sinegal was notoriously frugal when it came to spending at its Washington state headquarters and on C-suite pay. Sinegal plowed all of those savings into paying average workers in the retailer's stores and warehouses handsome hourly wages.

The thinking: A happy worker equals a dedicated worker, and that means better customer service, higher sales and club members for life. A well compensated worker also means a greater propensity for them to spend, likely at Costco.

""The more people make, the better lives they're going to have and the better consumers they're going to be,"" Sinegal told The Washington Post in 2007 in a rare interview. ""It's going to provide better jobs and better wages.""

Story continues

At the time of the Post interview, Costco's lowest paid workers made $11 an hour Sinegal said. The average worker made $17 an hour. The federal minimum wage was $5.15 an hour at the time of Sinegal's Post interview, which came as lawmakers were bickering on raising it to $7.25 an hour.

""In my view, some of these industries that pay minimum wage are constantly turning their people. They spend more on turnover than they would in paying the additional wages,"" Sinegal said.

One could easily make the case Sinegal's generous stance on worker compensation — which has continued under his protege Jelinek — has worked very well for Costco.

Costco's sales have ballooned from $77.9 billion in the fiscal year ended Aug. 29, 2010 to $166.7 billion for the fiscal year ended Aug. 30, 2020. The company added nearly $3 billion in net income during that timeframe. The company's membership renewal rate in the U.S. is consistently above an impressive 90%.

From Aug. 29, 2010 to present day, Costco's stock has gained 502%. The S&P 500 has risen 265%. Shares of Walmart (which owns Costco rival Sam's Club) and Target have increased 159% and 258%, respectively.

The focus on Costco's wages arrives as lawmakers again bicker on whether to hike it, this time to $15 an hour over time. President Joe Biden backed off on his call to lift the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of a new COVID-19 relief bill.

Some retailers are trying to get out in front of any increase to the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage, but they still come up short to Costco.

Walmart said in February it's raising wages for 425,000 of its nearly 1.5 million employees. Yahoo Finance's Julia La Roche reported that wages for Walmart’s 425,000 store associates in the digital and stocking workgroups will increase to a range of $13 to $19 per hour, depending on location and market. The pay increase will take effect on March 13.

After the pay hike, La Roche reports that 730,000 Walmart U.S. store workers, approximately half of its workforce, will earn $15 or more per hour. Walmart says the average wage for its U.S. hourly workforce will now be at least $15.25 per hour.

Last July, Target raised its minimum wage for its U.S. workers to $15 an hour.

Costco's sales have ballooned from $77.9 billion in the fiscal year ended Aug. 29, 2010 to $166.7 billion for the fiscal year ended Aug. 30, 2020. The company added nearly $3 billion in net income during that timeframe. The company's membership renewal rate in the U.S. is consistently above an impressive 90%.

From Aug. 29, 2010 to present day, Costco's stock has gained 502%. The S&P 500 has risen 265%. Shares of Walmart (which owns Costco rival Sam's Club) and Target have increased 159% and 258%, respectively.

The focus on Costco's wages arrives as lawmakers again bicker on whether to hike it, this time to $15 an hour over time. President Joe Biden backed off on his call to lift the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of a new COVID-19 relief bill.

Some retailers are trying to get out in front of any increase to the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage, but they still come up short to Costco.

Walmart said in February it's raising wages for 425,000 of its nearly 1.5 million employees. Yahoo Finance's Julia La Roche reported that wages for Walmart’s 425,000 store associates in the digital and stocking workgroups will increase to a range of $13 to $19 per hour, depending on location and market. The pay increase will take effect on March 13.

After the pay hike, La Roche reports that 730,000 Walmart U.S. store workers, approximately half of its workforce, will earn $15 or more per hour. Walmart says the average wage for its U.S. hourly workforce will now be at least $15.25 per hour.

Last July, Target raised its minimum wage for its U.S. workers to $15 an hour.

The company will fold Line Pay into PayPay, backed by SoftBank Corp., its Yahoo Japan unit and India’s Paytm, in April 2022 provided it secures all the relevant regulatory approvals, according to a joint statement from the two payment operators. SoftBank had kept mum on the possibility of a payments merger, saying only it aimed to extract synergies from the overlapping businesses.

Under a complex transaction that takes effect on Monday, SoftBank Corp. and Line’s parent Naver Corp. each own half of a newly created A Holdings Corp. That company in turn controls 65.3% of publicly traded Z Holdings Corp., taking SoftBank’s Yahoo Japan and Line’s operations under its umbrella. The deal was targeted for completion by October but got delayed by pandemic-induced market disruptions. It’s also come under attack from overseas hedge funds that said the tender offer price was too low.

The name is designed to symbolize everything as in “from A to Z,” reminiscent of Amazon.com Inc.’s motto, SoftBank has said. The letters also signify its focus on artificial intelligence and plans to expand in Asia.

PayPay had 36 million users in Japan as of the end of February, while Line Pay had about 39 million. The merger gives PayPay access to over 80 million Japanese users on Line’s messaging service. The former rivals are already combining their respective businesses and Line Pay users will be able to make payments at PayPay locations where QR codes payments are accepted starting second half of April.

Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank founder who backs some of the world’s largest startups, engineered the deal to create a Japanese tech champion that can compete with global rivals like Google, Amazon and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The combined company aims to spend 100 billion yen ($939 million) annually on development of AI-powered products.

Source: Shutterstock

It really hit me during a recent online get together with my subscribers. I asked them whether they owned gold or not.

Holy smokes … I couldn’t keep up with the responses.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I’m not going to tell you to run out and sell your gold, but I do think it is not the holding it once was. It’s time to question whether to own it.

For my money, there’s a newer and better alternative investment. It has the same characteristics but a lot more upside potential …

Stocks slipped about 2% this past week — most of which came on Thursday. The Dow fell 559 points that day and the headlines screamed. The issue was increasing bond yields, which can signal higher interest rates and inflationary pressures.

For as long as anyone can remember, the go-to investment in times of rising rates and inflation has been gold.

Well, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) ETF was down Thursday and Friday, so that didn’t help. And over the past five years, it’s gained just 37%. That’s about a third of the S&P 500’s 96% gain in that same time.

I’ve been telling anyone who will listen about the enormous gains that are possible by owning cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, yes, but especially smaller coins known as altcoins, which have even bigger potential.

Some gold is probably fine for your portfolio, but it is no longer the best hedge against inflation.

That title now belongs to cryptocurrencies.

Like gold, silver, and commodities, bitcoin and some altcoins serve as a store of value during turbulent conditions. In fact, they can be an even better store of value.

In bitcoin’s case, total supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins (and 88% of those have already been “mined”). Cryptos are basically next-generation software, so bitcoin is not a corporation or a government that bends to doing what’s easy or convenient in a given moment. Bitcoin has no president or CEO … no board of directors that can intervene and rain down cash bailouts on the over-spenders.

Story continues

But that’s just a quick glance at why I believe bitcoin is superior to gold right now. Here’s a look at my five strongest reasons …

Supply: Both gold and bitcoin have limited supply, but the argument is more bullish for bitcoin over the long term.

Authenticity: Bitcoin and altcoins can be verified on the blockchain in a matter of seconds. Verifying gold takes much longer and is more expensive.

Transferability: Bitcoin is a digital asset, so it can be sent via the internet to anyone around the world with a connected device. Gold can also be transferred, but delivering a physical bar of gold is not easy (did I mention they’re heavy?) and definitely not safe.

Liquidity: Bitcoin is sold on any number of large, billion-dollar exchanges in a matter of seconds. Gold is not so easily converted into cash, making it a lot less liquid than bitcoin.

Legal Tender: Bitcoin is only 12 years old, but it is already a payment option at many places … with more joining the list each day. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently announced its hope to accept bitcoin as payment for vehicles. Gold, on the other hand, is rarely used to buy goods and services. Can you imagine walking into the mall with a bar of gold in your pocket?

Bottom line: Bitcoin is the new digital gold.

In addition to many of the same hedge benefits as gold, cryptos also give you massive upside potential … especially altcoins.

Quite simply, people are waking up to the fact that cryptocurrencies are one of the most valuable, most revolutionary technologies ever created.

Cryptos and the blockchain technology they are built on are going to change everything. The way you buy everyday goods and services… purchase a home… pay your taxes … even how you order a pizza.

This transformation is already underway, but the truly seismic shift — when the massive profits are made — is coming as businesses, consumers, and those big-money investors realize what’s going on.

As they do, there will be an enormous rush into this asset class. In fact, we’re already seeing it.

In just the last month, bitcoin topped a market value of $1 trillion. Only four U.S. stocks are valued higher, and they are the big boys — Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Investment banks are also stampeding into bitcoin, including the biggest of all. Blackrock is the world’s largest asset management firm with nearly $8.7 trillion under management. The firm’s chief investment officer of global fixed income recently said it has “started to dabble in bitcoin.” That may not sound like much, but don’t underestimate its significance and the credibility it lends to cryptos.

In addition, one of the best-known crypto exchanges is preparing to go public and generating all kinds of buzz. Coinbase could start trading on the Nasdaq as early March. Based on recent shares in Nasdaq Private Markets, it was valued around $100 billion. If that’s the value when shares start trading, it would be the most valuable company to go public since Facebook in 2012.

And then there’s North America’s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Canada, which got off to a blazing start. Purpose Investments’ bitcoin ETF now has nearly $700 million in assets under management after launching a little over one week ago.

This big money realizes that if they don’t adopt a plan today, they will be left behind. The same is true for investors.

But this great crypto awakening is still in its early stages. That means there’s still time to get in for the big money … if you act soon.

18,2021-02-27T14:27:16+00:00,Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller’s Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article we take a look at billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks. The billionaire is making waves as he recently revealed that he is long Bitcoin and considers the cryptocurrency a valuable asset class. You can skip our detailed discussion of Druckenmiller's history, his hedge fund's performance and go to Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's Top 5 Stock Picks.

Stanley Freeman Druckenmiller is an American billionaire and hedge fund manager who founded Duquesne Capital in 1981. For 30 years the hedge fund posted excellent returns, but in 2010 the billionaire announced to shutter the fund citing “emotional toll” of not being able to come up to the high expectations of investors. At the time of closing, the hedge fund had $12 billion in managed securities. Druckenmiller’s hedge fund had posted average gains of 30% over two decades of its operations before it closed, an excellent record when compared to peers. In 2008, when most hedge funds suffered heavy losses and declined 19% on average, Duquesne returned 11%.

Duquesne Capital is now a family office.

The 67-year-old billionaire whose net worth stands at $4.4 billion today worked for legendary investor George Soros until 2000. The duo made a fortune when their bets against the British pound paid off on the famous “Black Wednesday” of 1992. Soros gave control of his hedge fund to Druckenmiller in 1989 to focus on philanthropy.

From Hot Dog Stand to Billions

Born in Pennsylvania, Druckenmiller graduated from Collegiate School, Virginia. In 1975, while doing his bachelor’s in English and Economics from Bowdoin College, Druckenmiller started a hot dog stand with Lawrence B. Lindsey, who later became economic policy adviser to President George W. Bush.

Druckenmiller's investment philosophy gives importance to macroeconomic factors that control the current market environment. Druckenmiller invests in both short and long positions and uses leverage to trade currency and futures.

A ""Raging Mania""

During an interview with CNBC a few months back, the investor talked about the current market situation.

""The stock market is in a mania fueled by the Federal Reserve and investor speculation that will end badly in the coming years.""

Here is what Stanley Druckenmiller stated:

""I think the merging of the Fed and the Treasury which is what's happening during Covid -- is obviously creating a massive ranging mania in financial assets. Everybody loves a party. I love a party. I assume you guys love a party, but inevitably after a big party, there's a hangover. Right now, we're on an absolute-ranging mania. We've got commentators on different networks encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40%, big market companies on stock splits. That creates no value, but the stocks still go up. I have no clue where the market's gonna go in the near term. I don't know when it's going to go up 10%, I don't know when it's going to go down 10%. I just want to remind people that there is no valuation support just because we dropped 10%. That does not matter because we are so far outside the valuation realm with the Fed doing what they're doing, that does not matter. But I would say that the next 3-5 years is going to be very very challenging.""

Druckenmiller Is Long Bitcoin

Druckenmiller recently revealed that he owns Bitcoin. The billionaire said that Bitcoin has a lot of inherent value and it’s gaining traction and stability with each passing day.

Frankly, if the gold bet works, the Bitcoin bet will probably work better because it’s thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it.

Druckermiller's Latest Moves

During the fourth quarter Stan Druckenmiller sold all of his position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), while increasing hold in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE: PANW) by 457%. The fund currently holds $335 million worth of PANW shares, making it Duquesne's 6th biggest holding.

Druckenmiller also trimmed around a fifth of his Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) and Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ: PENN) positions, while dumping his entire stake in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). Duquesne Capital also sold its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) in the fourth quarter of 2020. Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's Top 10 Stock Picks

Druckenmiller isn't the only one who struggled with his returns. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Before we start taking a look at Druckenmiller’s family office's top stock picks, here’s a an ironic remark the billionaire once made about the soaring tech stock prices during a meeting at Soros Fund Management, as reported by the WSJ in 2000.

""I don't like this market. I think we should probably lighten up. I don't want to go out like Steinhardt.""

He was referring to Michael Steinhardt, who closed his hedge fund 1995 after suffering heavy losses.

Let's start our list of Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks.

10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS)

Value: $123,988,000Change in Position Size: 378%Percent of Stan Druckenmiller's 13F Portfolio: 3.3%

Walt Disney ranks 10th on our list of Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks. The California-based mass media company aims to be one of the world's leading producers and providers of entertainment and information. Recently, The Walt Disney was able to clinch the 4th spot on Fortune's 2021 list of the ""World's Most Admired Companies,"" despite losing billions of dollars amid the coronavirus crisis. With a current market capitalization worth $358.5 billion, Walt Disney delivered a 60% return in the past 12 months.

According to our database, the number of Walt Disney’s long hedge funds positions increased at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. There were 144 hedge funds that hold a position in Disney by the end of December, compared to the 112 funds in the third quarter. The biggest stakeholder of the company is Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, with 11 million shares, worth $2 billion.

Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, said that they acquired a position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), and believes that there’s still a wide room for growth in the company. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their investor letter:

""Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

9. Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN)

Value: $128,369,000Change in Position Size: 0%Percent of Stan Druckenmiller's 13F Portfolio: 3.5%

Pennsylvania-based Penn National Gaming is an operator of casinos and racetracks. It currently operates 43 facilities in Canada and America.

""Penn National operates 40 properties (casinos and racetracks) across 20 states. In February. Penn National purchased a 36% interest in Barstool Sports, an online sports media company with 66 million monthly active users. Penn National is using Barstool Sports as the brand of its digital strategy and retains 100% of the sports betting and online casino (iGaming) proceeds in the relationship. Traditional brick¬and-mortar casino gambling in the U.S. is not a growth industry: however, two unique growth areas exist for casino operators: online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming. More states are considering legalization of OSB and iGaming due to Covid¬19-related budget shortfalls, as gambling can raise substantial tax revenue. Importantly, data shows that sports betting and online casinos do not cannibalize brick-and-mortar casino revenues. Additionally, gaming companies must have a physical presence within the states where they seek to have online gambling and sports betting legalized, so Penn National’s brick-and-mortar facilities give the company an advantage in this area. Shares of Penn National performed strongly during the third quarter in response to the company’s brick-and-mortar properties recently generating higher margins compared to pre-Covid-19 levels. a result of the company cutting costs and increased customer spending. Investors also responded favorably to Barstool’s September launch of its Sportsbook app in Pennsylvania. Additionally. sports betting and online gaming levels have reached record highs in numerous states.” Penn National Gaming, Inc (PENN)

Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM)

52-Week Range: $17.83 – $74.83

Story continues

1 year % change: Up about 95%

Dividend Yield: 0.38%

Total Expense Ratio: 0.75%

The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF invests in business that focus on the full lithium supply chain, i.e. from mining and refining the metal all the way to battery production. LIT, which tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index, has 40 stock holdings and since its inception in July 2010, net assets have reached $3 billion.

2020 saw immense consumer and investor interest in electric vehicles (EV) and alternative energy sources. As lithium is preferred over lead-acid batteries, lithium stocks have benefited significantly in the past year. For instance: “Charging a lead-acid battery can take more than 10 hours, whereas lithium ion batteries can take from 3 hours to as little as a few minutes to charge, depending on the size of the battery.”

As far as sectors are concerned, funds are distributed among Materials (42.7%), Industrials (28.5 %), Consumer Discretionary (16.3%) and Information Technology (11.3%), among others. Over 60% of the holdings are in the top ten stocks. Chinese firms comprise 43.9% of the holdings, followed by stocks from the U.S. (21.8%), South Korea (12.0%), Japan (6.6%) and others. Leading names in the fund are Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), Ganfeng Lithium (OTCMKTS:GNENF), Byd (OTCMKTS:BYODY), Samsung and Eve Energy.

Given the significant increase in price, LIT is likely to come under pressure in the coming weeks. However, buy-and-hold investors should regards dips in price as opportunity the into the fund.

1-year price change: Up about 92%

Dividend yield: 0.11%

California-based chip darling Nvidia focuses on personal computer (PC) graphics, graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI). The group operates through two segments: GPU and Tegra Processor.

Its GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets, including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Put another way, the company has a strong product portfolio, which has been the catalyst behind the recent sales growth.

Nvidia reported record revenue of $4.73 billion for the third quarter, up 57% from $3.01 billion a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income was $1.83 billion, a 66% increase YoY. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.91, up 63% from $1.78 a year earlier. Free cash flow was $806 million, down 48% YoY.

CEO Jensen Huang said: “NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders, achieving record revenues in Gaming, Data Center and overall. We are continuing to raise the bar with NVIDIA AI. We swept the industry AI inference benchmark, and our customers are moving some of the world’s most popular AI services into production, powered by NVIDIA technology.”

8 Stocks to Buy for March

NVDA stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 48.08 and 22.98, respectively, pointing to a frothy valuation level. A potential decline toward the $525 level would improve the margin of safety. The work from home trend may take a breather as the economy opens up further. Yet, Nvidia remains one of the most important chip names that belong in a growth portfolio.

52-week range: $2.43 – $67.00

1-year price change: Up 57.81%

Plug Power develops hydrogen fuel cell systems for the industrial market. Recent months have seen increasing enthusiasm for hydrogen as “a clean fuel that, when consumed in a fuel cell, produces only water, electricity and heat. Hydrogen and fuel cells can play an important role in our national energy strategy, with the potential for use in a broad range of applications, across virtually all sectors — transportation, commercial, industrial, residential, and portable.”

An important part of Plug Power’s revenue comes from selling fuel-cells for forklifts used in warehouses by retail giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). According to the most recent quarterly results, net revenue was $83.5 million, compared to $38.9 million a year ago. GAAP net loss increased to $39.4 million, compared to $18.1 million in Q3 2019. GAAP net loss per share came at 11 cents. A year prior, it was 8 cents. Cash and equivalents were $731.4 million, compared to $198.3 million a year earlier.

CEO Andy Marsh said, “I’d like to highlight our operational performance. Company achieved $126 million in gross billings. This represents 106% increase from the third quarter of 2019. This quarter is a strong validation of our business model in years to come.”

PLUG stock’s P/B and P/S ratios are 42.09 and 49.50, respectively. In the case of short-term profit-taking, buy-and-hold investors might find better value around $42.50. The company hopes to achieve $1.2 billion in annual sales by 2024. Although that is an ambitious number that might prove difficult to reach in a couple of years, Plug Power has long-term tailwinds to support the share price.

Starbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy

52-week range: $50.02 – $107.75

1-year price change: Up about 16%

Dividend yield: 1.78%

Specialty-coffee retailer Starbucks needs little introduction. SBUX serves customers with its company-owned and licensed locations, both in the U.S. and worldwide. However store closures due to the pandemic have negatively affected foot traffic and sales.

In late January, Starbucks’s released Q1 earnings. Revenue was $6.7 billion, showing a 5% YoY decrease. Management mainly pointed the finger at Covid-19 for the decline. On the other and, analysts were pleased that the group opened 278 net new stores in Q1 FY21, a 4% YoY unit growth. Earnings came at $622.2 million, a 29.8% drop from the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share fell from 79 cents to 61 cents.

CEO Kevin Johnson cited, “Investments in our partners, beverage innovation and digital customer relationships continued to fuel our recovery and position Starbucks for long-term, sustainable growth.”

8 Stocks to Buy for March

SBUX stock’s forward price-earnings and price-sales ratios are at 36.4 and 4.12, respectively. As economies worldwide continue to open up, I expect Starbucks to get back its customers and sales to rebound. Long-term investors could buy the dips.

52-week range: $2.43 – $67.00

1-year price change: Up about 36%

Dividend yield: N/A

Canada-headquartered cannabis producer Tilray has been making headlines in recent weeks. In mid-December, the group announced an upcoming merger with another Canadian pot marijuana business, Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA). The combined entity will become the largest pot company in the world, based on pro forma revenue. Following the news TLRY stock hit a 52-week high of $67 in February. However since then, profit-taking has kicked it and shares are now around $26.

Tilray announced Q4 and 2020 year end financial results on Feb. 17. Accordingly, total revenue increased to $56.6 million, up 20.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net loss was $3.0 million, or 2 cents per share. A year ago, the comparable numbers were a net loss of $219.8 million and losses of $2.14 per share.

Although the metrics showed increased revenue in the company’s cannabis segment, analysts concur that neither the Canadian recreational/adult segment nor the international or Canadian medical segments are large enough to provide further sustained support to the stock price. In fact, investors decided to hit the “sell” button following the results.

After the U.S. Presidential election in November, pot stocks took center stage, contributing to the rapid rise in price. Now volatility seems to be back for the sector as the market wonders whether U.S. legalization is indeed in the cards soon. Therefore, we are likely to see wild price swings in most marijuana names, including TLRY stock. Interested investors should regard declines toward $20 or below as better entry points.

Uber Technologies (UBER) 2 Critical Reasons Uber Stock Will Weather the Pandemic

52-week range: $13.71 – $64.05

1-year price change: Up about 37%

San Francisco, California-based Uber’s platform matches carriers with customers to move people, food and things through cities, both stateside and overseas. The platform is best known for its Uber ride-hailing app, but despite the declines in taxi rides during the pandemic, Uber’s food delivery business was a bright star for the company’s bottom line.

According to quarterly metrics announced on Feb. 20, Q4 revenue was $ 3.2 billion, down 16% YoY. Net loss was $968 million, an improvement of 12% compared the loss of $1.09 million a year ago. Net loss included $236 million in stock-based compensation expense. Diluted loss per share was 54 cents.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi cited, “While 2020 certainly tested our resilience, it also dramatically accelerated our capabilities in local commerce, with our Delivery business more than doubling over the year to a nearly $44 billion annual bookings run-rate in December.”

8 Stocks to Buy for March

UBER stock’s P/S and P/B ratios are 9.19 and 8.81, respectively. As economies start going back to “normal,” Uber could potentially see considerable upside in the coming quarters, especially in its ridesharing operations.

52-week range: $97.02 – $588.84

1-year price change: Up about 280%

Zoom, founded in 2011, has become one of the most important stocks of 2020. The San Jose, California-based group provides a video communications platform that has become an instant hit in recent months.

It announced its Q3 results on Dec.1. Revenue was $777.2 million, up 367% YoY. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million as compared to $25 million a year ago. The income translated into 99 cents per share vs. 9 cents of diluted EPS in Q3 2019. Free cash flow stood at $388 million.

CEO Eric S. Yuan commented, “We finish the fiscal year with an increased total revenue outlook of approximately $2.575 billion to $2.580 billion for fiscal year 2021, or approximately 314% increase YoY.” According to management’s guidance, full fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $2.89 to $2.91. Zoom will release its fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2020 in early March.

ZM stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 131.33 and 63.09, respectively, showing an expensive valuation. Potential long-term investors could consider investing in the videoconferencing king around $375 or lower.

On the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil is both long and short Zoom stock.

SBUX stock’s forward price-earnings and price-sales ratios are at 36.4 and 4.12, respectively. As economies worldwide continue to open up, I expect Starbucks to get back its customers and sales to rebound. Long-term investors could buy the dips.

Canada-headquartered cannabis producer Tilray has been making headlines in recent weeks. In mid-December, the group announced an upcoming merger with another Canadian pot marijuana business, Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA). The combined entity will become the largest pot company in the world, based on pro forma revenue. Following the news TLRY stock hit a 52-week high of $67 in February. However since then, profit-taking has kicked it and shares are now around $26.

Tilray announced Q4 and 2020 year end financial results on Feb. 17. Accordingly, total revenue increased to $56.6 million, up 20.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net loss was $3.0 million, or 2 cents per share. A year ago, the comparable numbers were a net loss of $219.8 million and losses of $2.14 per share.

Although the metrics showed increased revenue in the company’s cannabis segment, analysts concur that neither the Canadian recreational/adult segment nor the international or Canadian medical segments are large enough to provide further sustained support to the stock price. In fact, investors decided to hit the “sell” button following the results.

After the U.S. Presidential election in November, pot stocks took center stage, contributing to the rapid rise in price. Now volatility seems to be back for the sector as the market wonders whether U.S. legalization is indeed in the cards soon. Therefore, we are likely to see wild price swings in most marijuana names, including TLRY stock. Interested investors should regard declines toward $20 or below as better entry points.

52-week range: $13.71 – $64.05

1-year price change: Up about 37%

San Francisco, California-based Uber’s platform matches carriers with customers to move people, food and things through cities, both stateside and overseas. The platform is best known for its Uber ride-hailing app, but despite the declines in taxi rides during the pandemic, Uber’s food delivery business was a bright star for the company’s bottom line.

According to quarterly metrics announced on Feb. 20, Q4 revenue was $ 3.2 billion, down 16% YoY. Net loss was $968 million, an improvement of 12% compared the loss of $1.09 million a year ago. Net loss included $236 million in stock-based compensation expense. Diluted loss per share was 54 cents.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi cited, “While 2020 certainly tested our resilience, it also dramatically accelerated our capabilities in local commerce, with our Delivery business more than doubling over the year to a nearly $44 billion annual bookings run-rate in December.”

UBER stock’s P/S and P/B ratios are 9.19 and 8.81, respectively. As economies start going back to “normal,” Uber could potentially see considerable upside in the coming quarters, especially in its ridesharing operations.

52-week range: $97.02 – $588.84

1-year price change: Up about 280%

Zoom, founded in 2011, has become one of the most important stocks of 2020. The San Jose, California-based group provides a video communications platform that has become an instant hit in recent months.

It announced its Q3 results on Dec.1. Revenue was $777.2 million, up 367% YoY. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million as compared to $25 million a year ago. The income translated into 99 cents per share vs. 9 cents of diluted EPS in Q3 2019. Free cash flow stood at $388 million.

CEO Eric S. Yuan commented, “We finish the fiscal year with an increased total revenue outlook of approximately $2.575 billion to $2.580 billion for fiscal year 2021, or approximately 314% increase YoY.” According to management’s guidance, full fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $2.89 to $2.91. Zoom will release its fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2020 in early March.

ZM stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 131.33 and 63.09, respectively, showing an expensive valuation. Potential long-term investors could consider investing in the videoconferencing king around $375 or lower.

27,2021-02-26T19:39:13+00:00,3 Short-Squeeze Stocks for Long-Term Bullish Profits,"“They’re back!!” Well kinda, sorta. I’m referring to this week’s rematch pitting David versus Goliath in some of the market’s most heavily shorted stocks. But for investors interested in the next big thing and short-squeeze stocks sporting more sustainable staying power, the following three names are offering attractive opportunities off and on the price chart.

A short-squeeze stock media circus has cooled. And the nightly news is back dutifully covering how Main Street is faring beyond Wall Street as we pass the one-year milestone of living with the novel coronavirus. But “Gamestonk!!” or rather GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and a few others have had their short-squeeze playbooks dusted off this week by that rogue band of merry retail traders from Robinhood and Reddit’s WallStreetBets for a second round of over-the-top crusading.

How the price action will turn out on any given day is anyone’s guess. But there’s little doubt bears in short-squeeze stocks will make hay, if they get out alive, in many of those names they have in their crosshairs. The fact is more than a few of those heavily shorted companies’ prospects are grim at best. Still, those market pros are far from perfect.

It’s also true those typically larger and sophisticated bearish operatives have been wrong before and forced to permanently concede their position. And in some instances, once heavily shorted, short-squeeze stocks have turned into long-term and even phenomenal winners for bullish investors. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are prime examples. More recently, last year’s incredible 700% rally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cost those traders more than $39 billion in 2020. Silly bears.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

The trio of short-squeeze opportunities for investors:

iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) fuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)

Given history can repeat and with an eye on the next big market disrupting business, let’s dive into three of today’s short-squeeze stocks the so-called smart money may also have completely wrong in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

Short-Squeeze Stocks to Buy: iRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) weekly cup with irregular high handle

The first of our short-squeeze stocks to buy is iRobot. Earlier this month, the maker of the Roomba and Braava robot cleaning devices easily topped Street views and delivered double-digit profit and sales growth for the company’s fourth quarter. The outfit also hiked its full-year 2021 guidance well-above consensus forecasts.

iRobot currently maintains short interest of 23%. And this short-squeeze stock did see an explosion in its share price during late January’s brief coup by investors riding the coattails of GME stock. Today, conditions have quieted and that’s looking increasingly good for IRBT stock investors.

On the weekly price chart, January’s cup-shaped breakout has since found IRBT shares retreating into Fibonacci zone support modestly beneath the pattern high. Axing out January’s over-the-top short squeeze stock reaction and combined with solid fundamentals, what we’re left with is a bullish ‘high handle’ that looks good for cleaning up tomorrow.

FuboTV (FUBO) fuboTV (FUBO) uptrend testing in progress

The next of our short-squeeze stocks to buy is FuboTV. Amid Covid-19’s various restrictions the company’s streaming live sports platform has become an essential service for many individuals. Bullish preliminary guidance issued in late January looks to back up FuboTV’s popularity. Next week, investors will have the chance to see what that actually looks like when FUBO reports earnings on Tuesday.

Earnings reactions can be crapshoot. At the end of the day, it’s not just about a couple numbers. As well, for better or worse, sentiment can prove a much more meaningful motivator in the short term. Longer term, though, and with FuboTV also moving to integrate sports betting into its platform later this year, a slam dunk for shareholders that stay the course makes this short-squeeze stock an even better wager.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Technically, FUBO stock is in a testing position of an uptrend line backed by two layers of Fibonacci support. In our estimation, it’s a nice enough spot for investors to pick up this short-squeeze stock at an attractive discount and in front of a third potential and maybe much longer-lasting knockout to bears.

Beyond Meat (BYND) Beyond Meat (BYND) testing channel support

The last of our short-squeeze stocks to buy is Beyond Meat. Since coming public in 2019, the faux meat upstart has maintained its share of skeptical shorts. Today the count stands at 23% of BYND’s float. Last night, those bears were looking to take a bite out of the stock after the company reported a wider-than-forecast quarterly loss. Instead, the meal turned into a quick and smaller snack.

Deals also announced after Thursday’s closing bell which have Beyond Meat working with fast-food giants McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum Brands! (NYSE:YUM) rightfully stole the show, as well as the bears’ ammo. And in Friday’s session shares have firmly reversed the after-hours weakness and added about 3.50% in finger-licking-good activity.

Technically, shares are in a testing position of key Fibonacci levels tied to key lows from March 2020 and January. The decline from this short-squeeze stock’s January price spike has also challenged BYND’s lifetime 50% level, while maintaining the integrity of a bullish up-channel that’s formed over the past year. It’s bullish, but I’ll concede this one still needs to be cooked a bit longer before buying shares.

28,2021-02-26T19:20:32+00:00,SolarWinds’s Security Practices Questioned by Lawmakers,"(Bloomberg) -- SolarWinds Corp.’s security practices in the years leading up to a major cyber-attack by suspected Russian hackers, who leveraged the company’s software to infiltrate government agencies and private-sector companies, were questioned by lawmakers in Washington.

At a Friday hearing on the hack by two House committees, Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, asked SolarWinds representatives about reports of lax security at the company.

Kevin Thompson, who served as chief executive officer at the time of the breach, defended SolarWinds, saying it had beefed security in recent years and spent more than most technology companies of similar size.

“I believe that we have, over the history of time, taken security seriously -- security of our internal systems, and the secure development of our products,” said Thompson, the former SolarWinds CEO.

The cyber-attack was revealed in December after FireEye Inc. discovered it while investigating a breach of its own. The hackers implanted malicious code into SolarWinds’s popular Orion software, and as many as 18,000 customers received it while updating the software. Far fewer were actually targeted for secondary attacks -- about 100 companies and nine U.S. agencies, according to the White House.

A persistent question has been how the hackers originally breached SolarWinds. At the hearing, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said the company was still investigating but had narrowed it to three possible methods. The hackers may have used a technique called “password spraying,” where the attackers “spray” passwords at a large volume of usernames. A second possibility was that the hackers stole credentials, he said, while the third was a breach of a third-party application used by SolarWinds.

Among the alleged security lapses at SolarWinds that were raised at the hearing was the use of the password “solarwinds123.” A cybersecurity researcher said he notified SolarWinds in 2019 that the password --- to one of its servers -- had leaked online.

Story continues

In addition, lawmakers asked the SolarWinds representatives about a former security adviser who had recommended ways to improve cybersecurity and had stated that “the survival of the company depends on an internal commitment to security.”

The hearing was the second time this week that lawmakers heard from technology executives about the cyber-attack. Executives from cybersecurity companies and SolarWinds appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Feb. 23 -- at a hearing in which lawmakers criticized Amazon Web Services for failing to appear before the committee despite an invitation. AWS wasn’t invited to Friday’s hearing, according to a committee aide.

Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, asked about reports the hackers used AWS servers to launch some of the attacks.

Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft Corp. and a witness at Friday’s hearing, responded by explaining the need for transparency about cyber-attacks, drawing a contrast between his company and Amazon. “I am here today. I am answering all your questions. Microsoft has published 32 blogs since this came to light. Amazon has yet to publish its first.”

An Amazon.com Inc. representative said the company wasn’t affected by “the SolarWinds issue” and didn’t use their software. The cyber-attack “demonstrated the security strengths of the cloud and the importance of modernizing legacy IT systems,” the representative said.

Bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee and technology executives who testified at the hearings called for a federal data breach notification law that would require companies to notify the federal government of cyber-attacks. Thompson, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said at Friday’s hearing that he would support such a measure.

29,2021-02-26T17:55:52+00:00,Google’s Stadia Problem? A Video Game Unit That’s Not Googley Enough,"(Bloomberg) -- Google’s streaming video game service Stadia had ambitious plans to disrupt the gaming industry, which is dominated by consoles. The tech giant had planned to pack Stadia with original content, announcing two years ago that it was hiring hundreds of game developers and starting studios in Los Angeles and Montreal.

But those teams barely had time to get started before they were dismissed earlier this month as Google shut down in-house game development.

From the beginning, Google’s approach to video games wasn’t very Google-like. The Alphabet Inc. company tends to launch bare-bones products and test them as they grow. With Stadia, it came out big. Flashy press conferences and ad campaigns promised high-quality games with innovative features playable on Android smartphones or on the TV through Chromecast. Gamers would have access to a library of exclusive titles and well-known favorites like Assassin’s Creed without having to dish out $500 for Sony Corp.’s PlayStation or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

So when Stadia launched in 2019, gamers were expecting the complete package, not the beta model. While the cloud streaming technology was there, playing to Google’s strengths, the library of games was underwhelming and many of the promised features nonexistent. Other platforms offer hundreds of games a year, but Stadia offers fewer than 80, according to Mat Piscatella, an analyst at the NPD Group, which tracks video game sales data.

Players also didn’t like Stadia’s business model, which required customers to buy games individually rather than subscribe to an all-you-can-play service à la Netflix or the Xbox’s Game Pass. Paying as much as $60 for a single game, for it only to exist on Google’s servers rather than on your own PC, seemed a stretch to some. After all the hype, gamers were disappointed. Stadia missed its targets for sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Story continues

“I think it would be fair to say the messaging leading up to and around the launch was inconsistent,” with the final product, Piscatella says.

Stadia’s struggles are a warning sign for other prospective video game streaming services. Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc., both deep-pocketed major technology companies with experience in video games, have ambitions in the area with their respective xCloud and Luna offerings. But those products have rolled out gradually, rather than promising to be console-killers, keeping expectations in check.

It didn’t have to be this way. Google actually had a beta version of Stadia in 2018. Called Project Stream, it allowed users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s popular game Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the tab of a Chrome browser. Fans were impressed.

The following year, at the Game Developers Conference, Phil Harrison, who is in charge of Stadia, unveiled what he called the “future of gaming.” He promised that Stadia would be more powerful than PlayStation or Xbox. He showed off innovative features like State Share, which would allow users to take snapshots of their games and share them with friends, allowing those friends to jump into the same game exactly where they had left off.

The prospects were exciting to fans and pundits, who predicted that Stadia could dominate the market, offering many of the same games as Xbox and PlayStation without the hefty price tag.

But all the buildup had some developers within Stadia worried, according to people familiar with the matter. Their deadline to ship the platform in the fall of 2019 wouldn’t allow them to deliver what players expected, they said. They argued that Google should position the launch as another beta test. After all, Google’s most successful products had followed a similar approach. Gmail was officially in beta testing for five years, for example, as the company continued to tweak and refine it.

There was resistance from Harrison and others on the Stadia leadership team, many of whom had come from the world of traditional console development and wanted to follow the route they knew.

Harrison had positioned Stadia as a traditional gaming platform full of bells and whistles, but that didn’t mesh with Google’s own mantra to “think big but start small,” as detailed in a 2011 blog post by longtime Google executive Susan Wojcicki, now chief executive officer of YouTube. “Watching users ‘in the wild’ as they use our products is the best way to find out what works, then we can act on that feedback,” she wrote. “It’s much better to learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far down the wrong path.”

A British video game industry veteran, Harrison was a prominent face at both PlayStation and Xbox during their worst console launches — the overpriced PlayStation 3 and badly managed Xbox One. He joined Google in 2018 as vice president of Stadia.

His team wooed big-name publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., shelling out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption II on Stadia, according to two people familiar with the deals. The amount of money Google was willing to spend came as a shock to veteran game developers, but even that wasn’t enough. Video game platforms live or die on exclusive content. So Harrison also brought in Jade Raymond, a veteran executive who has worked on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars, to start building an in-house development division.

When Stadia officially released on Nov. 19, 2019, it left critics scratching their heads. The library of games was small and mostly old, with none of Google’s exclusives available yet. Most of the features Harrison promised were not actually there, such as the State Share concept. The platform was only available through a $130 kit that included a special controller and Chromecast. Gaming website Kotaku called the marketing “random and terrible” and the platform failed to catch on. In fact, the company produced so many more Stadia controllers than it had demand for, that last year it gave them away for free.

Despite the tepid launch, there was optimism among Stadia’s developers that they could win over fans with exclusive games, so long as Google gave them time to thrive. They were excited about game prototypes that could only work on a cloud platform, pushing memory limits with computer-driven artificial intelligence. One prototype, according to people familiar with the plans, was described as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet, allowing players to interact with smart creatures in all sorts of fun ways.

Then on Feb. 1, Google suddenly pulled the plug on in-house development. Stadia will still exist as a service and continue to offer third-party games that are also available on other platforms. But without exclusives, Stadia has little hope of competing with big consoles or building an audience of millions. It seems unlikely to be the “future of gaming” that Harrison had promised.

While Stadia didn’t seem to follow the traditional Google playbook, without some drastic changes it could still face a pretty Googley outcome: being added to the long list of products that Google has killed.

Top Stock Reports for Amazon, Chevron and Citigroup

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon, Chevron and Citigroup. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Amazon shares have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index over the past year (+58.6% vs. +28.1%), though the stock has lagged lately in solidarity with other large-cap Tech stocks in response to the uptrend in long-term interest rates. The Zacks analyst remains optimistic about the company's long-term prospects on the back of solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and an expanding original content portfolio.

The company reported impressive fourth-quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues topped the estimates and grew on a year-over-year basis. Robust holiday performance of the company was a major positive. Further, strengthening AWS services and its growing adoption rate contributed well.

However, accelerating coronavirus related expenses remain headwinds for the company's margin expansion in the near term. Also, rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Google poses a risk.

Shares of Chevron have gained +22% in the last six months against the Zacks Integrated Oil industry's gain of +30.2%. The Zacks analyst believes that Chevron's Noble Energy takeover has expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin along with the addition of cash-generating offshore assets in Israel.

Story continues

While the company has struggled with depressed demand stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, it has reiterated its commitment to its dividend on a number of occasions. Consequently, Chevron is viewed as a preferred energy major to own now.

Furthermore, it seems one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. America's No. 2 energy company's existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.

Citigroup shares have gained +20.1% over the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry's gain of +24.5%. The Zacks analyst believes that Citigroup's streamlining efforts, along with strategic investments in core business, bode well.

Also, net interest revenues will likely be supported by loan growth and mix, despite the low interest-rate environment. Further, manageable debt level makes Citigroup less likely to default interest and debt repayment obligations in case of any economic downturn.

Video Transcript

- Chicago Public school teacher Quentin Washington has been teaching remotely since the pandemic began in early 2020.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: But what I love is, I love to see the kids interact with each other in this virtual space.

- But earlier this month, the music teacher and Chicago native received some good news. He was finally going back to his classroom for in-person learning. Thanks to the Chicago Teachers Union, which Washington is a part of, and the city government, K to 12 educators were finally getting their vaccine shots, allowing the school district to reopen schools that had been closed for months.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: And my appointment was this afternoon. So I actually just came home from having the first vaccine. But I'm glad to get it. It gives me a certain sense of security. And I think that every teacher deserves to have that before they're forced back into a building.

- But not all teachers across the country have been this fortunate. While Chicago's teachers had their unions fight for them and successfully reach a common ground with other stakeholders, which includes parents and city officials, others haven't had the same success. Since the pandemic first started spreading in the US, many school districts across the country have halted in-person learning, instead offering a fully virtual or a hybrid classroom to millions of K to 12 students.

The lack of in-person learning has been a major pain point for parents, who feel overwhelmed with balancing work and childcare responsibilities. But reopening isn't a simple process. Many teachers and their unions have stressed the need for their safety and well-being.

According to EducationWeek's estimates, as of February 24, 833 active and retired K to 12 educators and personnel have died of COVID-19. It makes sense when 85% of educators in an American Federation of Teachers survey said that they'd go back to school if they were given priority for COVID-19 vaccines. But as of February 22, teachers in 18 states were still not eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Story continues

This acrimonious dispute over reopenings has pitted many officials, parents, teachers, unions, and workers in K to 12 education in many different states against one another. One of those states is Texas. Jimmy Lee has been in education for 33 years, and is the President of the Association of Texas Professional Educators.

JIMMY LEE: And we have been asking the state to push the educators in the state up into the grouping so that they can get the vaccine, those who are willing to take that. And I think the majority of them are, because they want to continue to do what is needed in the classroom.

- On the other side of the country, the pandemic and the debate over reopening has also laid bare the fundamental problems that exist within school systems. In Rochester City's school district, middle school math teacher, Tom Rossiter, said the lack of financial resources has just been frustrating to deal with.

- So my district in particular, in Rochester City schools, realized last year that we were in a dramatic budget shortfall and laid off hundreds of teachers during the year last year. And then we got hit with a pandemic. And March 13 was our last day. And then we didn't have the finances to do a lot of the things that many other schools were able to do.

- The school district is considered to be chronically underfunded and faces possibly more cuts to the system. This will complicate teaching and learning even further, says Rossiter.

TOM ROSSITER: Our technology issues are so significant for all of our students not having access to internet at home and having to do MiFis and personal hotspots that have data limits, so the kids can't share videos and can't be as actively participating in lessons as many other students would be able to.

- Mark Luxemberg, who's also in Rochester, said it felt genuinely frightening to go back to school amid COVID-19 due to his personal illness.

MARK LUXEMBERG: I suffer from three chronic autoimmune diseases. I didn't return to teaching until October 1 because I tried to make an accommodation with my school under the Americans with Disabilities Act to teach fully remote from home. And I was denied that option. And I was scared to death to go back in September. And I took the majority of my sick days before I agreed to come back October 1.

- Teachers in Chicago were able to avoid this specific scenario.

LORI LIGHTFOOT: --that our children will be returning to in-person learning this week.

At long last, CPS has finally reached a tentative agreement, with the Chicago Teachers Union, that opens up the school doors for safe, in-person learning for our pre-K, cluster, and K through 8 students.

- But finding that common ground was a hard-won battle. And it took a lot of commitment on both sides to compromise.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: I know here in Chicago, one of the reasons that we've had such a hard time is because our school districts feel like they don't have to have those conversations with us. They're the boss. They can tell us what they want us to do and we're just supposed to do it.

So how do we find common ground? It starts with a conversation. It starts with an honest, candid conversation about where we are, where we would like to see ourselves, and what are some of the best ideas of getting us back into that place?

- Meanwhile, at the federal level, the White House continues to push schools to reopen across the country. Back in August, the Trump administration had doubled down on its efforts to reopen schools, holding even a press conference to make their case. During a CNN Town Hall this month, President Biden also said he wanted to reopen schools. He specifically said he wanted to open the majority of K to 8 schools, 5 days a week within his first 100 days. The politicization of the reopening debate has made it much more personal to many.

JIMMY LEE: It is very interesting that politics has influenced and bled over into the public school system. I can see both sides of it. I see some positives. I think the students need to be aware and see that there are people and that we have to learn and we have to try to teach them to be accepting of the fact that there are people who may not believe everything that we believe personally. And that's OK.

- Many experts and parents worry about a possible backslide in children's education due to months of missed in-person learning days. One report by consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated that since 60% of students started the school year fully remote and 20% studied at hybrid, the cumulative learning loss for children could be, quote, ""substantial,"" especially in math, as students may lose 5 to 9 months of learning by the end of this school year. Students of color were even worse off, the report added, as they fall 6 to 12 months behind, as compared to white students falling 4 to 8 months behind. Becky Pringle's National Education Association notes that parents are aware of the challenges teachers face if they were to return to their classrooms, and that there's broader support for unions than publicized widely.

BECKY PRINGLE: Parents, and the larger community, believe in what our teachers have done over this pandemic and actually support our unions speaking up on behalf of our students. I want to be clear about that. So you get the salacious headlines and it's blown up. And I'm not saying it doesn't exist. It does, Reggie. It does exist. But I want to be clear that that's not what's happening in most of our communities.

- And even though it's been a chaotic year for teachers and students, not all was lost.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: Personally, I would not say that this is a lost year. It has been a peculiar year. It hasn't been life as usual, and that's OK. You know why? Because we're in a pandemic. And we're living through a life-altering event that none of us have ever experienced before and we all hope to never have to experience again.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yf-spotlight-american-educators-search-110000575.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'BNTX.US', 'CRM.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'IHSEF.US', 'MRNA.US', 'MSFT.US', 'PCOK.US', 'PFE.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SPXL.US', 'STCO.US']","['CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOL', 'CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION', 'SCHOOL DISTRICTS']","{'polarity': 0.921, 'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.068}"

Video Transcript

- What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world. And the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called Figs, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the health care sector is and the workers there on the frontline each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth, who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

- Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh, my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure. And Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman, was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group. Certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing hopefully some business acumen, and then the tech side. But it just allows us a lot of flexibility. We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that, and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

Story continues

- Right. So I can see that it's not private equity per se or venture, anything like that. Permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life. And there was a moment-- I don't think he'd might be sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about it. And he stopped me and he goes, I got to be honest.

For years, Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here? And I kind of laughed, and he said, no, I'm dead serious. We always ask-- we don't want to be in the clever pile-- what can we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations. And he's incredibly sharp.

One of those states is Texas. Jimmy Lee has been in education for 33 years, and is the President of the Association of Texas Professional Educators.

JIMMY LEE: And we have been asking the state to push the educators in the state up into the grouping so that they can get the vaccine, those who are willing to take that. And I think the majority of them are, because they want to continue to do what is needed in the classroom.

- On the other side of the country, the pandemic and the debate over reopening has also laid bare the fundamental problems that exist within school systems. In Rochester City's school district, middle school math teacher, Tom Rossiter, said the lack of financial resources has just been frustrating to deal with.

- So my district in particular, in Rochester City schools, realized last year that we were in a dramatic budget shortfall and laid off hundreds of teachers during the year last year. And then we got hit with a pandemic. And March 13 was our last day. And then we didn't have the finances to do a lot of the things that many other schools were able to do.

- The school district is considered to be chronically underfunded and faces possibly more cuts to the system. This will complicate teaching and learning even further, says Rossiter.

TOM ROSSITER: Our technology issues are so significant for all of our students not having access to internet at home and having to do MiFis and personal hotspots that have data limits, so the kids can't share videos and can't be as actively participating in lessons as many other students would be able to.

- Mark Luxemberg, who's also in Rochester, said it felt genuinely frightening to go back to school amid COVID-19 due to his personal illness.

MARK LUXEMBERG: I suffer from three chronic autoimmune diseases. I didn't return to teaching until October 1 because I tried to make an accommodation with my school under the Americans with Disabilities Act to teach fully remote from home. And I was denied that option. And I was scared to death to go back in September. And I took the majority of my sick days before I agreed to come back October 1.

- Teachers in Chicago were able to avoid this specific scenario.

LORI LIGHTFOOT: --that our children will be returning to in-person learning this week.

At long last, CPS has finally reached a tentative agreement, with the Chicago Teachers Union, that opens up the school doors for safe, in-person learning for our pre-K, cluster, and K through 8 students.

- But finding that common ground was a hard-won battle. And it took a lot of commitment on both sides to compromise.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: I know here in Chicago, one of the reasons that we've had such a hard time is because our school districts feel like they don't have to have those conversations with us. They're the boss. They can tell us what they want us to do and we're just supposed to do it.

So how do we find common ground? It starts with a conversation. It starts with an honest, candid conversation about where we are, where we would like to see ourselves, and what are some of the best ideas of getting us back into that place?

- Meanwhile, at the federal level, the White House continues to push schools to reopen across the country. Back in August, the Trump administration had doubled down on its efforts to reopen schools, holding even a press conference to make their case. During a CNN Town Hall this month, President Biden also said he wanted to reopen schools. He specifically said he wanted to open the majority of K to 8 schools, 5 days a week within his first 100 days. The politicization of the reopening debate has made it much more personal to many.

JIMMY LEE: It is very interesting that politics has influenced and bled over into the public school system. I can see both sides of it. I see some positives. I think the students need to be aware and see that there are people and that we have to learn and we have to try to teach them to be accepting of the fact that there are people who may not believe everything that we believe personally. And that's OK.

- Many experts and parents worry about a possible backslide in children's education due to months of missed in-person learning days. One report by consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated that since 60% of students started the school year fully remote and 20% studied at hybrid, the cumulative learning loss for children could be, quote, ""substantial,"" especially in math, as students may lose 5 to 9 months of learning by the end of this school year. Students of color were even worse off, the report added, as they fall 6 to 12 months behind, as compared to white students falling 4 to 8 months behind. Becky Pringle's National Education Association notes that parents are aware of the challenges teachers face if they were to return to their classrooms, and that there's broader support for unions than publicized widely.

BECKY PRINGLE: Parents, and the larger community, believe in what our teachers have done over this pandemic and actually support our unions speaking up on behalf of our students. I want to be clear about that. So you get the salacious headlines and it's blown up. And I'm not saying it doesn't exist. It does, Reggie. It does exist. But I want to be clear that that's not what's happening in most of our communities.

- And even though it's been a chaotic year for teachers and students, not all was lost.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: Personally, I would not say that this is a lost year. It has been a peculiar year. It hasn't been life as usual, and that's OK. You know why? Because we're in a pandemic. And we're living through a life-altering event that none of us have ever experienced before and we all hope to never have to experience again.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yf-spotlight-american-educators-search-110000575.html,"['AMZN.US', 'BNTX.US', 'CMW.AU', 'CRM.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'IHSEF.US', 'MRNA.US', 'MSFT.US', 'PCOK.US', 'PFE.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SPXL.US', 'STCO.US']","['CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOL', 'CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION', 'SCHOOL DISTRICTS']","{'polarity': 0.921, 'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.068}"

Video Transcript

- What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world. And the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called Figs, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the health care sector is and the workers there on the frontline each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth, who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

- Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh, my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure. And Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman, was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group. Certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing hopefully some business acumen, and then the tech side. But it just allows us a lot of flexibility. We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that, and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

Story continues

- Right. So I can see that it's not private equity per se or venture, anything like that. Permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life. And there was a moment-- I don't think he'd might be sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about it. And he stopped me and he goes, I got to be honest.

For years, Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here? And I kind of laughed, and he said, no, I'm dead serious. We always ask-- we don't want to be in the clever pile-- what can we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations. And he's incredibly sharp. And it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/one-warren-buffett-always-asks-110000181.html,"['AAPL.US', 'AMC.US', 'AMZN.US', 'BRK-A.US', 'BRK-B.US', 'CMCSA.US', 'DIS.US', 'KHC.US', 'NFLX.US', 'VIAC.US', 'VIACA.US', 'YZCFF.US']","['ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE', 'THOMAS TULL']","{'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.161}"

Investing.com -- The global risk rally takes a breather as stocks and commodities around the world sell off. The dollar is rebounding and 10-year bond yields are only just below 1.50%. Stocks are set to resume their slide. The House of Representatives will vote on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package later Friday, but the proposal for a $15 federal minimum wage has been removed. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, February 26th.

1. Global risk rally takes a breather

The furious rally in risk assets around the world is taking a well-earned breather on Friday, with emerging market FX, commodities and equities all following the U.S. lower in varying degrees after the spike in U.S. bond yields on Thursday.

The 10-Year bond yield itself is making an unconvincing recovery, having spiked as high as 1.60% in the wake of a weak Treasury bond auction on Thursday, where the ratio of bids to bonds on sale hit a record low. By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), it was back at 1.48%, but that is still 18 basis points up on the week. The five-year yield, which is more sensitive to expected changes in Federal Reserve policy, has risen 22 basis points this week.

That has all galvanized the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.6% from late Thursday to trade at 90.71, its highest in over a week.

2. House votes on stimulus package; Dems’ minimum wage plan stymied

The U.S. Democratic Party’s attempts to implement a national minimum wage of $15 an hour are effectively dead.

A Senate official ruled on Thursday that the proposal – part of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package making its way through Congress – cannot be passed under Budget Reconciliation provisions, which would allow it to pass with a simple majority. The ruling leaves the provision open to filibusters from Senate Republicans.

The move is unlikely to stop the trend among big private employers from instituting higher minimum wages as they are forced to compete more for staff. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) CEO Craig Jelinek said on Thursday his company will raise starting pay to $16/hour - $1 more than the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Target (NYSE:TGT).

Story continues

The House of Representatives will vote on President Biden’s relief package later in the day, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.

3. Stock sell-off set to resume; Airbnb outperforms after strong outlook

U.S. stocks are set to open lower again, with technology stocks still subject to the greatest selling pressure.

By 6:30 AM ET, Nasdaq 100 futures were down 74 points, or 0.6%, at their lowest in over three weeks. Dow Jones futures, which hit a new all-time high earlier this week, were down 159 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.4%.

Stocks likely to be in focus later include Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), after a weaker-than-expected quarterly update late on Thursday, and AT&T (NYSE:T), which agreed to spin off its DirecTV unit.

Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), having been hit hard by the broad tech sell-off, is set to bounce after it forecast strong growth in bookings this year, which outweighed a sharp IPO-related widening of its net loss in the fourth quarter.

4. ARKK outflows in focus on Tesla, Bitcoin woes

The five most broadly-held funds of Cathie Wood’s ARK family had another $500 billion in outflows on Thursday, according to Bloomberg data.

Wood has invested heavily in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Bitcoin and a number of other tech-focused assets synonymous with the great rally of the last 12 months.

As such, her funds have become something of a barometer for the broader market enthusiasm for such names. Redemption pressure may continue Friday, with Bitcoin down another 8.8% overnight and Tesla down 3.1% in premarket after a report saying that it has become the latest carmaker forced to stop production due to the global shortage of semiconductors.

5. Crude eases from highs

Crude oil prices finally got shook out of their complacency, as the dollar snapped back and participants trimmed long positions ahead of next week’s OPEC+ meeting.

The meeting, due on Thursday, will have to set the group’s output level for April, amid a backdrop of rising speculation that Russia in particular will push for the taps to be reopened in style.

By 6:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 2.2% at $62.15 a barrel, while Brent was down 2.0% at $64.79 a barrel.

Baker Hughes rig count and CFTC positioning data round off the week later, after the latest quarterly update on personal consumer expenditures and the Chicago PMI.

Mandel Ngan/Pool via REUTERS

The power of Big Tech to tamp down potential business rivals stretches all the way into the courtroom, a leading antitrust attorney testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust on Thursday.

John Thorne, a partner with the law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, testified that the Justice Department (DOJ) and state attorneys general lack the resources necessary to effectively enforce their antitrust laws and their cases now pending against Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

“The cases right now against Google are the hardest cases ever litigated in our courts,” Thorne testified, describing the state and federal attorneys handling the lawsuits as great lawyers whose departments are underfunded and underpaid.

“The staff lawyers at DOJ, and the staff lawyers at the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the other states that are in that case, are paid below market, but they are working above market,” Thorne said. “They do not have the same resources that their opponent has.”

Thorne said lawyers working on behalf of the Texas Attorney General requested $43 million from the state’s legislature, solely for the purpose of hiring expert witnesses in what they described as a bidding war. “The answer from the finance chair of the Texas Senate was, “‘I don't think that's gonna be enough money for you. I don't think you can actually win this with that [budget],’” Thorne said.

""Fancy lawyer"" needed for individual antitrust case

The subcommittee’s hearing was focused on solutions to longstanding concerns that Google, as well as Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), have abused their monopoly power.

Another witness, Dr. Hal Singer, managing director for Econ One, told lawmakers that the cards are also stacked against individual players who wish to bring an antitrust case against Big Tech companies, particularly against Amazon, which requires its sellers to arbitrate legal claims individually and outside of court.

Story continues

“To bring an antitrust case against Amazon, by yourself, you'd have to hire a fancy antitrust lawyer and you'd have to hire a fancy antitrust economist, and just the scale doesn't make sense to bring these claims, individually. And so the system is rigged, effectively, to immunize Amazon from antitrust scrutiny, at least in by private complainants,” Singer said.

Antitrust cases can move faster

According to Thorne, sufficient funding for antitrust cases could ensure they don't drag out so long that they're no longer relevant to consumers. “Closely related to resources is how long it takes to get an antitrust trust case to trial,” Thorne said. “If it takes years to investigate, and then years to get the trial, that's a lot of years the public is denied competition, waiting for law enforcement. I know these cases can move faster because I've seen it done.” WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 29: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks via video conference during the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law hearing on Online Platforms and Market Power in the Rayburn House office Building, July 29, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.

Google faces three antitrust lawsuits; one filed in October by the DOJ and 11 states attorneys general; and two others filed in December by coalitions of state attorneys general.

The lawsuits accuse the company of using its monopoly power to exclude rivals from the online search and advertising markets and of improperly entering exclusionary contracts with Apple and other companies that make Google the default search engine on mobile devices; Google is also accused of denying specialized search sites like Expedia (EXPE), Angie’s List, and Yelp (YELP) of “prime real estate” on its search results page.

Facebook is also facing two antitrust lawsuits: one brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seeking to break it up, and another brought by 48 U.S. attorneys general claiming it violates antitrust law by buying up competitors. The competitive practices of Apple and Amazon remain part of ongoing investigations by federal and state officials.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN), Chevron (CVX) and Citigroup (C). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Amazon shares have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index over the past year (+58.6% vs. +28.1%), though the stock has lagged lately in solidarity with other large-cap Tech stocks in response to the uptrend in long-term interest rates. The Zacks analyst remains optimistic about the company's long-term prospects on the back of solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and an expanding original content portfolio.

The company reported impressive fourth-quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues topped the estimates and grew on a year-over-year basis. Robust holiday performance of the company was a major positive. Further, strengthening AWS services and its growing adoption rate contributed well.

However, accelerating coronavirus related expenses remain headwinds for the company’s margin expansion in the near term. Also, rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Google poses a risk.

(You can read the full research report on Amazon here >>>)

Shares of Chevron have gained +22% in the last six months against the Zacks Integrated Oil industry’s gain of +30.2%. The Zacks analyst believes that Chevron’s Noble Energy takeover has expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin along with the addition of cash-generating offshore assets in Israel.

While the company has struggled with depressed demand stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, it has reiterated its commitment to its dividend on a number of occasions. Consequently, Chevron is viewed a preferred energy major to own now.

Furthermore, it seems one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. America’s No. 2 energy company’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.

Citigroup shares have gained +20.1% over the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s gain of +24.5%. The Zacks analyst believes that Citigroup’s streamlining efforts, along with strategic investments in core business, bode well.

Also, net interest revenues will likely be supported by loan growth and mix, despite the low interest-rate environment. Further, manageable debt level makes Citigroup less likely to default interest and debt repayment obligations in case of any economic downturn.

Notably, the company announced the resumption of buybacks in first-quarter 2021. However, pending litigation issues might keep legal expenses elevated for the company. Additionally, a subdued consumer banking business might dent Citigroup's fee income base to some extent.

51,2021-02-25T15:56:44+00:00,5 Reasons Why BofA Is Bullish On Overstock.com After The Q4 Print,"Overstock.com Inc's (NASDAQ: OSTK) has transformed to a greater degree than peers, with accelerating online sales of home furnishings, and the company seems poised to “potentially” sustain full-year retail growth and positive EBTIDA, according to BofA Securities.

The Overstock Analyst: Ryan Gee upgraded Overstock from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $88 to $91.

The Overstock Thesis: While there continues to be uncertainty around the shift in buying behavior from offline retail peers to Overstock, the “durability of the company’s mindshare gains is reason to be incrementally constructive,” Gee said in the upgrade note.

The analyst named five reasons for the positive view:

Overstock “grew faster than overall home furnishings” in 2020 and doubled its new customers, he said. Overstock's guidance of “mid-single digits” margins for 2021 came in better than the Street’s 4%, Gee said. The new CMO hire from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) “may enhance branding and mobile offering.” Favorable U.S. housing trends are tailwinds to home furnishings, Gee said. “Offloading blockchain businesses clarifies the value prop and could accelerate L.T. value creation,” the analyst said.

OSTK Price Action: Shares of Overstock were up 1.22% at $73.82 at last check Thursday.

53,2021-02-25T14:19:16+00:00,Blockbuster movies will come back after COVID-19: former Legendary Entertainment CEO,"U.S. box office revenue dropped 80% last year, a Comscore report found last month, hitting a 40-year low and reinforcing industry concerns that hit films may not return after the explosion of streaming amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

But in a recent interview, Thomas Tull — a billionaire former film producer behind blockbuster movies like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World"" — said hit movies would remain after the pandemic, even if they're increasingly watched in the home rather than the movie theater.

Top filmmakers will continue to make movies seen around the world, Tull said, but he acknowledged that the prevalence of streaming services will change how the industry monetizes films since they use ""completely different metrics.""

When asked whether blockbuster movies have become a thing of the past, Tull says, ""I don't think so.""

""I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than the imagination,"" says Tull, the former CEO of film production company Legendary Entertainment, who now runs a holding company called Tulco. ""Everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.""

""I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment,"" he adds. ""It was kind of surreal.""

COVID-19 has ""accelerated what was already happening,"" further sidelining the movie theater segment of the business and hastening the rise of streaming services, Tull said.

AT&T-owned WarnerMedia (T) sent shockwaves through the movie industry in December when it announced that it would release 2021 Warner Bros. movies simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming service when they hit movie theaters. The move began with ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" a highly anticipated action movie released on Dec. 25 starring Gal Gadot; it will continue with major upcoming movies such as ""Dune"" and ""Matrix 4.""

Story continues

The WarnerMedia decision drew backlash from prominent filmmakers, including Christopher Nolan, who called the situation ""very, very, very, very messy."" Last week, director Martin Scorsese added his voice to the chorus critical of the rise of streaming, saying in an essay for Harper's Magazine that the platforms worsen the quality of film because their algorithms prize consumer appeal over taste.

Tull, who worked with Nolan on ""Batman Begins"" and other films, said top filmmakers will continue to create captivating work, no matter how it reaches audiences.

""Besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg — all these incredible storytellers,"" Tull says. ""I think at the heart of this, that it's part of our cultural fabric.""

""We're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront,"" he adds. ""It's just going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently."" Thomas Tull, the CEO of the holding company Tulco, speaks with Andy Serwer on an episode of ""Influencers with Andy Serwer.""

Tull spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.

Since 2017, Tull has led Tulco, a holding company that helps businesses in various sectors improve through the deployment of artificial intelligence and other technical advances. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of the film production company Legendary Entertainment.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance, Tull said that the rise of streaming services allows for greater flexibility in visual storytelling.

""The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is it used to be something was a two-ish hour movie, or a 13-episode series on television and some small variations,"" he says.

""Now, you can do almost anything,"" he adds. ""The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes.""

54,2021-02-25T13:13:37+00:00,"Facebook, Netflix Face Fresh Scrutiny as India Tightens Grip","(Bloomberg) -- India joined the global regulatory push to rein in Silicon Valley technology giants, tightening rules that govern how social media and streaming companies do business in the world’s biggest democracy.

The new rules that come into immediate effect will require the likes of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. to take down unlawful content quicker, Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in an online briefing Thursday. Messaging apps can be asked to provide the identity of the originators of unlawful messages on their platforms, Prasad said, implying the likes of Whatsapp may have to break the encryption and dilute users’ privacy safeguards.

Streaming services such as Netflix Inc., Google’s YouTube and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video face stricter oversight over content containing sexually explicit scenes, violence and abusive language, according to the new rules.

Already under scrutiny from Australia and Europe to their home turf of the U.S., the tech giants can now add their most important emerging market to the list of countries whose regulators are paying closer attention. Policy changes have the potential to slow down the companies in a market that’s already the largest for some of them in terms of the number of users.

‘Take Control’

“Governments everywhere are trying to take control of the free flow of information and not relinquish it to any one social or technology company,” said Ashutosh Sharma, research director at Forrester Research Inc. “We’re moving towards a world where social media will be regulated in some form or the other.”

“The details of rules like these matter and we will carefully study the new rules that were just published,” a Facebook India spokeswoman said in an emailed response. “Facebook is committed to people’s ability to freely and safely express themselves on our platforms.

Local representatives of Whatsapp, Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ Hotstar didn’t immediately comment on the new regulations.

Large social media platforms will need to appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person, a grievance officer, all of them resident in India, according to Prasad, India’s minister of electronics and information technology. “Platforms will be required to give monthly compliance reports,” he said, and companies have three months to ahere to the new rules.

Story continues

Increased Censorship

The new rules replace a previous code from 2011. Draft versions that have been circulating recently have attracted criticism from freedom-of-speech activists and technology trade groups concerned the rules will result in increased censorship and reduced user privacy.

“The Rules could undermine the principles of open and accessible internet,” New Delhi-based Software Freedom Law Center said in an emailed comment. The “traceability provision” will undermine the end-to-end encryption services offered by instant messaging platforms as well as the privacy of private communication, it said.

India’s fast-growing digital economy is headed toward 1 billion users by 2025, prompting the deep-pocketed corporations to battle for market share in everything from online retail and digital payments to messaging and streaming.

Facebook’s namesake social network is used by 410 million people in India and its WhatsApp messaging service by 530 million, said Prasad, while YouTube has 448 million users, Instagram 210 million and Twitter 17.5 million.

Besides the global giants, the new rules -- called Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code -- are set to affect a swath of Indian startups. Beyond streaming and messaging, the code will also set guidelines for digital publishers of news and current-affairs content.

The social media platforms were becoming increasing rife with fake news and were being used to hurt religious sentiments, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement after the media conference.“Over the years, the increasing instances of misuse of social media by criminals, anti-national elements have brought new challenges for law enforcement agencies,” the ministry said. “ These include inducement for recruitment of terrorists, circulation of obscene content, spread of disharmony, financial frauds, incitement of violence, public order etc.”

The new guidelines follow the Indian government’s dispute with Twitter over allegedly inflammatory tweets supporting farmer protests, with the messaging service refusing to comply with certain blocking orders. Meanwhile, an Amazon Prime Video original series “Tandav” was ordered by authorities to be re-edited following protests over its depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses.

The new rules “have the potential to fundamentally change how the internet is accessed and used by millions of users across India,” India-based digital liberties campaigner, Internet Freedom Foundation said on its website. Any attempts to weaken encryption would “undermine the privacy and security of all users,” it said.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: To build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with and thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena. And my thought process was at the time, it was a $30 billion industry, give or take.

Just the film side, it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size. There were a lot of the German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures.

And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem-- use the global distribution that after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me.

Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend. And sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out-- was pretty darn good. And-- but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I always used to say I wasn't joking. I just say, can we get your catering order right? Like how do we-- Their film is a collaborative process. And you make a movie, or you're about to make a movie. And the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes.

Story continues

And with Chris, I'm not kidding. We would just say thank you so much for-- we're very glad that we're financing your movie. And we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. And it was evident very early ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie. And he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since? I mean, you look at what-- the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID. And maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation?

THOMAS TULL: So a couple of things. I think COVID is impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. One of the reasons that I thought it was the right time at least for me to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business and you look at the way-- making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid and secondary windows and so forth-- all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right? They're based on completely different metrics that are media companies is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for, Oh, I guess they did, because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw-dropping.

I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones."" Or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon. They're compelling, right? They're big cinematic experiences.

Now, as someone that as a fan loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope I think is important. I love doing that growing up. And I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen.

But I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, and, of course, that home entertainment gets better and better and better. And movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX. And some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room much accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you have thousands of venues, right? What that coordination-- what that bill-- what that looks like-- it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now and what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable. And we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters, like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters the thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look, the thing that to me is compelling and amazing is, used to be something was a two-ish-hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television. And some small variations now, you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes.

But no, I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination. And sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it. I was always in awe. When we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment, it was kind of surreal.

So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers, like besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg-- all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric. And we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: How does one go from running a chain of laundromats to becoming one of the top producers in Hollywood? Just ask Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Entertainment and financier behind many of the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. After a long string of big budget successes like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Jurassic World,"" Tull chose to walk away from the bright lights in search of his next venture.

Now he's got his eyes on the future, using his deep pockets and vast network to invest in areas like next-gen technology and artificial intelligence. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco, as we discuss his experience in the movie business, his ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the one piece of advice that Warren Buffett once shared about investing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Thomas Tull, who is the founder and CEO of holding company Tulco and a member of the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thomas, great to see you.

THOMAS TULL: You too, Andy. Nice to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So why don't we start off by telling us what Tulco is all about.

THOMAS TULL: Well, it's a holding company structure. And the idea was to find companies that are in spaces that are large but traditionally have not had a lot of technical innovation. And then inside the holding company, we had a group, the tech group that we call Labs, and be able to bring that group's wherewithal and skill sets into these companies to not only provide the capital but the expertise to hopefully transform the businesses to make them much more efficient.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: You've had this incredible career arc. You went from laundromats, to taxes, to Legendary Entertainment, and now this. And we're going to get in all that stuff, but what's sort of the common thread here, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Extreme luck, I guess. But, you know, part of it I think is I'm not-- I wouldn't be good at sort of inventing a new thing that never existed before. If I have any skills, I think it's to look at a company, a sector, an ecosystem, and maybe to be able to find ways to make it more efficient hopefully to have some level of pattern recognition to say, well, these are some methodologies or financial, technical, et cetera, that may work to make this more valuable, and then to do your homework and then go into the space and hopefully to come out successfully.

ANDY SERWER: Let's drill down into Tulco a little bit more. What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called FIGS, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And, obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is and the workers that are on the front line each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So, it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

ANDY SERWER: Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure, and Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman who was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group, certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing, hopefully, some business acumen and then the tech side, but it just allows us a lot of flexibility.

We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right. So I can see that it's not private equity, per se, or venture or anything like that. You have permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about a business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and there was a moment-- I don't think he'd mind me sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about, and he stopped me. And he goes, I got to be honest, for years Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

And I kind of laughed. And he said, no. I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations, and, you know, he's incredibly sharp, and it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.

ANDY SERWER: That is a great nugget. I love that, just to avoid the dumb thing is more important than finding this absolute incredibly smart thing, right?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: So getting back to your insurance operation for a minute, Thomas, I notice that Russell Wilson and his wife, Sierra, have joined in that endeavor somehow, correct?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. It's a joint venture with Acrisure on a separate company. It's part of the Acrisure universe, and they're wonderful people. I've been friends with them socially for years, and just absolute stand up people. And I think making sure that this company not only is profitable but is targeted in a way that allows folks to be included in everything that we want to do. And Russell and Sierra great ambassadors for that, and I think it's very important.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us a little bit about AI. You mentioned how important that is. This is an expertise that's core to your business, and how important do you think this is to the economy going forward?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think every corner of our economy over the next decade is going to be touched by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I think that, done well, it's the human machine interface that makes us more efficient, more thoughtful, and allows us to be not wasteful and, again, to find patterns and find ways that we can be smarter about the way that we approach things, or less dumb if you want to use Warren's axiom.

And so I think that if you're applying it in ways that make sense-- because I think there's a lot of, certainly, in talk about big data and how you use big data. That's great, but it has to be actionable. It has to be measurable, and you have to be able to point to it and say, look, we applied artificial intelligence. We applied data science, and here are the results that we got. It's not magic.

It's just, I think, at the confluence of what situations are appropriate and right to apply it. What can be automated? And then from a jobs perspective, how do we make people free up their time, and how do we do things better, and what other jobs can that open up in the economy?

ANDY SERWER: You've gone from sort of these high profile business in Legendary into sort of more of a nuts and bolts part of the economy. Do you miss the glam of Hollywood?

THOMAS TULL: I don't. Look, it was a wonderful experience. I met some amazing people. I enjoyed the storytelling aspect, and now I'm enjoying the chapter I'm in now. So, again, it was a privilege to be a part of and something that I'm proud of, but I am really enjoying what I'm doing right now.

ANDY SERWER: When you think about these businesses that you're in right now, Thomas, do you talk about or think about how they compete with what's going on with similar kinds of businesses in China, and what do you think the United States' policy should be with regard to China?

THOMAS TULL: Well, that's a very big question. I think that it's important to recognize where we can have common ground, and I think it's also important to recognize where I think we have to take a tough stance on what's fair. And I think the time has certainly come on intellectual property and on technology and practices that don't put us on equal footing to really kind of demand that we reach an accord in agreement.

And I'm hopeful that that can happen because I think it's obviously in everybody's best interest, but when you're talking about being competitive globally, I think it's naive and Pollyanna to not think about the ways in which, if you're competing with Chinese companies, they do have some distinct advantages. And so I think you have to take that into account and just recognize that that's the way it is. Like, you can try to wish it away, but that that's not going to help very much.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you were owned by-- when you were at Legendary, you were owned by a Chinese company, Wanda, in the later history of Legendary. What was that like?

THOMAS TULL: Well, after we sold the company to them, I was there for a short amount of time to sort of transition it over. And look, you know, they had plans and goals, and they also owned AMC. So there was some thought process that went into that, definitely different but, you know, they were a big-- are a big company and certainly had theme parks and theaters and things of that nature. So it was definitely a different pivot, but I was only there for a short amount of time after the transaction.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us, though, about building Legendary Entertainment because, boy, that's a pretty unusual thing because most of the studios, obviously, are decades and decades old. So to build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with that thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena, and my thought process was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, give or take. Just the film side it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size.

There were a lot of-- you know, they do German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures. And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem, use their global distribution that, after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me. Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend.

And, you know, sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out was pretty darn good. And, you know, but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But, you know, it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask you about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I was used to saying I wasn't joking. I'd just say, can we get your catering order right? Like, how do we-- you know, film is a collaborative process. And, you know, you make a movie or you're about to make a movie, and the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes. And with Chris, I'm not kidding, we would just say, thank you so much. We're very glad that we're financing your movie, and we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and it was evident very early. ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie, and he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since. I mean, you look, the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID, and maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation.

THOMAS TULL: You know, so a couple of things. I think COVID has impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. You know, one of the reasons that I thought it was the right time, at least for me, to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business, and you look at the way making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid in secondary windows and so forth, all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right-- they're based on completely different metrics than a media companies-- is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

And I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for-- oh, I guess they did, right? Because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw dropping. I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones"", or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon, they're compelling, right?

They're big cinematic experiences. Now, as someone that, as a fan, loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope, I think, is important. I loved doing that growing up, and I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen, but I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. And of course, the home entertainment gets better and better and better, and movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX and some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you know, thousands of venues, right, what that coordination, what that bill, what that looks like, it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now in what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable, and we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters a thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look. The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is used to be something was a two-ish hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television and some small variations. Now you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes, but no. I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination, and sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.

I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment. It was kind of surreal. So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers like, besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg, all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric, and we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.

ANDY SERWER: Let me switch over and ask you about football a little bit, Thomas. How would you assess the recently completed NFL season? One for the ages, no doubt.

THOMAS TULL: I think the league actually did a phenomenal job. If you stop and think about every game was played under less than ideal circumstances, and we had playoffs. We had a Super Bowl. I thought it was a powerful moment when those 7,500 front line health care workers were at the Super Bowl. I thought that was incredibly powerful. You know, the crazy thing about this period of time, and you think about what teachers are going through, you know? Certainly health care workers, normal people trying to figure out and navigate their way through this.

There's no playbook for any of this. So, you know, on one hand, you want to constantly be thinking about what is best, and you have to put the players and the fans and everybody's personal safety must be the guiding light. And at the same time, so many fans, I mean, just personally and then for the league saying, please. Don't take away-- you know, football is important, and that sort of escapism certainly nowhere near as important-- I don't want to be mistaken for saying that football is something that had to go on, but just to provide some level of entertainment and normalcy I thought was important.

And I think the league did a really nice job getting through this, certainly we'll remember it forever, and I really hope we don't have to do it again, and we can return to some level of normalcy. But, you know, I'm glad that we played. Obviously, the end didn't turn out too well for our team, but just to see the games played and see it through I thought was an accomplishment.

ANDY SERWER: Let me pick up on that one point you just made there about next season, though. What do you think the chances are of it being a normal season next fall?

THOMAS TULL: Well, depending on what normal's definition is. Do I think there will be fans? Is it going to be full? I have no idea, but do I think fans will regularly attend? I'm personally optimistic, right? Do I think that perhaps checkpoints and masks might be a part of that equation somewhere? That's not hard to envision. Do I think testing is going to be a part of it, player safety, all those things? Certainly, I do.

I'm rooting for our entire country on the vaccine front to try to get things distributed as quickly as we can, especially to people that need it the most. And, you know, hopefully we can all get back to living. And I think about everything from small business owners who, you know, are trying to make it to the other side of this, which is really the backbone of this country. And, you know, on the other hand, I think what some of the scientists have pulled off in terms of these vaccines, I really think we're going to look back in time and realize what a monumental achievement it is.

I mean, I'm not fluent in biomed, but friends that are that are into deep research who just said, you have no idea what an accomplishment it is at this speed and velocity to pull this off. And so hopefully that gets rolled out, and we can move ahead.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the Steelers, Thomas? How are they looking for next year in your quarterback situation?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. It's all complicated certainly by the fact we just found out what the cap number is going to be. You know, Ben has been-- he's somebody I'm close to, but he's also one of the greatest Steelers of all time. He's won a couple of Super Bowls, and hopefully everything can be worked out. But at the same time, I think that just this whole year just had a lot of uniqueness to it, but I'm hopeful that it can work out.

He certainly is going to go down on the Mount Rushmore of Steeler players, and so I know that they're talking-- Mr. Rooney, our principal owner, and Kevin Colbert and Coach Tomlin and, you know, they always do a good job. So we'll see what happens.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of Coach Tomlin, the NFL only has three black coaches. What's wrong here, and how do you fix that?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. I had the privilege of being close to Mr. Rooney, Mr. Dan Rooney, who the Rooney Rule is named for. I cannot express what a fine human being he was. I miss him dearly. And recently, his wife had passed away, just the classiest people you ever want to know, and it was so important to him. And I think that we have to-- it's great that we have an interview process, but I think we have to be able to do more.

And I think part of that is what sort of other support can we provide, and I know we have some amazing coaches. There are candidates I'd certainly like to see have head coach, maybe not in our division because they're incredibly talented, but I think it's something that you have to constantly weigh and measure and not just say, hey, we put a rule in place. You know, you're doing the best that you can.

Well, if it's not working, what else can we do to keep progressing forward and make sure that we're doing that? I mean, one of the most profound experiences of my life, to go back to the movie thing, but I had the absolute pleasure of-- we made the movie ""42"" about Jackie Robinson. And certainly, that experience frames a lot of my thinking. And, you know, the opportunity that we all get a real shot, right? And, you know, are weighed on the merits, but that we have justice, and we're treated the same before the law, and that we have an opportunity.

If we have the skills, then we should be able to fill those spots. And I think we have a lot of work to go because we're not there yet. So I think we just have to constantly ask ourselves, what's working, what isn't working, and what can we tweak to make sure that this is dynamic and is ever changing to rise to the challenge?

ANDY SERWER: Let me go from football to baseball. Curt Schilling asked to be removed from the ballot for the Hall of Fame. You sit on the Hall of Fame board and will make the decision on it. Should he stay on the ballot or be removed, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: You know, these are just incredibly unique times. I know that we're going to be briefed on the situation. You know, I'd love to know really what the thinking is, but look, on the other hand, if a player says, I don't want to be associated or considered with the Hall of Fame, which I think is a privilege, then I'm not sure that player should be considered.

I mean, you have to take each individual case, and I certainly want to learn more. But to me, what would be ideal is to have the Hall of Fame be sort of away from politics and away from things of that nature and just say, hey, it's here to celebrate the game of baseball and certainly the right conduct and all those other things, but you just hate to see things get twisted up is all.

ANDY SERWER: You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking about whether anyone had ever turned down an induction. People have turned down Oscars before.

THOMAS TULL: Mm-hm.

ANDY SERWER: Right? Just putting that out there. It's interesting.

THOMAS TULL: Sure.

ANDY SERWER: It's part of the thinking.

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. That's one of the things just overall that I think is great about this country and the freedom it affords is that I don't have to agree with everything that you say, and hopefully we're able in a civil way to exchange ideas and not be afraid to exchange ideas in a civil tone. And, you know, hopefully we can progress to that place.

ANDY SERWER: You grew up in a low income family raised by a single mom in upstate New York, earned an athletic scholarship to a NESCAC school-- got to get a NESCAC pitch in there-- Hamilton College.

THOMAS TULL: Yup.

ANDY SERWER: I'm a NESCAC guy, too. Launched laundromats, as I mentioned, after graduation. So how did that early life experience shape you, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think knowing what it feels like to truly-- you know, there's not another euphemism. We were poor. I mean, if you know what it's like to go to bed hungry or have the lights turned off, you know, it has an impact. And I also looked at my mother who's a dental hygienist and she worked two jobs, and I watched her do that and do whatever was necessary, and just day after day.

And that's, I think thematically for me, that there are heroes that do amazing things in the moment they're called upon. I'm also always impressed with people that answer the bell every day, right, that are doing things when no one's looking and there's no extra credit, right? It's not on Instagram. It's just, hey, I'm getting up and I'm doing what I need to do, and I think that's heroic in itself. You know, my grandmother, her mother was a hospital cleaning lady, which is one of the toughest jobs that I can think of.

And so I just think, from a young age, understanding that you better have resiliency and that, whether you like it or not, whatever the circumstances are, that's what you have to deal with. So, you know, any of that certainly comes from them and from the experiences I had. And then the other side of it, anybody who gets anywhere, I think, has to make peace with the fact that there is absolutely luck involved because things could go inch to the left, inch to the right, and your life is completely different.

And I try to really keep that in mind that if you start to think, jeez, I'm in a different place and pretty special, you better keep that thinking at bay because I think that it's not correct, and it's dangerous thinking.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, Thomas, have you thought about what you'd like your legacy to be?

THOMAS TULL: Look, I feel like every single day I get to live a life that I couldn't even imagine. So I think, hopefully, my number one thing is I've got two 11-year-old twin boys that are at the center of my world, and being a good father is a very big deal to me. And I'd also say just that, you know, doing the things that I have the reach or impact to be able to do to help because I think, in our country citizenship, is something that you have to work at it. You have an obligation to be informed.

And if you have the opportunity through philanthropically or some way to help to be impactful in your community, you have to do those things. And so I just hope that-- you have to earn that every single day. And so I think a lot about that and, you know, but I'm in a place that I'm still trying to earn that rather than thinking about what it is. So hopefully we can keep it going.

ANDY SERWER: Sounds good. Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco. Thank you so much for your time.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: How does one go from running a chain of laundromats to becoming one of the top producers in Hollywood? Just ask Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Entertainment and financier behind many of the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. After a long string of big budget successes like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Jurassic World,"" Tull chose to walk away from the bright lights in search of his next venture.

Now he's got his eyes on the future, using his deep pockets and vast network to invest in areas like next-gen technology and artificial intelligence. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco, as we discuss his experience in the movie business, his ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the one piece of advice that Warren Buffett once shared about investing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Thomas Tull, who is the founder and CEO of holding company Tulco and a member of the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thomas, great to see you.

THOMAS TULL: You too, Andy. Nice to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So why don't we start off by telling us what Tulco is all about.

THOMAS TULL: Well, it's a holding company structure. And the idea was to find companies that are in spaces that are large but traditionally have not had a lot of technical innovation. And then inside the holding company, we had a group, the tech group that we call Labs, and be able to bring that group's wherewithal and skill sets into these companies to not only provide the capital but the expertise to hopefully transform the businesses to make them much more efficient.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: You've had this incredible career arc. You went from laundromats, to taxes, to Legendary Entertainment, and now this. And we're going to get in all that stuff, but what's sort of the common thread here, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Extreme luck, I guess. But, you know, part of it I think is I'm not-- I wouldn't be good at sort of inventing a new thing that never existed before. If I have any skills, I think it's to look at a company, a sector, an ecosystem, and maybe to be able to find ways to make it more efficient hopefully to have some level of pattern recognition to say, well, these are some methodologies or financial, technical, et cetera, that may work to make this more valuable, and then to do your homework and then go into the space and hopefully to come out successfully.

ANDY SERWER: Let's drill down into Tulco a little bit more. What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called FIGS, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And, obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is and the workers that are on the front line each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So, it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

ANDY SERWER: Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure, and Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman who was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group, certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing, hopefully, some business acumen and then the tech side, but it just allows us a lot of flexibility.

We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right. So I can see that it's not private equity, per se, or venture or anything like that. You have permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about a business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and there was a moment-- I don't think he'd mind me sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about, and he stopped me. And he goes, I got to be honest, for years Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

And I kind of laughed. And he said, no. I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations, and, you know, he's incredibly sharp, and it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.

ANDY SERWER: That is a great nugget. I love that, just to avoid the dumb thing is more important than finding this absolute incredibly smart thing, right?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: So getting back to your insurance operation for a minute, Thomas, I notice that Russell Wilson and his wife, Sierra, have joined in that endeavor somehow, correct?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. It's a joint venture with Acrisure on a separate company. It's part of the Acrisure universe, and they're wonderful people. I've been friends with them socially for years, and just absolute stand up people. And I think making sure that this company not only is profitable but is targeted in a way that allows folks to be included in everything that we want to do. And Russell and Sierra great ambassadors for that, and I think it's very important.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us a little bit about AI. You mentioned how important that is. This is an expertise that's core to your business, and how important do you think this is to the economy going forward?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think every corner of our economy over the next decade is going to be touched by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I think that, done well, it's the human machine interface that makes us more efficient, more thoughtful, and allows us to be not wasteful and, again, to find patterns and find ways that we can be smarter about the way that we approach things, or less dumb if you want to use Warren's axiom.

And so I think that if you're applying it in ways that make sense-- because I think there's a lot of, certainly, in talk about big data and how you use big data. That's great, but it has to be actionable. It has to be measurable, and you have to be able to point to it and say, look, we applied artificial intelligence. We applied data science, and here are the results that we got. It's not magic.

It's just, I think, at the confluence of what situations are appropriate and right to apply it. What can be automated? And then from a jobs perspective, how do we make people free up their time, and how do we do things better, and what other jobs can that open up in the economy?

ANDY SERWER: You've gone from sort of these high profile business in Legendary into sort of more of a nuts and bolts part of the economy. Do you miss the glam of Hollywood?

THOMAS TULL: I don't. Look, it was a wonderful experience. I met some amazing people. I enjoyed the storytelling aspect, and now I'm enjoying the chapter I'm in now. So, again, it was a privilege to be a part of and something that I'm proud of, but I am really enjoying what I'm doing right now.

ANDY SERWER: When you think about these businesses that you're in right now, Thomas, do you talk about or think about how they compete with what's going on with similar kinds of businesses in China, and what do you think the United States' policy should be with regard to China?

THOMAS TULL: Well, that's a very big question. I think that it's important to recognize where we can have common ground, and I think it's also important to recognize where I think we have to take a tough stance on what's fair. And I think the time has certainly come on intellectual property and on technology and practices that don't put us on equal footing to really kind of demand that we reach an accord in agreement.

And I'm hopeful that that can happen because I think it's obviously in everybody's best interest, but when you're talking about being competitive globally, I think it's naive and Pollyanna to not think about the ways in which, if you're competing with Chinese companies, they do have some distinct advantages. And so I think you have to take that into account and just recognize that that's the way it is. Like, you can try to wish it away, but that that's not going to help very much.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you were owned by-- when you were at Legendary, you were owned by a Chinese company, Wanda, in the later history of Legendary. What was that like?

THOMAS TULL: Well, after we sold the company to them, I was there for a short amount of time to sort of transition it over. And look, you know, they had plans and goals, and they also owned AMC. So there was some thought process that went into that, definitely different but, you know, they were a big-- are a big company and certainly had theme parks and theaters and things of that nature. So it was definitely a different pivot, but I was only there for a short amount of time after the transaction.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us, though, about building Legendary Entertainment because, boy, that's a pretty unusual thing because most of the studios, obviously, are decades and decades old. So to build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with that thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena, and my thought process was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, give or take. Just the film side it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size.

There were a lot of-- you know, they do German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures. And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem, use their global distribution that, after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me. Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend.

And, you know, sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out was pretty darn good. And, you know, but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But, you know, it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask you about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I was used to saying I wasn't joking. I'd just say, can we get your catering order right? Like, how do we-- you know, film is a collaborative process. And, you know, you make a movie or you're about to make a movie, and the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes. And with Chris, I'm not kidding, we would just say, thank you so much. We're very glad that we're financing your movie, and we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and it was evident very early. ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie, and he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since. I mean, you look, the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID, and maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation.

THOMAS TULL: You know, so a couple of things. I think COVID has impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. You know, one of the reasons that I thought it was the right time, at least for me, to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business, and you look at the way making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid in secondary windows and so forth, all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right-- they're based on completely different metrics than a media companies-- is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

And I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for-- oh, I guess they did, right? Because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw dropping. I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones"", or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon, they're compelling, right?

They're big cinematic experiences. Now, as someone that, as a fan, loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope, I think, is important. I loved doing that growing up, and I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen, but I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. And of course, the home entertainment gets better and better and better, and movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX and some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you know, thousands of venues, right, what that coordination, what that bill, what that looks like, it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now in what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable, and we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters a thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look. The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is used to be something was a two-ish hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television and some small variations. Now you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes, but no. I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination, and sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.

I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment. It was kind of surreal. So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers like, besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg, all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric, and we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.

ANDY SERWER: Let me switch over and ask you about football a little bit, Thomas. How would you assess the recently completed NFL season? One for the ages, no doubt.

THOMAS TULL: I think the league actually did a phenomenal job. If you stop and think about every game was played under less than ideal circumstances, and we had playoffs. We had a Super Bowl. I thought it was a powerful moment when those 7,500 front line health care workers were at the Super Bowl. I thought that was incredibly powerful. You know, the crazy thing about this period of time, and you think about what teachers are going through, you know? Certainly health care workers, normal people trying to figure out and navigate their way through this.

There's no playbook for any of this. So, you know, on one hand, you want to constantly be thinking about what is best, and you have to put the players and the fans and everybody's personal safety must be the guiding light. And at the same time, so many fans, I mean, just personally and then for the league saying, please. Don't take away-- you know, football is important, and that sort of escapism certainly nowhere near as important-- I don't want to be mistaken for saying that football is something that had to go on, but just to provide some level of entertainment and normalcy I thought was important.

And I think the league did a really nice job getting through this, certainly we'll remember it forever, and I really hope we don't have to do it again, and we can return to some level of normalcy. But, you know, I'm glad that we played. Obviously, the end didn't turn out too well for our team, but just to see the games played and see it through I thought was an accomplishment.

ANDY SERWER: Let me pick up on that one point you just made there about next season, though. What do you think the chances are of it being a normal season next fall?

THOMAS TULL: Well, depending on what normal's definition is. Do I think there will be fans? Is it going to be full? I have no idea, but do I think fans will regularly attend? I'm personally optimistic, right? Do I think that perhaps checkpoints and masks might be a part of that equation somewhere? That's not hard to envision. Do I think testing is going to be a part of it, player safety, all those things? Certainly, I do.

I'm rooting for our entire country on the vaccine front to try to get things distributed as quickly as we can, especially to people that need it the most. And, you know, hopefully we can all get back to living. And I think about everything from small business owners who, you know, are trying to make it to the other side of this, which is really the backbone of this country. And, you know, on the other hand, I think what some of the scientists have pulled off in terms of these vaccines, I really think we're going to look back in time and realize what a monumental achievement it is.

I mean, I'm not fluent in biomed, but friends that are that are into deep research who just said, you have no idea what an accomplishment it is at this speed and velocity to pull this off. And so hopefully that gets rolled out, and we can move ahead.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the Steelers, Thomas? How are they looking for next year in your quarterback situation?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. It's all complicated certainly by the fact we just found out what the cap number is going to be. You know, Ben has been-- he's somebody I'm close to, but he's also one of the greatest Steelers of all time. He's won a couple of Super Bowls, and hopefully everything can be worked out. But at the same time, I think that just this whole year just had a lot of uniqueness to it, but I'm hopeful that it can work out.

He certainly is going to go down on the Mount Rushmore of Steeler players, and so I know that they're talking-- Mr. Rooney, our principal owner, and Kevin Colbert and Coach Tomlin and, you know, they always do a good job. So we'll see what happens.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of Coach Tomlin, the NFL only has three black coaches. What's wrong here, and how do you fix that?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. I had the privilege of being close to Mr. Rooney, Mr. Dan Rooney, who the Rooney Rule is named for. I cannot express what a fine human being he was. I miss him dearly. And recently, his wife had passed away, just the classiest people you ever want to know, and it was so important to him. And I think that we have to-- it's great that we have an interview process, but I think we have to be able to do more.

And I think part of that is what sort of other support can we provide, and I know we have some amazing coaches. There are candidates I'd certainly like to see have head coach, maybe not in our division because they're incredibly talented, but I think it's something that you have to constantly weigh and measure and not just say, hey, we put a rule in place. You know, you're doing the best that you can.

Well, if it's not working, what else can we do to keep progressing forward and make sure that we're doing that? I mean, one of the most profound experiences of my life, to go back to the movie thing, but I had the absolute pleasure of-- we made the movie ""42"" about Jackie Robinson. And certainly, that experience frames a lot of my thinking. And, you know, the opportunity that we all get a real shot, right? And, you know, are weighed on the merits, but that we have justice, and we're treated the same before the law, and that we have an opportunity.

If we have the skills, then we should be able to fill those spots. And I think we have a lot of work to go because we're not there yet. So I think we just have to constantly ask ourselves, what's working, what isn't working, and what can we tweak to make sure that this is dynamic and is ever changing to rise to the challenge?

ANDY SERWER: Let me go from football to baseball. Curt Schilling asked to be removed from the ballot for the Hall of Fame. You sit on the Hall of Fame board and will make the decision on it. Should he stay on the ballot or be removed, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: You know, these are just incredibly unique times. I know that we're going to be briefed on the situation. You know, I'd love to know really what the thinking is, but look, on the other hand, if a player says, I don't want to be associated or considered with the Hall of Fame, which I think is a privilege, then I'm not sure that player should be considered.

I mean, you have to take each individual case, and I certainly want to learn more. But to me, what would be ideal is to have the Hall of Fame be sort of away from politics and away from things of that nature and just say, hey, it's here to celebrate the game of baseball and certainly the right conduct and all those other things, but you just hate to see things get twisted up is all.

ANDY SERWER: You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking about whether anyone had ever turned down an induction. People have turned down Oscars before.

THOMAS TULL: Mm-hm.

ANDY SERWER: Right? Just putting that out there. It's interesting.

THOMAS TULL: Sure.

ANDY SERWER: It's part of the thinking.

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. That's one of the things just overall that I think is great about this country and the freedom it affords is that I don't have to agree with everything that you say, and hopefully we're able in a civil way to exchange ideas and not be afraid to exchange ideas in a civil tone. And, you know, hopefully we can progress to that place.

ANDY SERWER: You grew up in a low income family raised by a single mom in upstate New York, earned an athletic scholarship to a NESCAC school-- got to get a NESCAC pitch in there-- Hamilton College.

THOMAS TULL: Yup.

ANDY SERWER: I'm a NESCAC guy, too. Launched laundromats, as I mentioned, after graduation. So how did that early life experience shape you, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think knowing what it feels like to truly-- you know, there's not another euphemism. We were poor. I mean, if you know what it's like to go to bed hungry or have the lights turned off, you know, it has an impact. And I also looked at my mother who's a dental hygienist and she worked two jobs, and I watched her do that and do whatever was necessary, and just day after day.

And that's, I think thematically for me, that there are heroes that do amazing things in the moment they're called upon. I'm also always impressed with people that answer the bell every day, right, that are doing things when no one's looking and there's no extra credit, right? It's not on Instagram. It's just, hey, I'm getting up and I'm doing what I need to do, and I think that's heroic in itself. You know, my grandmother, her mother was a hospital cleaning lady, which is one of the toughest jobs that I can think of.

And so I just think, from a young age, understanding that you better have resiliency and that, whether you like it or not, whatever the circumstances are, that's what you have to deal with. So, you know, any of that certainly comes from them and from the experiences I had. And then the other side of it, anybody who gets anywhere, I think, has to make peace with the fact that there is absolutely luck involved because things could go inch to the left, inch to the right, and your life is completely different.

And I try to really keep that in mind that if you start to think, jeez, I'm in a different place and pretty special, you better keep that thinking at bay because I think that it's not correct, and it's dangerous thinking.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, Thomas, have you thought about what you'd like your legacy to be?

THOMAS TULL: Look, I feel like every single day I get to live a life that I couldn't even imagine. So I think, hopefully, my number one thing is I've got two 11-year-old twin boys that are at the center of my world, and being a good father is a very big deal to me. And I'd also say just that, you know, doing the things that I have the reach or impact to be able to do to help because I think, in our country citizenship, is something that you have to work at it. You have an obligation to be informed.

And if you have the opportunity through philanthropically or some way to help to be impactful in your community, you have to do those things. And so I just hope that-- you have to earn that every single day. And so I think a lot about that and, you know, but I'm in a place that I'm still trying to earn that rather than thinking about what it is. So hopefully we can keep it going.

ANDY SERWER: Sounds good. Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco. Thank you so much for your time.

THOMAS TULL: Thank you, Andy.

59,2021-02-24T23:47:47+00:00,Nvidia Slips on Concern About Growth of Data Center Business,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares slipped on concern about growth of the company’s data center chip business.

During an earnings conference call, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the majority of growth in the current period will come from Nvidia’s gaming business. Some analysts worried that means the data center division will expand more slowly and they asked several questions on the topic during the call.

Nvidia reported data center chip sales jumped 97% to $1.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. It also gave a revenue forecast that beat Wall Street expectations. However, the CFO’s comments on the conference call curbed enthusiasm for a stock that has more than doubled in the past year.

The stock fell about 2.5% in extended trading, after closing at $579.96 in New York earlier on Wednesday.

The company has become a barometer of confidence at some of the biggest tech companies. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. use Nvidia graphics chips to help power some of the most widely used services on the internet. That business is choppy, with spikes in orders followed by lulls as customers use up stockpiles of chips.

Right now, the semiconductor sector is struggling to meet surging demand in some parts of the industry, and Nvidia has been caught up in this.

An increase in online activity and purchases of technology gear for working from home triggered a sharp rebound in chip demand last year. That caught some customers off guard, especially automakers. New orders flooded in and the global semiconductor supply chain is still trying to catch up. Nvidia outsources production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., which are swamped with orders. That’s limiting Nvidia’s ability to meet demand.

“Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming,” Kress said.

QuickTake: Here’s Why the World Is Short of Computer Chips.

Story continues

Nvidia is supply constrained “at the company level,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said. It has enough supply to grow throughout this year, and some segments like data center won’t be hurt by chip shortages, he added.

Revenue will be about $5.3 billion in the period ending in April, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $4.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The chipmaker is seeing a surge in orders for PC gaming gear from consumers stuck at home in the pandemic and looking for entertainment. Nvidia’s graphics chips are also important components in machines that run the code needed to create Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months.

Huang has built on Nvidia’s strength in PC gaming graphics chips by taking the company into new markets such as artificial intelligence processing in data centers and components for autonomous vehicles.

Revenue from gaming was $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 67% from the same period last year.During previous run ups in the price of cryptocurrencies, Nvidia experienced surging demand followed by crashes sparked by price drops and the switch to more customized technology. The company has tried to minimize this volatility by offering different chips specifically for crypto mining. That reduces the risk that Nvidia’s gaming chips are dumped back into the market when crypto customers realized they don’t need them.

Last September, Nvidia agreed to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, in a bid to control of some of the most widely used electronics technology. The two are seeking regulatory approval around the world. Arm customers including Google, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are worried about the deal and have urged antitrust officials to intervene.

Fiscal fourth quarter revenue rose 61% to $5 billion and profit excluding certain costs was $3.10 a share in the period, which ended Jan. 31, the company said. Analysts, on average, predicted earnings of $2.81 a share on sales of $4.82 billion.

Everyone is coming for Tesla's crown

Tesla (TSLA) is synonymous with electric vehicles, but a new generation of EV automakers inspired by CEO Elon Musk’s electrified empire may be coming after its crown.

Lucid Motors, which is headed by former Tesla engineer Peter Rawlinson and promises better performance than Tesla, announced on Monday its plans to go public. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN)-backed Rivian, which is also planning an IPO this year, is taking on Tesla in the truck space. Traditional automakers like Ford (F) and Volkswagen also pose a threat to the world leader in EV sales. And then there’s potentially Tesla’s biggest eventual rival: Apple and its own EV ambitions.

Tesla clawed its way to the top of the EV market through the sheer will of outspoken, and often mercurial, CEO Elon Musk. And while, as of Tuesday, Tesla’s stock price dropped as much as 18% in the last month following its $1.5 billion bitcoin bet, the company is still up 319% in the last 12 months.

But it’s going to need much more than a charismatic leader and rabid fan base to maintain its lead in the coming years. According to Deloitte Insights, EVs will make up 32% of new car sales by 2030, up from just over 2.5% in 2020 — meaning there’s plenty of space for competitors.

“Tesla has lots...of competition,” Craig Irwin of Roth Capital Partners told Yahoo Finance. “There are companies that have superior technology in autonomous, there are companies that have superior technology in batteries, there are companies that have superior technology in electric vehicles. Tesla has great cars, don't get me wrong, but you're going to see a number of very exciting developments over the course of the next year.”

So how can Tesla hold onto its lead? By continuing to press its global expansion into India, and ensuring its secret sauce — its technical prowess — stays ahead of its rivals. But the increasingly crowded market for EV vehicles could throw some obstacles in Tesla’s path.

How Tesla can hold its lead

For Tesla, global expansion is the easiest way to keep pace with the new crop of competitors, and it’s made progress on that front. The company has already rolled out its vehicles and built a plant in China, and is in the midst of constructing its first European plant in Germany.

Tesla also has the advantage of understanding the difficulties of bringing its own manufacturing capabilities online. The company went through what Musk called “production Hell” when getting its Model 3 assembly line up and running in 2018. The firm was just weeks from going under during the build up, and in a recent tweet Musk revealed that during the buildout he tried getting in touch with Apple CEO Tim Cook to sell the automaker.

While Tesla’s move into China was crucial because the country has the world’s largest car market, its next move into India, also one of the world’s largest markets, will be nearly as important for the company’s continued growth.

“The key development this year is the start of sales into India,” Irwin noted, adding that he’s heard “chatter” that Tesla has already selected a site for the Indian factory. Lucid's Air Dream is the automaker's top-of-the-line vehicle, and, according to the company, outclasses Tesla's Model S in terms of range. (Image: Lucid)

Tesla, which was down just over 2% as of market close Tuesday, also needs to ensure it doesn’t get caught up in its recent move into bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company put $1.5 billion of its cash into the cryptocurrency, helping to send bitcoin soaring even higher. And while it saw roughly $1 billion in profits on paper, Musk’s subsequent statements on the cryptocurrency may have helped send its price down.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, however, warns that Tesla’s crypto play shouldn’t distract investors from the company’s overall efforts.

“This is a golden age of EVs and we forecast that $5 trillion will be spent over the next decade,” Ives told Yahoo Finance. “EV, led by Tesla, is changing the way investors value these companies going forward. It’s not your grandfather’s auto industry anymore, as Detroit is showing on EVs.”

Besides, there are plenty of other companies taking aim at Tesla in the meantime.

Tesla’s coming competition

Lucid Motors revealed Monday it was going public via a reverse merger with special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, Churchill Capital IV (CCIV). The deal values Lucid at a whopping $24 billion and will provide the upstart automaker with $4.4 billion to expand its Arizona-based plant.

Lucid aims to get its high-end luxury sedan, the Lucid Air, on the road this year, and eventually have the Arizona plant pumping out as many as 365,000 units a year. The company is also working on production of its luxury SUV, the Lucid Gravity, which is set to launch in 2023.

The Lucid Air Dream is Lucid’s top-of-the-line model priced at $161,500, well above the $119,900 Tesla Model S Plaid. “Our first product is unashamedly a luxury car that will compete with the Mercedes Benz S-Class at the top table,” CEO Peter Rawlinson told Yahoo Finance Live Monday. “And currently there isn’t an EV offering in the true luxury arena.”

What makes Lucid so impressive is that, according to its own number, it already outclasses Tesla in terms of battery performance. With an estimated range of 503 miles per charge, the Dream’s battery can also be charged to 300 miles in just 20 minutes. Tesla’s long-range Model S, meanwhile, gets just 412 miles on a charge, and can be charged with up to only 200 miles of power in 15 minutes. R.J.

Lucid is not the only competitor coming after Tesla, of course. Rivian is also set to launch its long-awaited electric truck this year, with backing from heavyweights including Amazon, which is preparing a fleet of Rivian-based electric delivery vehicles. Rivian also has the backing of Ford, which will use Rivian technology in its own offerings. The company promises more than 300 miles of range in its R1T truck with a starting price of $67,500.

Rivian is also expected to IPO this year at an estimated valuation of $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. That company is powering out of the gate with an electric truck, setting up stiff competition for Tesla’s upcoming Cybertruck, which is also launching this year.

Tesla has even managed to inspire an electric truck company fittingly called Nikola (NKLA) — Tesla is named after the inventor Nikola Tesla — though that firm was blasted in a report from short seller Hindenburg accusing it of being a fraud. (Nikola denied the report and called it a “hit job.”)

Traditional automakers entering the space include Ford, which will launch its highly anticipated Mustang Mach-E crossover in the coming months at a starting price of $42,895 and upwards of 250 miles per charge. Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategies says that Volkswagen could become a Tesla rival, too, noting that a large automaker could, in a few years, become the No. 2 EV automaker after Musk’s company.

Then there’s Apple, which is rumored to be teaming up with an established automaker like Hyundai, on an electric vehicle of its own. Still, details on how Apple will actually manufacture the car are scant, and it isn’t expected to hit the market until 2024.

But Apple is just one part of the bigger picture, which is this: The EV field is becoming crowded. Tesla may have the best-selling EV of all time, by a wide margin, as my colleague Rick Newman pointed out, but the flurry of new competitors may expose its weak points.

Those flaws include an unpredictable CEO who was sued by the SEC over a tweet saying he had funding to take Tesla private, as well as fatal car crashes that have invited scrutiny into its autopilot system. Tesla may still be the EV leader despite these flaws — but now is not the time for Elon Musk to take his empire for granted.

64,2021-02-24T16:26:28+00:00,2021 Is Shaping Up To Be A Pivotal Year For EVs,"Online car shopping site Edmunds predicts 2021 will be a ""pivotal year"" for EVs with U.S. sales rising to 2.5% versus 1.9% last year and many new models entering the market in the next 11 months. According to Edmunds, consumers are in for 30 EVs from 21 brands, up from 17 models in 2020.

Already, automakers are redefining their images and products. German luxury automaker Audi that is owned by Volkswagen Group (OTC: VWAGY) recently introduced its 2022 e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT, two high-performance electric cars.

Besides Volkswagen's compact ID.4 promises to be a serious challenger to the top-selling Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3, here are a few legendary automakers are charging up their portfolios and betting big on EVs as they are determined to make Tesla a run for its money.

The British Jaguar

Tata Motors Limited (NYSE: TM)-owned Jaguar Land Rover has become the latest manufacturer to commit to an electric future. The British sports car maker known for its seductive designs announced on February 15th it plans to become an ""all-electric luxury brand"" by 2025. Jaguar currently manufactures one EV, the I-PACE. Last year's global sales of the stylish and futuristic-looking SUV amounted to 7,807 units. Its first all-electric Land Rover model is scheduled for 2024 followed by five pure electric variants in the next five years.

Ford Motor

The Dearborn 117-year old automaker's new, splashy Mustang Mach-E SUV has Tesla owners trading in their vehicles for this all-electric Ford. The company's next vehicle launch with a battery-electric drivetrain will likely be the F-150 pickup in early 2022. Ford's rollout of battery-powered vehicles in the U.S. has been slow compared to the competition but its European lineup will run solely on batteries by 2030.

Ford pledged to spend $1 billion to electrify its factory in Cologne, Germany, which has been the home of its operations for nearly a century as part of doubling its investment in electric vehicles to $22 billion by the end of 2025. Two-thirds of Ford's commercial vehicle sales expected to be all-electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030 and Ford's newly announced partnership with Volkswagen will help the company achieve its EV targets. The Cologne facility, the home of its operations in Germany for 90 years, recently

General Motors

The auto giant has not done away with internal combustion engines but it plans to do so by vowing that 40% of U.S. models will be EVs by the end of 2025, reaching a majority by 2035. General Motors' (NYSE: GM) large, masculine pickup trucks have been reliable moneymakers for the company and consumer demand for these gas-guzzlers skyrocketed in the spring and summer. The rebirth of GM's Hummer in an all-electric version has been scheduled for 2022. Interest in the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq has been sparked with its entertaining Super Bowl ads. GM's small, Bolt hatchback got a redesign and a sibling, the Bolt EUV, an electric utility vehicle scheduled for 2022. Global sales of the Bolt EV have topped 100,000 since its market launch in 2017. All these models are merely a part of GM's strategy to launch 30 new EVs across the globe by 2025.

Bentley Motors

The formidable, mighty W12 and V8 engines that power the ultra-luxury automaker's pricey sedans, grand tourers and SUVs will soon become automotive legend. Back in November, Bentley announced the debut of its first electric vehicle is scheduled for 2025. By 2030, every assembly that comes out of its Crewe, U.K., factory will be battery electric.

Pickups

2021 will be the year in which the world will get its first electric pickup. All-electric automaker Rivian that has been backed by Ford and supported by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been testing its $67,500 R1T truck in Arizona's desert; the truck can get 300+ miles of range on a full charge. Then there's the Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ: RIDE) Endurance, which will compete in the grueling desert race this April in Baja, California.

Worksport addresses the anxiety around EVs

Worksport (OTC: WKSP), a producer of innovative yet affordable tonneau covers for pickups, has partnered with Atlis Motor Vehicles and Hercules Electric Vehicles to configure its TerraVis system for their upcoming pickups. TerraVis can be used beyond pickup trucks such as for powering a job site, campsite or in an emergency.

Outlook

A larger selection of EVs at affordable prices may help increase the adoption of emissions-free vehicles. Brace yourself for an electric automotive future as even the legendary automakers are transforming their businesses.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: Let's stay on the economy and talk a bit more about everything happening in the markets. We're joined now by Kristen Bitterly. She is the regional head of investments for North America at Citi Private Bank. Kristen, thanks for joining the program this morning. I'd love to start with rates and what you guys are thinking about the signal we can reliably say is coming from the long end of the bond market and how you're trying to decompose some of those pressures that maybe have investors worried or maybe folks are just looking through.

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so the price action that we've seen obviously in broader markets and particularly within rates, this has been driving everything over the past couple of days. And this question about, OK, should we be worried about inflation, the curve steepening, what does that mean for growth stocks? And so in terms of how we've been positioned going into this, we've actually been pulling back from some of what we call the COVID defensive stocks that have really seen a run over the past 12 months and then rotating into what we call COVID cyclicals. So we've been doing that rotation. And we've also been positioning our portfolios in anticipation of some of this inflationary concern as well as rising rates.

Because as the data gets better-- So some of the things you were just talking about. So the consumer savings rate, the average savings rate in the US is twice the amount it was last year. As we think about this pent-up demand and when that actually, when the 15% of the global economy that's currently shut down, when that actually comes back online, what does that mean? So looking at our portfolios, basically, if you're looking at this curve steepening, what things are punitive? It's cash and duration.

Story continues

So where we're positioned right now is we're trying to find ways of augmenting income without taking on duration. And we're actually trying to convince people that cash is punitive. Because when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis, you're almost guaranteed to lose value.

- Well, seeing that people have seemingly been pouring money into lots of stuff that has a higher return, maybe they're getting that message that cash is punitive right now. I want to pick up on the discussion we were just having about consumer confidence. I don't know where in the world you are. But this sort of perception that maybe we're a little skewed here in the Northeast in terms of how open the economy is. Both anecdotally and the actual data, how optimistic are you in terms of economic growth right now?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: So I'm in the Northeast as well. So in terms of-- I'm here in Brooklyn. So in terms of my own perception of it, I can say that I definitely feel that that 15% of the global economy is still definitely shut down where it may be more open depending upon climate. I think that consumer confidence, we still see-- so, yes, there's certain parts of the market where people are pouring money into the market. And we've seen that. But we also do see that hesitancy in terms of getting invested. And so I can understand that consumer confidence kind of being right in the middle, that there is improving data, right? So you have this element of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines.

You also have more-- more vaccines coming to market, right, and more efficacious treatment. So this idea that you could see a summer that would be a little bit more normal I think is something that, that consumers are getting comfortable with. And they are starting to think about planning things like vacations and how basically they're going to be coming back to normal in a post-pandemic world. But we've seen spending-- so you guys were mentioning kind of the spending in terms of home improvements and the first time someone bought a drill.

We've seen that type of spending. But, obviously, there still is this pent-up demand. And there still is a pent up demand for all of those really heavy-hit COVID cyclical industries, which is something that will drive the consumer behavior, and I think ultimately something that will be a reinforcement of whether we actually see strong consumer confidence.

- Kristen, is too much being made out of the rise in 10-year yields? It's not as if the 10-year is at 4%. It's at 1.4%, remains very low historically. Are you at that point where 1.4% is triggering you to make changes in your portfolios?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: You know what I think the market is wrestling with right now? So when we look at the 10-year where it's at, we almost have to go back and say, look, the 10-year in December of 2019 was at 1.9%. So the economy was functioning very, very well. Technology and growth stocks were actually continuing to dominate the market and grow. And so I think what the market is wrestling with right now is whether this rotation that we're seeing, is it a rotation or is it catch-up of COVID cyclicals? So the price action that we see today, obviously, you're seeing some of that rotation. You're seeing financials perform very well. You're seeing tech hurt a little bit. But I think one of the questions that we're all struggling with is really kind of pivoting more to real earnings as opposed to expectations.

And so what I mean by that is yes, you can see why financials would perform well with the curve steepening. You can see parts of, once the economy reopens, those sectors actually doing particularly well. But I think one question on everyone's mind is so when you look at some of these companies that have been dominating the market-- so let's talk about the big five, right, so like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook-- when you look at them, they're right now around 18% of market cap. But they're 25% of earnings. And so in terms of representation from a contribution of earnings standpoint, you can almost make the argument that they're underrepresented. And so I think the focus and what everyone's going to be watching very closely is can these companies actually continue these really stellar earnings and continue to deliver even as we move to a post COVID-world?

MYLES UDLAND: Now Kristen, something you flagged to us is that all your clients or many of your clients are asking about if we're in a bubble. How that fits in here, I think everyone likes talking about it because the big fun word to say. And related to that also is the crypto conversation. All this speculation that happens, not just in financial markets, but tangential to financial markets, how are you guys talking through some of those concerns or maybe the FOMO, perhaps, that the [? senior ?] client base is having if they are not really allocated to those kinds of areas?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so are we-- the question about are we in a bubble and where to put capital to work, I think you always have to put it into perspective. My colleague Robert Buckland did a really great piece, an op-ed piece in the ""Financial Times"" that walked through just putting it into perspective compared to 2000, for example. And if we look at the price action not just over the past-- I think everyone's looking at this price action since March and since the depths of the pandemic. But if we take a step back and we actually look at over the past three years, what price action are we seeing in equity markets? Well, the past three years, you can say the NASDAQ is up 90%. So 30% per annum, that's actually very, very strong. We all would agree with that.

But going into the tech bubble, it was completely different. It was around 300%. US equities up around 36%, so 12% per annum. Once we got outside the US though, it's a very different story. So emerging markets up 12% over that time period, the DAX flat, UK equity is are actually negative over that same time period. So I think the one thing is when you're looking at, are we in a bubble? There are parts of the market that, yes, feel that way, look that way, seem overheated. And that's why I go back to, are they-- are these parts of the market, are they delivering on earnings or not?

And the other thing is to focus on, where haven't you seen some of the snapback? Where are you looking from a relative valuation standpoint that's attractive? And an example of that, global health care. So global health care, you would think in a pandemic, right, in a pandemic, health care would absolutely be rallying. But what we've seen is on a relative PE basis, it's at the lowest levels relative to global equities in about a decade.

So we like health care for a variety of reasons, not just because of the pandemic, but more of a demographic argument. But it's a strong sector, high free cash flow generating. So there's areas of the market where it makes a lot of sense to invest-- not only short term, but long term.

68,2021-02-24T15:43:34+00:00,IonQ in Talks to Go Public Through Merger with DMY SPAC,"(Bloomberg) -- IonQ is in advanced talks to merge with blank-check company DMY Technology Group Inc. III, according to people with knowledge of the matter, creating one of the first public quantum-computing firms.

The combined company is slated to be worth about $2 billion and a deal is set to be announced in coming weeks, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Silver Lake, MSD Partners, Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy and an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Co. are in talks to participate in a so-called strategic private investment in public equity, or PIPE.

Shares of the SPAC surged 15% at 10:24 a.m. in New York.

DMY Technology is discussing raising additional equity from institutional investors, and new equity from strategic and institutional investors is set to total around $300 million, one of the people said. Existing IonQ investors are expected to roll their equity into the transaction, according to one of the people.

As with any deal that hasn’t been finalized, it’s possible terms change or talks fall apart. Representatives for IonQ and DMY declined to comment, as did spokesmen for Silver Lake and MSD Partners. Representatives of Hyundai and Breakthrough Energy Ventures didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The SPAC, led by Chairman Harry You and Chief Executive Officer Niccolo De Masi, raised $300 million in November and said at the time it would pursue a target in consumer technology.

College Park, Maryland-based IonQ was founded in 2015 by Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim and is led by CEO Peter Chapman. Its investors include Amazon Web Services, Samsung Catalyst Fund, GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), NEA, Lockheed Martin Corp., Airbus Ventures and Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH. IonQ in October unveiled what it describes as the world’s most powerful quantum computer.

Quantum has long been touted as the next frontier in technology. Such computers would be capable of simulating and understanding phenomena in the natural world instantly and providing the basis for systems that are unhackable. Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp., among other companies, are also working to advance quantum computing. The technology also has potential implications for producing new materials or creating new drugs.

After reporting another lackluster year of earnings on Tuesday, Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told analysts on an earnings conference call he still plans to close 125 stores as part of a plan unveiled in early 2020. About 60 of those stores are closed or are closing soon, Gennette said. The rest will be shuttered by the fourth quarter of 2022.

When all is said and done, Macy's will mostly be found in A and B rated malls, which are often seen as the best looking and most visited in the country. That means very few Macy's stores in C rated locations, or ones with usually weak levels of traffic but that still support a key part of the community.

""Following the closure of all 125 stores, at least 85% of our sales will come from A and B mall stores, and we will ensure through targeted incremental investments that all remaining Macy's represent the best of our brand,"" Gennette confirmed.

Macy's 2020 underscores Gennette's fierce focus on cutting costs throughout the organization, in large part by dismantling the company's vast store network.

Shredded by COVID-19 related store closures and tepid store traffic, Macy's net sales crashed 29.3% year-over-year to $17.34 billion last year. Macy's swung to an adjusted net loss of $688 million in 2020, compared to a $906 million profit a year earlier. The company forecast adjusted earnings of 40 cents to 90 cents a share this year — the range still puts Macy's below its pre-pandemic adjusted EPS of $2.91 in 2019.

Wall Street surprisingly continues to be patient with Macy's. But sell-side analysts remain in agreement Macy's has an uphill fight moving forward.

""While we do see the Polaris strategy as a good guide for much-needed cost reduction and rightsizing, we remain Neutral rated as we consider the exposure of Macy's largely mall-based fleet, which we expect to continue facing pressures,"" said Guggenheim Securities analyst Robert Drbul, referring to Macy's three-year plan to stabilize profitability.

We note surprising patience as Macy's stock price continues to act terribly amid a long stretch of disappointing results and various new restructuring initiatives.

Macy's shares are down 6% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain. The stock is down 34% over a two-year timeframe, and down 63% over the past five years.

72,2021-02-23T23:39:23+00:00,"Senators, Tech Execs Recommend Hack Reporting Requirement","(Bloomberg) -- A bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday recommended that the U.S. consider requiring companies to disclose when they have been hacked.

At the first public hearing before Congress since a massive cyber-attack by suspected Russian hackers was disclosed in December, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat, was joined by the vice chairman of the committee, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, in calling for the measure. Several others, including Senator Angus King, an independent, also voiced their support, as did several of the tech executives who were testifying.

There is currently no federal data breach notification law.

“It is time, not only to talk about, but to find a way to take action to impose in an appropriate manner, some kind of notification obligation on entities in the private sector,” said Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith. “I think it is the only way we’re going to protect the country, and I think it is the only way we’re going to protect the world.”

FireEye Inc. Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mandia said he supported a requirement that companies notify an appropriate government agency about being hacked. But he urged that it be confidential, to encourage companies to participate amid liability concerns.

The hearing before Warner’s committee on Tuesday included Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the CEO of SolarWinds Corp. -- the Texas-based software firm that the hackers compromised as part of the attack. He told the committee that the tool hackers used to compromise the company’s software “poses a grave risk of automated supply chain attacks” across the software industry.

The senators mostly used a light touch in questioning Ramakrishna -- who started at SolarWinds in January after the hack was disclosed -- about his company’s responsibility in the massive cyber-attack. He said his company is investigating three possible ways the attackers may have used to gain access to the company’s networks but haven’t reached a conclusion.

Story continues

The senators were much tougher on Amazon Web Services for not appearing at the hearing despite an invitation. According to SolarWinds, its Orion software platform -- which was compromised by the hackers -- could be deployed by customers on AWS among other cloud platforms.

“The operation we will be discussing today used their infrastructure, at least in part,” Rubio said. “Apparently they were too busy to discuss that here today.”

Amazon.com Inc. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The hackers responsible for the incident inserted malicious code into SolarWinds’s software, which was delivered to as many as 18,000 customers through software updates, though fewer are believed to have been targeted with additional hacking.

The White House has confirmed that the hackers leveraged this access to breach more than 100 companies and nine U.S. agencies with follow-on hacking aimed at espionage.

Mandia, of FireEye, said the attackers were “exceptionally hard to detect.” He added that the hackers appeared to be highly concerned with remaining hidden. “The minute you could detect these folks and stopped them breaking through the door, they sort of evaporated like ghosts until their next operation.”

FireEye discovered the hacking campaign while investigating a breach of its own networks. Mandia said in his prepared remarks that the company found an intrusion in late November and determined that a third-party had accessed their network without authorization. FireEye disclosed the cyber-attack in December.

Smith told the committee that Microsoft’s threat hunters and engineers analyzed the attack and estimated there were 1,000 developers who worked on the attack. “It is the largest and most sophisticated operation of this sort that we’ve seen,” he said.

Another witness at the hearing, George Kurtz, the co-founder and CEO of Crowdstrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by SolarWinds for incident response, called for improvements to federal cybersecurity. He said old computer systems and compliance rules “detract from their core security work.”

While a mandatory data breach notification law is one mechanism by which Congress could improve U.S. cybersecurity, the prospects of passing such a law in 2021 are slim given competing Covid-19 relief priorities, according to Dominique Shelton Leipzig, a privacy and cybersecurity attorney at Perkins Coie LLP.

“Realistically, the chances of getting a federal omnibus privacy and data security law are looking more likely to happen next year,” she said.

Businesses want a federal law since they currently have to comply with differing data breach notification laws in all 50 states, she said. “This is the perfect example where companies are calling out for guidance both on the privacy and data security side,” she said.

73,2021-02-23T19:00:58+00:00,It’s ‘not necessarily the greatest environment for government bonds’: Strategist,"Brian Jacobsen, Multi-Asset Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, joins Yahoo Finance’s Kristin Myers to reflect on the rise in yields and how investors should be reallocating their portfolios amid tech sell-off.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, market action right now, again, remains in the red as we see big tech sell off, NASDAQ down about 2 and 3/10 of a percentage point. As we've been talking about investors rotating out of some of those big tech names, we are seeing Tesla taking a huge hit today in the red. You can see right there some of those tech stocks under pressure, Tesla down over 5% right now, Apple down also 2.7%, and Zoom right now down over 5%.

We've got Brian Jacobsen here with us. He's a Wells Fargo Asset Management multi-asset strategist. Brian, always good to have you with us. So let's start with what Jay Powell was talking about today, again, soothing some of these fears around inflation, and yesterday, when talking about the rising bond yields. UBS's Tom McLoughlin said to us that this was transitory, echoing some of what we heard from Powell today. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on this.

BRIAN JACOBSEN: Yeah, so obviously, there's been quite the move up in yields. And unfortunately, it's been in the yields that are probably most relevant to helping support this economic recovery. Right, a lot of people look at the overnight rate for the federal funds rate, and it's not that relevant to them. But when you see it showing up in the 10-year Treasury yield or mortgage rates, then it becomes real. And you can understand why these move ups in yields can really give some investors a little moment of pause.

But Chair Powell seems to suggest, which we agree, is that the yields have moving up for kind of a good reason. Initially, it was rising inflation expectations. That seems relatively contained. But now it's more because of the better growth outlook. So our big concern is whether or not we have moved up too far, too fast, at least for the market to be able to digest it. Maybe that's why we've had a bit of a pullback in the last couple of days. But as long as we don't go up too much higher than where we are, let's say 1.5% on the 10-year Treasury, it shouldn't really be too much of a headwind for the broader economic recovery.

Story continues

KRISTIN MYERS: And the 10-year right now holding steady, just below 1.4 now. I see that 1.5 is that level that you got-- that you are giving us right now. What are you thinking in terms of timing either for the markets to kind of digest some of this news as you were saying, or for investors really to go back into the markets and for some of those yields to come down?

BRIAN JACOBSEN: Well, we think that from a time frame perspective here, that it's really about what's next for the Fed, the next speech. Obviously, we'd like it if it was tied to the calendar, as to when their next meeting is. Oftentimes, it's the slip of the tongue that tends to move yields either up or down. If you remember back to 2013 with then chair Ben Bernanke, the famous taper tantrum just because he said in a speech, at some point, we're going to be stopping this asset purchase program not now, not tomorrow, but at some point in the future. And the market sold off on that, yields rose.

We think that the Federal Reserve is going to be very careful in trying to craft and control their messaging around that. So we think that we could see maybe a slow grind higher with yields. Which makes us very optimistic about the outlook for equities. Not necessarily the greatest environment for government bonds, but we think it's actually very good for equities and for the more what are called the credit sensitive parts of the market, like high yield bonds and lower quality investment grade debt.

KRISTIN MYERS: Looking out at equities over the rest of the year, of course, we saw big tech under pressure today, and we've kept hearing that big tech probably isn't going to be leading the market in 2021. So for some of our investors out there, especially some of the folks that really got in during the pandemic, how should they be thinking about reallocating their portfolios in this current environment?

BRIAN JACOBSEN: The way that we're trying to coach our clients and the way that we're managing our clients' money is to really try to pivot more into those parts of the market that have underperformed, not just over the last year, but really, if you think about it, the last, say, five years or even the last 10 years. Is there some maybe valuation catch-up that can happen?

That would be more with what are called the value part of the spectrum. So if you think about, like, financials and industrials, companies that typically trade at lower market multiples-- so the earnings per share relative to their market prices-- those have underperformed over the last 10 years or so. And so those are areas that we find very attractive and should benefit, we think, from a continued economic improvement.

But then there's also a broad net when you look outside of the United States, as far as emerging markets and even in Europe and Japan. And so, for us, we're encouraging clients to continue to sort of lean into those parts of the market that most underperformed because we believe that the economic fundamentals are improving, and that this isn't just some sort of ephemeral one to two-year bounce in growth, that this actually has a lot of legs to it.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, Brian Jacobsen, Wells Fargo Asset Management multi-strategist, thanks so much-- multi-asset strategist, excuse me-- thanks so much for joining us today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/not-necessarily-greatest-environment-government-190058605.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'EEM.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'IHSEF.US', 'MSFT.US', 'TSLA.US', 'XLF.US', 'ZM.US']","['BOND YIELDS', 'JACOBSEN']","{'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.095}"

If you want to skip our discussion of the growth of the cloud computing industry and recent trends in the sector, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Cloud Computing Companies.

When venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote his prescient essay titled ""Software Is Eating the World"" in 2011, many thought he was overreacting to the information technology boom. Today, software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. At the core of this software revolution is Cloud. Companies are swiftly migrating to Cloud platforms to save costs, increase efficiency and accessibility. Interestingly, Andreessen had mention the rise of Cloud computing in his essay.

In 2000, when my partner Ben Horowitz was CEO of the first cloud computing company, Loudcloud, the cost of a customer running a basic Internet application was approximately $150,000 a month. Running that same application today in Amazon's cloud costs about $1,500 a month.

The pandemic has accelerated the current trends in technology, hastening the adoption of certain innovations. For instance, the work-from-home trend fueled the demand for software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based solutions. Microsoft Teams reported a huge increase in the number of active users, from 44 million active users in March 2020 to 115 million daily users in October 2020.

Investors Pouring Money Into Cloud

Investors are also pouring money into the Cloud computing startups amid huge growth prospects and low risk factors involved. According to CB Insights, the number of deals in the cloud computing space reached 97 during the second quarter of 2020, up from 76 during the same period in 2019. Investors funneled about $3 billion into Cloud startups from April to June 2020.

Companies prefer to use Cloud solutions instead of using legacy hardware or software. However, security has been a major concern for companies that want to move to Cloud platforms. But several startups are racing to solve that problem. For example, Massachusetts-based startup Snyk Inc helps developers detect vulnerabilities in Cloud applications and resolve them. The company has raised over $400 million from investors. Similarly, Cockroach Labs that helps companies manage their data architecture over Cloud, raised over $86 million in Series E in January 2021 and was valued at about $2 billion.

The AI Factor

Cloud computing services have revolutionized everything from contact monitoring to delivery services, telemedicine, and online shopping. The adaptation of technology during the coronavirus outbreak has greatly impacted the cloud computing industry. Cloud computing and AI along with IoT, are the main drivers in improving technology and growth in the Industrial 4.0 period. According to Oracle's Cloud 2020 report, about 60% of the 1,200 technology decision-makers surveyed in midsize and large companies across EMEA spoke in favor of an integrated solution approach and said that it would unlock the potential of disruptive technologies, such as robotics and artificial intelligence. 15 most valuable cloud computing companies

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are the key enablers to improve the efficiency and speed of cloud computing services. In return, cloud-based services will fuel important technological innovations including contact tracing as part of pandemic response planning, smart city infrastructure, and the development of autonomous vehicles.

A Growing Industry

According to the in-depth market analysis from Markets and Markets, the global cloud computing industry was valued at $371 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a market value of $832 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5%.

77,2021-02-22T22:13:30+00:00,Kohl's activist investor: Get rid of the full-time flight crew and 2 private jets,"Jonathan Duskin of Macellum Capital, the lead activist investor in a new campaign against off-mall department store Kohl's, has a message for Kohl's long-tenured board and often too optimistic management team: it's well beyond time to slash costs to help improve shareholder returns.

One measure that will help Kohl's (KSS) cut costs is eliminating the full-time flight crew and two private jets it allegedly still ""maintains"", according to a scathing 27-page letter Duskin and his consortium of activists in the campaign released on Monday.

""It's always really tough to find the tiniest little thing, but it would be better if they didn't have those things,"" Duskin told Yahoo Finance Live, referring to Kohl's alleged flight crew and two private planes.

A Kohl's spokeswoman didn't return requests for comment on the status of the alleged flight crew and two private planes.

The last time Kohl's referenced its aircraft was in its 2019 proxy filing released on March 26, 2020 detailing how CEO Michelle Gass used the assets.

""As Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Gass is permitted to use the Company’s aircraft for personal flights as well as business flights. This benefit increases the safety and efficiency of Ms. Gass’ travel. We believe these perquisites are reasonable based upon the relatively small expense in relation to both executive pay and our total benefit expenditures,"" Kohl's stated.

In 2019, Ms. Gass — who joined Kohl's in 2013 as chief customer officer and took over as CEO in May 2018 — incurred $197,490 in compensation related to the use of the retailer's aircraft, according to the filing.

""Amounts shown are the incremental costs of personal use of Kohl’s-owned or chartered aircraft, and are based on either actual charter expense or, with respect to Kohl’s-owned aircraft utilization, the direct cost of use per hour, which includes fuel, maintenance, engine restoration cost reserves, crew travel expenses, landing and parking fees and supplies,"" explained Kohl's of Gass' air travel expense.

Duskin said such an expense doesn't make sense in light of Kohl's tepid operating margin and Return on Investment Capital (ROIC) performances in recent years.

""Declining gross margin dollars are the problem and in so many different areas of SG&A [expenses]. This is a company that will tell you with a straight face they are doing an excellent job of controlling costs and really driving cost-cutting throughout the organization. We just don't see it to the bottom line. Costs have increased by $450 million [from 2014 to 2019, per the activist letter]. It kind of falls hollow on us that there is that kind of culture, and a flight crew and two private jets is another example of that,"" Duskin said.

The battle begins

The activist group attacking Kohl's includes Duskin's Macellum Advisors, Ancora Holdings, Legion Partners Asset Management and 4010 Capital. They now control a combined 9.5% stake in Kohl’s. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The group nominated nine people to Kohl's already enormous 12-person board.

They collectively blasted Kohl's for ""poor retail execution,"" ""excessive executive compensation,"" a ""long-tenured Board with insufficient retail experience,"" and a ""systemic inability to achieve stated goals.""

A source familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance the campaign is not a ""catch and kill"" attack on the CEO. Rather, they would like to work with Gass to turn the company around.

Duskin told Yahoo Finance Live he would like Gass to succeed as CEO, and it would be good to get her access to a board with strong retail experience.

Kohl's fired back at the activists, and clearly has a different view of how it's doing right now.

""Kohl’s is committed to maintaining constructive engagement with all shareholders regarding the Company’s strategies and prospects. The Kohl’s Board and management team have been engaged in discussions with the Investor Group since early December, and we remain open to new ideas that will improve our operating performance and capital allocation. However, we reject the Investor Group’s attempt to seize control of our Board and disrupt our momentum, especially considering that we are well underway in implementing a strong growth strategy and accelerating our performance, and we have refreshed half our Board with six new independent directors since 2016,"" Kohl's said in a new statement released Monday afternoon.

A source familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance the two sides remain far apart in reaching a compromise.

The activists — who last teamed up in 2019 to shake up then dreadfully performing Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) — appear to be well-placed in their efforts. While Kohl's has garnered favorable headlines for its partnerships with Amazon (AMZN) (for store returns) and more recently cosmetics giant Sephora, the company simply has not delivered on several fronts.

The operating performance is more disappointing considering Kohl's pure-play rivals such as J.C. Penney and Macy's have closed hundreds of stores in the past five years. Theoretically, that should have pushed market share to Kohl's (something suggested in the letter).

That hasn't happened.

Here are some stats on Kohl's over the past five years. It's important to look at the results pre-pandemic because sales and profits have fallen off a cliff during the pandemic, like other retailers.

Stock price in the past five years is up 18% versus a 92% gain for the S&P 500. Target shares up 161%. Same-store sales (excluding 2020) declined in two of the past five years, with only minor gains in the other three, according to Bloomberg data Operating margin past five years (excluding 2020) hit 5.5% in 2019, down from 8.09% in 2015, according to Bloomberg data. Management's goal has been 7% to 8%. Fourth quarter same-store sales plunged 11%.

Kohl's shares rose 6.4% on the session.

83,2021-02-22T14:07:29+00:00,Ambani’s $3.4 Billion Retail Deal Stalled by Indian Court,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s Supreme Court stopped regulatory approval for the Future Group’s $3.4 billion asset sale to Reliance Industries Ltd., delaying the deal in a boost for Amazon.com Inc., which wants to scuttle the transaction in its bid to dominate the country’s retail sector.

Agreeing with the American e-commerce giant’s petition, the top court on Monday overturned a lower court’s ruling and said the National Company Law Tribunal can continue hearing the case but must not give a final nod till further orders. The court also sought written statements from Future Retail Ltd. and said it will hear the case after three weeks. Future’s stocks and bonds fell.

”In the meantime, the NCLT proceedings will be allowed to go on but will not culminate in any final order of sanction of scheme,” according to the order posted on the court’s website.

The latest verdict restores the legal advantage for Jeff Bezos-founded Amazon that secured an interim stay on the deal from a Singapore arbitration tribunal in October. It accused the Future Group of violating a partnership contract when it agreed to sell assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate last year. The Monday order, however, endangers Future Retail, which is struggling to pay debt and has warned of insolvency.​

​Future Retail’s stock fell as much as 10% and its dollar bond maturing in 2025 dropped 3.8 cents on the dollar after the court order Monday, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. Reliance Industries also slipped as much as 2.8%.

Representatives for Amazon India, Future and Reliance Industries didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Future Retail can move the Singapore arbitration tribunal to lift the interim stay the emergency arbitrator had imposed, that has formed the basis of Indian Supreme Court’s order.

The cash strapped Indian retailer, which says it would collapse should the deal with Reliance fail, is caught between two of the world’s richest men as they compete for dominance in India’s estimated $1 trillion consumer retail market. The legal dispute over Future has turned into a fierce legal wrangle across courtrooms in two countries. Amazon is unwilling to cede any competitive advantage to Reliance in the only billion-people-plus market left in the world after the American firm lost out to local rivals in China.

Story continues

The case is also keenly watched by investors as it sets a precedent on the validity of emergency decisions by foreign arbitrators in India. The verdict comes at a time when Amazon is increasing its footprint in the country. The U.S. firm announced this month that it was setting up manufacturing operations in the South Asian country.

86,2021-02-22T13:02:00+00:00,Activist investors blast Kohl's management in scathing letter,"Kohl's (KSS) is starting its week with activist investors knocking on its door.

On Monday, Kohl's and CEO Michelle Gass — who joined as chief customer officer in 2013 and assumed the CEO role in May 2018 — were blasted by a group of activist investors for ""poor retail execution,"" ""excessive executive compensation,"" a ""long-tenured Board with insufficient retail experience,"" and a ""systemic inability to achieve stated goals.""

The activist group includes Macellum Advisors, Ancora Holdings, Legion Partners Asset Management and 4010 Capital. They now control a combined 9.5% stake in Kohl’s, according to a new letter published Monday. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Kohl's shares rose 8% in afternoon trading.

The group nominated nine people to Kohl's already enormous 12-person board, the letter says. The activists are pushing for Kohl's to slash inventory levels to cut costs, do a sale-leaseback transaction for some stores to boost cash and lower costs and make promotions easier for customers to understand.

""The Board has overseen a long list of sales and margin driving initiatives which have created no meaningful value for shareholders,"" the activists wrote in a scathing new letter to management. The full letter is below.

A source familiar with the matter tells Yahoo Finance the campaign is not a ""catch and kill"" attack on the CEO. Rather, they would like to work with Gass to turn the company around. A view of Kohl's during the coronavirus pandemic on May 12, 2020 in Queens borough of New York City. (AP)

The operating performance is more disappointing considering Kohl's pure-play rivals such as J.C. Penney and Macy's have closed hundreds of stores the past five years. Theoretically, that should have pushed market share to Kohl's.

That hasn't happened.

Here are some stats from Yahoo Finance on Kohl's looking out over the past five years. We felt it important to look at the results pre-pandemic (Kohl's sales and profits have fallen off a cliff during the pandemic, just like other retailers):

Stock price last five years: up 18% versus a 92% gain for the S&P 500. Target shares up 161%. Same-store sales last five years (excluding 2020): sales declined in two of the last five years, with only minor gains in the other three. Source: Bloomberg data Operating margin last five years (excluding 2020): hit 5.5% in 2019, down from 8.09% in 2015. Source: Bloomberg data. Management's goal has been 7% to 8%. Fourth quarter same-store sales: company came out on Feb. 4 and said same-store sales for the fourth quarter plunged 11%.

Here's a look at the full letter sent to Kohl's by the activist group.

Macellum Advisors GP, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Macellum”), Ancora Holdings, Inc. (together with its affiliates, “Ancora”), Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Legion Partners”), and 4010 Capital, LLC (together with its affiliates, “4010 Capital” and, together with Macellum, Ancora and Legion Partners, the “Investor Group”) today issued an open letter to shareholders of Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) (“Kohl’s” or the “Company”) and announced the nomination of nine highly-qualified, independent candidates for election to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”). The Investor Group is deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, 14,950,632 shares of the Company’s common stock, including 3,481,600 shares underlying call options currently exercisable, constituting approximately 9.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

In the letter, the Investor Group highlights the following:

∙ Poor retail execution and strategy have led to stagnant sales and declining operating margins. The Board has overseen a long list of sales and margin driving initiatives which have created no meaningful value for shareholders. As a result, Kohl’s has suffered from stagnant sales, market share loss, declining gross margins and bloated SG&A – all of which has contributed to operating income margins declining from 11.5% in 2011 to 6.1% in 2019. In 2019, Kohl’s earned nearly $1 billion less in operating profit, or ~44%, less than it did in 2011, despite similar total sales and $6.6 billion in cumulative capital expenditures.

∙ Long-tenured Board with insufficient retail experience and lack of any material share ownership is an impediment to serving shareholder interests. Until the recent addition of a new director last week, likely in response to our recent private engagement, the Board’s average tenure was approximately 10 years. We also believe the Board lacks relevant retail expertise. Despite this long average tenure, the Board collectively owns just ~0.5% of Kohl’s outstanding shares, which the Investor Group believes has prevented proper oversight of management and shows a lack of alignment with shareholders’ interests.

∙ Excessive executive compensation and poor alignment between pay and performance. The Board has developed and implemented a compensation plan that has increased total compensation despite deteriorating results. From 2010 to 2019, Kohl’s top five executives have increased their total compensation from $20 million to $30 million, despite relatively flat sales and a decline in operating profit by ~42% over the same period.

∙ Systemic inability to achieve stated goals. Many of the initiatives Kohl’s is currently targeting to improve performance were the focus of the “Greatness Agenda” Kohl’s delivered to investors in 2013. The agenda called for $21 billion in sales and $1.9 billion in operating profit by 2017. Those targets were missed by 9% and 25%, respectively, by 2017. By 2019, the operating profit target was missed by 36%.

Kohl’s has tremendous potential with the right Board and leadership in place. Kohl’s has a valuable and dedicated workforce of more than 120,000 employees that can thrive under the right strategic plan. The Investor Group has identified significant opportunities to generate improvements in sales and margins through changes in merchandising, inventory management, customer engagement and expense rationalization, as well as the potential to unlock $7-8 billion of real estate value trapped on the Company’s balance sheet. The Investor Group proposes a strong slate of directors with extensive retail, turnaround, capital allocation and strategic experience, who are well-positioned to create significant shareholder value. The Investor Group’s diverse slate of retail experts will be focused on repositioning Kohl’s for profitable growth and efficient capital allocation, and instituting best-in-class corporate governance.

· With the right Board and strategic plan in place, the Investor Group believes that the Company has the potential to generate more than $10 in annual earnings per share (EPS) within the next few years. In the coming months, the Investor Group looks forward to sharing a detailed plan, developed together with its director nominees, that it believes could drive a material increase in Kohl’s stock price. A sale-leaseback program for $3 billion of real estate, combined with a properly executed large share repurchase program, could be at least 25% accretive to EPS

Amazon appealed to the Supreme Court this month against Future Group's sale to market leader Reliance Industries, accusing its partner of violating contracts by agreeing to the sale.

The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani, could reshape India's pandemic-hit shopping sector and decide if Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of retail.

Three people familiar with Monday's proceedings said the Supreme Court ordered that while the tribunal can continue to review the deal and oversee the approval process, it could not pass a final order while the court hears Amazon's concerns.

""This is a good thing for Amazon,"" said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of events.

Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog have already cleared the deal, which now awaits clearance by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), in line with regulatory procedures.

A second source said Future had only asked the NCLT to let it to call meetings to seek shareholder approvals of the deal. That process will continue, and Future will later seek final approval from the tribunal, the source added.

Amazon declined to comment, while Future Group and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The sources sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.

In its Supreme Court appeal, Amazon will argue that an arbitration order in October that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold remains valid, Reuters has reported.

89,2021-02-21T16:50:36+00:00,Mark Carney Joins Stripe Board Ahead of New Funding Round,"(Bloomberg) -- Former governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada Mark Carney has been appointed to the board of Stripe Inc. amid reports that the financial technology business is preparing a new funding round.

“The very nature of commerce has changed over the past decade,” Carney said in a statement posted on Stripe’s website, and sees the internet as the engine for strong and inclusive economic growth.

Carney, who is the United Nations special envoy for climate action, will help guide Stripe in its efforts to enable more businesses to bring funding to emerging carbon removal technologies, according to the statement.

The appointment, reported earlier by the Sunday Times, comes as Stripe prepares for a new primary funding round. Bloomberg reported in November that the company was is in talks to raise financing that would value Stripe at between $70 billion and $100 billion. Forbes reported last week that the valuation would top $100 billion in the funding round.

Stripe, which sells software allowing businesses to accept online payments, has been a beneficiary of the e-commerce boom accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. The company was valued at $36 billion as recently as April at its last funding round.

It was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison in 2010 and now counts companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. among its customers. The brothers each have a net worth of $4.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The company has recently branched out to offer checking accounts to businesses through e-commerce providers, working with banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc.

In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company raised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. That was at the $36 billion valuation.

Other featured articles discuss who dominates the public cloud, who stands to benefit as Texas rebuilds and how to tell when tech companies are overvalued. Also, the prospects for a private-equity giant, an engineering company, bank stocks, business development companies and more.

Cover story ""Oracle Is Turning Into a Cloud Giant. Why Its Stock Is a Buy"" by Eric J. Savitz discusses how a new giant is starting to flex its muscles in cloud computing, and it isn't some upstart. See why Barron's claims that enterprise software company Oracle Corporation (NYSE: VZ) has been undergoing a Microsoft-like reinvention, and why that makes the stock a buy.

Avi Salzman's ""Texas Looks to Rebuild. Here Are 6 Stocks That Could Benefit"" suggests that companies that provide energy infrastructure and oil-and-gas producers that were spared storm damage in Texas offer opportunities. What does that mean for the likes of Eaton Corporation PLC (NYSE: ETN), Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) and even General Electric Company (NYSE: GE).

In ""Who Rules the Cloud? The Answer Is Hazy,"" Eric J. Savitz points out that the data showing who dominates the U.S. public cloud market are obfuscated by definitions that can make comparisons among providers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) almost impossible. Is that a problem?

Private-equity giant Blackstone Group Inc (NYSE: BX) is pushing hard into life sciences at a critical time, according to ""Blackstone Makes a Big Bet on Life Sciences"" by Liz Moyer. See what that means for Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT), Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) and a number of others.

In Daren Fonda's ""Fluor Is Engineering a Turnaround. Its Stock Could Soar,"" the focus is on how engineering and construction company Fluor Corp (NYSE: FLR) is pivoting toward growth industries and fixing its past problems. Find out why the Texas-based company could be a beneficiary of U.S. infrastructure spending and why Barron's sees the share price rising as much as 80%.

""Tech Valuations Are Getting Scary. Here's How We Know"" by Eric J. Savitz explains that companies such as Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) trade at more than 35 times sales estimates for 2021. That doesn't leave much room for error, and Wall Street doesn't seem to be concerned.

In ""Bank Stocks Are Getting Hot. They Still Have Room to Run,"" Carleton English says that bank stocks today trade roughly where they did a year ago, with the KBW Bank Index up more than 16% this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 4% gain. Find out if Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) or JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) are among those with room to run.

Alexandra Scaggs's ""BDCs Yield Around 9%, but Their Quality Varies.

You can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.

Insider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.

Almost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.

Story continues Best Stocks To Buy Now For Beginner Investors

Warren Buffett

We have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.

Since hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the ""best stocks to buy for beginner investors"". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.

Overall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

You can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.

Insider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.

Almost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.

Warren Buffett

We have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.

Since hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the ""best stocks to buy for beginner investors"". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.

Overall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Below we listed the 15 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of December 2020. We believe these are the 15 best stocks a beginner investor can buy today:

11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS): $183

Number of Hedge Funds: 144 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 112 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $16.42 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.2% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 1.0% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 14 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 18 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA): $338.46

Number of Hedge Funds: 154 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 133 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $18 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.4% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -5.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 10 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 7 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Akre Capital Management, Berkshire Hathaway Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, express

7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA): $264.51

Number of Hedge Funds: 156 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 166 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $17.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 13.7% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 4 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 5 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Ken Fisher

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

This has widespread implications, because — as we noted earlier this month — Apple won’t build the Apple Car by itself. The company will use outside vendors to supply critical hardware for the Apple Car. We believe one such vendor could be LiDAR maker Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR), and that is one of the reasons we’ve been so bullish on LAZR stock. Luminar (LAZR) sign with greenery around it

Source: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com

On Friday, Feb. 19, Bloomberg all but confirmed that is the case.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Apple is, indeed, in talks with LiDAR makers to include their sensors in the Apple Car. The report implied that Apple has yet to decide on a specific LiDAR maker and is continuing to have discussions with various suppliers.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

There is a high probability that, when all is said and done, Luminar will be company that Apple settles on — and therefore, “Apple Car supplier” is very likely in Luminar’s future.

Undoubtedly, the Apple Car will be a big hit. That’s a big reason to buy LAZR stock.

I’m Revealing the Next Amazon Stock for FREE on Tuesday, Feb. 23 — Join Me Here!

Here’s a deeper look.

Luminar Is the Best LiDAR Maker

When Apple builds something, they make it a very high-quality product, with the highest-quality components. So, when it comes to the Apple Car, Apple will likely pick the best LiDAR in the market.

Who makes the best LiDAR in the world?

Luminar.

Relative to other LiDAR sensors, Luminar’s LiDAR have the:

Longest range, at over 250 meters of visibility at 5% reflectivity. Best resolution, with over 300 points per square degree at 10 Hertz. Best performance in adverse weather. Least interference from other LiDAR and/or sunlight.

It’s the best long-range LiDAR on the planet. It just happens to be the lowest-cost LiDAR, too, as Luminar is the only LiDAR maker in the world that is able to integrate its LiDAR sensors in a vehicle for under $1,000.

Story continues

There really is no competition here. Luminar is the best LiDAR maker in the world.

Apple won’t partner with the second-best for the Apple Car. They’ll pick the best. And the best is Luminar. That’s a big positive for LAZR stock.

Apple Car Will Be a Hit

Luminar winning an Apple Car supplier partnership would be big for two reasons.

One, the Apple Car will be a hit.

Apple is Apple. This is the company behind the world’s most popular consumer hardware products, like the iPhone, Mac, iPad and Apple Watch. This is a company with nearly $200 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and about 150,000 highly-qualified employees…

Now, this company – with the most experience in the world, the most money in the world, and the most engineering and design talent in the world – is going to make a car.

This Apple Car has the potential to be truly disruptive… and turn into an enormous hit like the iPhone.

Two, the partnership will be a huge vote of confidence from the world’s largest technology company. Other auto OEMs will take note. Luminar should be able to leverage this partnership win to sign-on multiple other auto OEMs over the next few years.

To that end, Luminar winning the Apple Car contract could be the beginning of an avalanche of new contracts for the LiDAR maker. As all those contracts roll in, LAZR stock will keep pushing higher.

Bottom Line on LAZR Stock

The self-driving revolution has arrived. One of the best ways to play this revolution is by buying perception technology companies. The most important component of the self-driving hardware perception stack is LiDAR, and the best LiDAR maker in the world is Luminar.

On that basis alone, LAZR stock is a great long-term investment. The Apple Car catalyst just adds more firepower to the bull thesis.

But it’s not the best growth stock to buy today.

Instead, the best growth stock to buy today is a company which reminds me of a young Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent.

102,2021-02-19T20:06:06+00:00,E-commerce company Olive looks to make shopping more sustainable,"Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous and Nate Faust, Olive founder, discuss sustainability in e-commerce amid the company’s launch.

Video Transcript

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Welcome back. Nate Faust is no stranger to e-commerce. The co-founder of jet.com and former senior VP at Walmart is looking to disrupt the e-commerce industry with his latest startup, Olive, which consolidates your purchases into a single weekly delivery in a reusable package. Nate's here with us now. Thanks so much for joining us. And congratulations on the launch of Olive, which when I said it was brand new, I wasn't kidding. You launched two days ago. That's not a lot of data to work off of, but how are things at the get-go?

NATE FAUST: Yeah, the response has been great. Obviously still early days, but both from consumers, and I would say what's even been more unexpected over the last few days, we had over 100 retail partners signed up for launch. And we've had significant outreach just in the last 48 hours.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So talk to me about why you felt it necessary to launch Olive. Why did we need a more sustainable e-commerce experience?

NATE FAUST: Yeah, it's funny. You know, I-- as you mentioned, I've been in e-commerce for over a decade now. And I left Walmart about a year ago and was thinking about what I wanted to do next. And want to do something with sustainability impact and hadn't even considered e-commerce, until one night, taking out the trash, just realized how big of a problem this has become from both an environmental perspective and a consumer pain point perspective. And I think that's what really makes it time and ripe for an opportunity to change, is that it really has gotten to the point where, from just a raw convenience perspective, it's become almost inconvenient.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So then how do you sell the platform to people who don't necessarily think twice about the environmental impact they're having every time they have an item shipped to their house in a cardboard box?

Story continues

NATE FAUST: Yeah, absolutely. So the mission of Olive is undeniably on creating a greener supply chain for e-commerce. But our value proposition to consumers is all about convenience. Because we feel the greatest long-term impact will come from a service that customers love to use, regardless of whether they're focused on the environment.

And so with Olive, when you sign up, there's absolutely no fee to consumers. You can shop over 100 of your favorite fashion sites. And everything you order comes delivered in these reusable two-way shippers. And the most convenient aspect is our return process, where there's no labels to print. You just drop any unwanted items back into the two-way shipper, a few clicks in the Olive app, and we pick it up off your doorstep.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So I want to talk a little bit about that process. Because I know it comes to your doorstep in this reusable tote that says Olive on it. And I guess, you then can keep that resealable bag if you're not returning items. If you are returning items, you put them back into that tote. But let's talk about your consolidation facility. Oh, there we go. We're showing some video of how it works right now. So the products are sent to an Olive facility, but aren't they getting to your facility with the same boxes and packaging that you're trying to do away with?

NATE FAUST: Absolutely they are. At the moment, they absolutely are. And we're very transparent about that with consumers. There's actually a dual sustainability impact that we're aiming to have. The first and most noticeable to consumers in the long term will be the elimination of the packaging.

But the more significant benefit from an environmental perspective is actually the fact that we send you-- depending on where you live, we only deliver to each zip code one or two times per week. And so you get multiple deliveries together in one of these two-way shippers, such that the number of truck stops, the number of last mile stops, which is where the majority of post-purchase e-commerce carbon emissions come from, are reduced.

And just one quick thing to note, we actually do still have customers send us back the shipper, even if there's not returns. And the way we do that in the most sustainable way possible is for the majority of our footprint, your local mailman or mail carrier will pick it straight up off your doorstep when they're delivering the mail.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Ah, I was wondering because I was saying, you know, if you use the service enough, you're going to be stuck with a lot of those reusable Olive totes. So that was a good point to make. But, you know, in terms of delivery, I mean, there is this war going on between Amazon and other e-commerce platforms to try to get you your stuff as quickly as possible. That doesn't seem to necessarily be a priority, though at Olive, is it?

NATE FAUST: It's not. In the longer term, delivery frequency will become faster and faster as consumers order more through the Olive platform. But we always have the benefit to reduce the number of trips. And I used to be part of those delivery wars, starting out at a startup called diapers.com, where we were one of the first companies to do same day delivery in New York.

I worked at Amazon for a while, was part of Amazon-- or sorry, part of Walmart-- as we drove two-day delivery, next day delivery, and now, most recently, Walmart Plus has launched-- which are all incredible services, but there's other elements to the delivery experience that haven't even been offered to consumers. And in the research and studies that we've done, these are huge opportunities to deliver different customer experiences and ones that customers want, even though they might not know they want them because they haven't existed previously.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So I know you're starting out with-- you say you have, like, 100 retailers that you're working with. And this is mostly fashion and apparel. But do you see yourself expanding to other kinds of products? And I'm thinking food, maybe perishables, where, you know, delivery and the speed of delivery then becomes more of an issue.

NATE FAUST: Sure, so the long-term goal is to be able to deliver and service absolutely everything that you buy online. Apparel is a great place to start because it's the largest online shopping category, and it's also the one in which consumers shop at the most number of different outlets, enabling the greatest benefit of this consolidation.

In the future, as we do add other categories, the more a consumer buys through all Olive partners, the greater that consolidation benefit can become, even with more frequent delivery. So in the long term, a very frequent shopper would still get, effectively, the same delivery speed that they would otherwise.

Video Transcript

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Welcome back. Nate Faust is no stranger to e-commerce. The co-founder of jet.com and former senior VP at Walmart is looking to disrupt the e-commerce industry with his latest startup, Olive, which consolidates your purchases into a single weekly delivery in a reusable package. Nate's here with us now. Thanks so much for joining us. And congratulations on the launch of Olive, which when I said it was brand new, I wasn't kidding. You launched two days ago. That's not a lot of data to work off of, but how are things at the get-go?

NATE FAUST: Yeah, the response has been great. Obviously still early days, but both from consumers, and I would say what's even been more unexpected over the last few days, we had over 100 retail partners signed up for launch. And we've had significant outreach just in the last 48 hours.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So talk to me about why you felt it necessary to launch Olive. Why did we need a more sustainable e-commerce experience?

NATE FAUST: Yeah, it's funny. You know, I-- as you mentioned, I've been in e-commerce for over a decade now. And I left Walmart about a year ago and was thinking about what I wanted to do next. And want to do something with sustainability impact and hadn't even considered e-commerce, until one night, taking out the trash, just realized how big of a problem this has become from both an environmental perspective and a consumer pain point perspective. And I think that's what really makes it time and ripe for an opportunity to change, is that it really has gotten to the point where, from just a raw convenience perspective, it's become almost inconvenient.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So then how do you sell the platform to people who don't necessarily think twice about the environmental impact they're having every time they have an item shipped to their house in a cardboard box?

Story continues

NATE FAUST: Yeah, absolutely. So the mission of Olive is undeniably on creating a greener supply chain for e-commerce. But our value proposition to consumers is all about convenience. Because we feel the greatest long-term impact will come from a service that customers love to use, regardless of whether they're focused on the environment.

And so with Olive, when you sign up, there's absolutely no fee to consumers. You can shop over 100 of your favorite fashion sites. And everything you order comes delivered in these reusable two-way shippers. And the most convenient aspect is our return process, where there's no labels to print. You just drop any unwanted items back into the two-way shipper, a few clicks in the Olive app, and we pick it up off your doorstep.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So I want to talk a little bit about that process. Because I know it comes to your doorstep in this reusable tote that says Olive on it. And I guess, you then can keep that resealable bag if you're not returning items. If you are returning items, you put them back into that tote. But let's talk about your consolidation facility. Oh, there we go. We're showing some video of how it works right now. So the products are sent to an Olive facility, but aren't they getting to your facility with the same boxes and packaging that you're trying to do away with?

* Direct sites enable companies to mine customer data better

* Sales via U.S. retail companies' own websites expected totop$20 billion in 2021 -eMarketer

By Siddharth Cavale and Nivedita Balu

Feb 19 (Reuters) - Packaged food giants including KraftHeinz, General Mills and Kellogg arepushing sales of their products to consumers directly via theirown online channels, in a quest to gather more data aboutshoppers' purchasing habits.

Velveeta-cheese maker Kraft Heinz saw its e-commerce salesdouble in 2020, now representing more than 5% of its globalsales, Chief Executive Miguel Patricio said at the virtualConsumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference this week.

The company sells Heinz baked beans and tomato soup bysubscription or in bundles directly to consumers on a ""Heinz ToHome"" website in the United Kingdom, Australia and Europe.

Sales on the site are ""giving us valuable insights intoconsumer behavior, enabling us to quickly test and learn frominnovations,"" Kraft's head of international business, Rafael deOliveira, said at the conference.

Kraft would continue to use the site as a channel togenerate strong sales in developed markets, he said.

The company also counts sales of its products throughmarketplaces such as on Amazon.com and Walmart.comas part of its e-commerce sales.

U.S. shoppers spent on average $1,271 buying groceriesonline last year, 45% more than they did in 2019 as the pandemicspurred shopping online, according to market research firmEarnest Research. In contrast, the average dollars spent instores rose only about 7% to $3,849.

PepsiCo sells products including Doritos, Quakeroats and Gatorade directly to consumers through two websites,pantryshop.com and snacks.com, both launched in 2020.

Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that more than45% of the company's capital investments over the next few yearswould be dedicated toward manufacturing capacity, automation,and a ""ramping up of investments in our e-commerce channel.""

As major online retailers including Amazon.com andWalmart.com continue to gather valuable data on shoppers, manypackaged food manufacturers are keen to gather their own data onshoppers, too.

""COVID (has) simply accelerated our digital growth and hasprovided us with yet another source of data and insight,"" MonicaMcGurk, chief growth officer at breakfast cereal maker KelloggCo., told the conference.

Kellogg, producer of Corn Flakes as well as Pringles chips,said on Wednesday it had launched a direct-to-consumer websitefocused on digestive wellness. The group plans to sell its newMwell Microbiome Powder for gut health via the site to gatherdata on customer interest before it launches the product morewidely.

E-commerce sales have doubled in the past year and nowrepresent about 8.5% of the group's $13.77 billion in annualsales, Kellogg said.

Pillsbury dough-maker General Mills also sees thebenefits of tracking consumer habits more closely.

""We're aggressively investing in data and analytics. We aregathering unparalleled insights from the first-party data wecollect through our brand websites,” General Mills' ChiefExecutive Jeffrey Harmening said at the conference.

On its Bettycrocker.com website, General Mills provideshundreds of recipes using Betty Crocker cake mixes and frosting.The site leads people to the closest store or an online retailerwhere they can purchase the products, thereby generating datafor General Mills on what a particular customer from a certainzip code is buying. The company does not sell the food productsdirectly on its website.

Consumers, however, may have to shell out more if they shopdirectly from brand websites.

Prices on the two PepsiCo sites, for example, were generallyhigher than those on Walmart.com or Amazon.com, Reuters checksshow. On Walmart.com, for example, a 10 oz pack of Doritos NachoCheese was on sale for $2.50 compared to $4.29 on Pepsico’swebsite.

Kraft Heinz offers tins of soup, beans, pasta and baby foodbundled into packs ranging from six to 25 items and costingbetween 10 and 20 pounds ($14.01-$28.03) on its UK website. Ittold Reuters the relatively higher prices of items and bundlingof packs than on some other online marketplaces was to be ableto eke out a margin after including delivery costs.

""Longer term, we see real value in this channel to be aninsight and data channel for us,"" Jean-Philippe Nier, head ofe-commerce for Kraft Heinz's business in the UK and Ireland,told Reuters. People are more prepared to order directly frommanufacturers than they were before. The time is now.""($1 = 0.7137 pounds)

105,2021-02-19T18:02:34+00:00,There Has Never Been a Better Time to Buy Axon Stock,"Law enforcement technology company Axon (NASDAQ:AXON) has long been one of my favorite growth stocks in the market. My bullishness dates back to when Axon was still named Taser International, and traded under the ticker symbol ‘TASR.” At the time, the TASR stock price was $20. Today, AXON stock trades near $200. A police issued Taser X26 stun gun and two cartridges are displayed on a table for inspection.

The bull thesis on AXON stock this entire time has been shockingly consistent and simple.

Law enforcement agencies across the globe are antiquated. They’re stuck in the 20th Century. They need to modernize and digitize. Axon is creating a suite of compelling products to help them do just that, like body cameras, smart weapons and cloud-hosted records management systems.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The company has virtually no competition in this space, having either acquired or squashed all other relevant police tech companies.

The opportunity is enormous, as police spending in the U.S. measures nearly $200 billion every year — and peaks into the trillions of dollars globally. The business model is highly profitable, as Axon commands pricing power on its hardware products given the lack of competition, and is quickly growing its much-higher-margin software business.

From head to toe, AXON stock is a winner. That much is obvious. But you may be looking at the AXON stock chart and asking yourself: Did I miss the opportunity to buy AXON stock?

I’m Revealing the Next Amazon Stock for FREE on Tuesday, Feb. 23 — Join Me Here!

No. Far from it. In fact, there’s never been a better time to buy AXON stock.

Here’s why.

Police Spending Is About to Surge

With Joe Biden now the President of the United States, police spending in America is in a position to surge over the next few years — and all those dollars will likely get allocated to the things Axon sells.

Here’s the thing.

Some Democrats may have adopted the “defund the police” movement. Biden did not. In fact, Biden has said consistently on his campaign trail that his plan to improve law enforcement is to give police more money to improve themselves. He reiterated that recently in a town hall on national TV, saying ““We have to put more money for this to work.”

Story continues

So, it’s safe to say that police spending will increase dramatically over the next four years — and maybe even longer.

Over that stretch, sociopolitical pressures will force law enforcement agencies to spend that extra budget on things that actually improve law enforcement operations. Things like smart weapons (to decrease fatal encounters), body cameras (to increase transparency), cloud solutions (to improve operational efficiency), etc.

Axon sells all of those things. Indeed, they sell the best smart weapons, the best body cameras, the best cloud solutions, so on and so forth.

Net net, it looks like Axon is positioned to have a blockbuster next four years — and AXON stock will power way higher during this stretch.

Axon’s Business Momentum Is Accelerating on All Fronts

As police spending significantly increases, Axon’s business momentum will continue accelerating — even without expanded police budgets.

In 2021 alone, Axon has done the following:

Sold body cameras in new geographies for the first time ever. Axon sold body cameras to the Ravenna Municipal Police in January, and it will be Italy’s first police department to deploy Axon’s body cameras. With this deal, Axon is not just a U.S. story; It’s a global police tech company, with an addressable market into the trillions. Received huge follow-on orders. Also in January, the Los Angeles Police Department renewed its contract with Axon, setting it up for the largest TASER 7 smart weapon deployment in the world. Axon additionally received big orders from the Fairfax County Police Department, the Suffolk County Police Department, the San Jose Police Department and the Tucson Police Department. Jumped into the private security market. Axon signed a body-camera partnership with private security company Cancom in January, underscoring the need for body cameras extends well beyond police and into security, too.

That’s all in just one month. Talk about momentum.

With all this momentum at its back, Axon is in a great position to turn a surge in police spending over the next four years into a surge in revenues and profits at the company.

I’m Revealing the Next Amazon Stock for FREE on Tuesday, Feb. 23 — Join Me Here!

As that happens, AXON stock will power higher.

Bottom Line on AXON Stock

Axon stock is one of the best long-term growth stocks in the market today. Long-term, it has huge upside potential.

But it’s not the best growth stock to buy today.

Instead, the best growth stock to buy today is a company that reminds me of a young Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent.

Admittedly, growth stocks can come with high valuations and increased volatility. However, they aren’t all like that. Many have the best margins in the market and balance sheets that appear impenetrable.

These are some of the most valuable companies on earth for a reason — and not because we’re in a bubble. Instead, it’s because they have superior brands (moats), robust growth and fat profit margins.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

If these stocks aren’t for certain investors, that’s fine. But understand that they help drive the overall indices higher, too. Although growth names can have higher volatility from time to time, long-term holders can see massive returns. Sometimes, those returns are life-changing.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

So, let’s look at a few top growth stocks that investors should keep their eye on:

Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Invitae (NYSE:NVTA)

Growth Stocks to Buy: Pinterest (PINS) the pinterest (PINS) logo on a mobile phone held by a woman

Pinterest is one of the best growth stocks I’m aware of right now. It has robust revenue momentum, it’s profitable and it has a great balance sheet. Best of all? Wall Street still seems skeptical.

In mid-February, the company turned in an impressive fourth-quarter earnings report as top- and bottom-line results blew past estimates. Guidance for the next quarter came in well ahead of expectations, too.

Simply put, analysts have been far too conservative and it shows. Wall Street has practically blown off the company’s lights-out quarter, although they were willing to gobble up the stock on reports that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was interested in acquiring the name a few months ago.

Story continues

Even though those talks are reportedly not ongoing, perhaps that gives investors faith that there could be a bid in the stock price in the event of a deeper correction.

Obviously, anything can happen in the market — such as a quick 25% pullback, for instance — but PINS stock seems like it has significant upside in the future. Particularly with the valuations that Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are garnering despite their inferior businesses.

Salesforce (CRM) A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce (CRM) sticker.

One reason I really like Salesforce as one of the growth stocks to buy on this list? Simply that it hasn’t been participating in the rally.

Sure, we all love seeing relative strength in our holdings and we enjoy stocks making record highs. But let’s face it: it can be hard to pull the trigger on some names as they continue to crank out new high after new high.

Thankfully, though, there are some high-quality holdings that aren’t doing that on a daily basis. Salesforce is one of them.

CRM stock just hit a multi-month high, yet it remains about 15% below its all-time highs. The stock commands a market capitalization of “just” $227 billion. While large, it’s possible that Salesforce will become one of tech’s future titans — like FAANG.

7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Aren’t a Gamble

With strong revenue-growth forecasts for the next few years, I expect CRM to continue churning out free cash flow and making savvy acquisitions like Slack (NYSE:WORK). Further, investments like those made in Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) should continue to pay dividends.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) a Google Pixel smartphone

Speaking of FAANG, let’s look at that group’s best performing component in 2021 and over the last six months.

When it comes to growth stocks, Alphabet has been in a league of its own. While mega-cap tech stocks continue to consolidate, shares in GOOG stock continue to rocket higher.

The company commands a $1.4 trillion market cap and the stock is up 36% over the last six months. However, that doesn’t mean it’s done going higher. Of course, Alphabet stock will eventually need to rest, but right now it’s firing on all cylinders.

For instance, the company’s recent Q4 earnings report was robust. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $22.30 came in about 40% ahead of consensus expectations, while revenue of $56.9 billion grew 23.5% year-over-year (YOY) and beat estimates by about $4 billion.

On top of that, analysts expect solid growth over the next several years as well.

Alphabet stock will go through its consolidation phase eventually, but this one is ultimately a long-term winner. It owns the two most popular websites in the world — Google and YouTube — and it has solid, steady growth.

Lastly, its balance sheet is robust. The company’s total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities sit at more than $136 billion while its long-term debt rests at just $13.9 billion.

Farfetch (FTCH) farfetch (FTCH) logo next to a hanger

While Farfetch has done a great job of holding its recent gains, this pick seems undervalued by Wall Street. Couple that with its strong growth and FTCH stock is a perfect candidate when it comes to growth stocks to build around.

Farfetch is the premiere marketplace for luxury goods. And despite the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, it still has strong growth. More specifically, the company has trailing 12-month revenue growth of more than 80%. Going forward, analysts expect 36.6% growth in 2021 and 28.7% growth in 2022.

Despite this robust growth though, FTCH stock’s valuation remains relatively low. Shares trade at just 14.3 times forward price-sales. For a tech stock and online marketplace churning out these kinds of growth numbers, I’m surprised it’s not being valued more highly.

Plus, throw in China via Farfetch’s partnership with Alibaba and we have a recipe for even larger growth.

Speaking of Alibaba, I would be remiss if I left out China’s crown jewel of e-commerce from this list of growth stocks. In fact, scratch that — Alibaba is a crown jewel outside of China, too.

The company has taken a strategy similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). After building out a successful e-commerce arm, BABA began to expand. It continues to rack up assets (either via investments or created on its own) and it’s become a juggernaut in one of the world’s largest, fastest-growing economies.

China’s economy is second only to the United States, but with the way it’s growing and with its population — which is over four times the size of the U.S. — it’s only a matter of time before it becomes the largest.

Alibaba serves that population through its Amazon-like website. But the company also owns the other two most popular e-commerce sites in China: Taobao and Tmall.

Additionally, BABA has its own cloud business, as well as logistics and digital entertainment units. Plus, thile its investment in Ant Group didn’t go quite as planned thanks to a nixed initial public offering (IPO), it’s not something to write off either.

Ant was primed to make a record IPO before regulators stirred up some drama. But that negative short-term catalyst has a bright side: it created a nice buying opportunity in BABA stock.

Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo displayed on phone screen

I have been a big-time bull on Nvidia for one simple reason: this pick of the growth stocks is a building block for numerous growth themes of the future.

Nvidia doesn’t just make one or two commoditized components for industries seeing cyclical growth. It’s making crucial components for multiple industries that have long-term secular growth.

The company’s graphics processing unites (GPUs) are significantly better than its competitors’ units. Further, Nvidia caters to data centers and the cloud, autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs), gaming, graphics and high-powered computers.

None of these industries are going to disappear in the near future — they will simply continue to grow.

When NVDA stock corrected in Q1 2020, it only dipped to its 200-day moving average before erupting to new highs. While it’s been consolidating for months now, shares just hit new all-time highs, reaching $614.90 on Feb. 16. And you can look for the company to continue chugging higher, especially if it lands its prized acquisition of Arm. All in all, Nvidia’s numbers won’t quit. Covid-19 accelerated demand in 2020 and NVDA continues to sport impressive growth estimates moving forward.

Last on my list of growth stocks is Invitae, easily the most speculative name on here. I have written about Invitae sparingly over the last two years.

NVTA has such a promising business model in a budding industry, but its execution hasn’t been as reliable. That’s made it a hard investment to stomach. It’s volatility can be rampant at times.

The company’s biggest issue isn’t growth — in fact, there is so much opportunity for growth here that it’s insane. The genomics space is ripe with potential, as technology is finally allowing us to leverage the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve our health.

That’s exactly what Invitae is doing, using its technology to churn out results that otherwise wouldn’t be possible. The company’s work is incredible and it’s one reason why analysts expect almost 42% revenue growth next year.

If it delivers in-line results, Invitae could generate some $700 million in sales in 2022. So, like I said, growth isn’t the problem.

What is? Cash burn.

Put simply, the company does not generate a profit and it does not operate with positive cash flow. That’s not a deal-breaker necessarily, but at some point investors need to stop being diluted and the company needs to stop raising cash.

If Invitae can tighten up its cash burn and work its bottom line in the right direction, NVTA stock has the potential to be a huge winner in an emerging industry.

Spurred by increased pressure to become “green,” many more companies and governments will increase their utilization of renewable energy.

This is also likely to make batteries and grid management more important is the “electrification of transportation,” which in all probability will make electricity even more important and meaningfully more expensive over the longer term.

American Superconductor refers to these products as “new energy systems.” In Q3, the Grid unit’s sales increased 12% year-over-year. The company noted that the revenue of its “new energy systems” was “driven by… renewable projects in the United States, along with chip factories overseas. “ AMSC stock has surged over 200% in the last 12 months.

Stem Has Many Top-Notch Customers

Among Stem’s customers are the following very large customers: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), WalMart (NYSE:WMT), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), Raytheon (NYSE:RTX), Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP), and InterContinental Hotels (NYSE:ICE).

Stem reported that it had helped InterContinental Hotels “halt rising energy costs” in California. Harry Hobbs, an Area Director of Engineering for the company, said that Stem’s “real-time data..is the real differentiator” that allowed him to triple his return on investment, according to Stem.

Tough Competition and High Valuation

In addition to American Superconductor, Itron (NASDAQ:ITRI) and ESCO Technologies (NYSE:ESE) offer similar solutions to those of Stem. As the sector becomes more lucrative, much larger companies, such as General Electric (NYSE:GE) and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), could very well enter the sector.

At this time, Star Peak Energy is trading at a post-merger valuation, based on certain assumptions, of $5.5 billion. The company’s revenue came in at just $33 million last year, although it says that it expects its sales to jump to $147 million in 2021 and $347 million in 2022.

Still, based on the 2022 figure, STPK stock is trading at a pro-forma price-sales ratio of 16, which is quite expensive. Nevertheless, it’s less expensive than many of its SPAC peers, and the company, unlike most other SPAC names, expects its EBITDA to turn positive in 2022.

On the other hand, as I pointed out in a recent, previous column, the sentiment towards SPAC stocks has soured somewhat recently, increasing the risk facing Star Point Energy.

The Bottom Line on STPK Stock

Stem’s huge opportunity and its very impressive customer list outweigh the risk facing the shares at this point. Consequently, I advise growth-oriented, risk-tolerant investors to buy the stock.

110,2021-02-19T15:16:37+00:00,The 8 Most Expensive Stocks Worth Buying in 2021,"Investors usually don’t go looking for the most expensive stocks in the market. But, in recent years, that strategy actually has paid off well.

This has been a market that has focused on growth over valuation. Whether due to low long-term interest rate expectations, a savvy understanding of “megatrends” in key sectors, or something close to a bubble, investors haven’t sold the most expensive stocks at the top. They’ve generally kept buying.

Indeed, some of the market’s biggest winners of the past few years have been the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). None of those stocks looked particularly cheap to begin with. All the way up, skeptics (on occasion, myself included) voiced concerns about valuations, but long-term bulls have generated enormous returns.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It’s up for debate whether that trend holds. Again, with so many sectors offering explosive opportunities, there is a case for buying growth at almost any price. There’s an equally reasonable case that at some point, valuation has to matter, and that such a point is on the horizon.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

For investors who retain their optimism, there are expensive stocks (if not necessarily the most expensive stocks) that still can provide quality returns from this point. Here are eight of those potential winners:

Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) Cloudlfare (NYSE:NET) Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Snap (NYSE:SNAP) Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Most Expensive Stocks Worth Buying: Luminar (LAZR) Luminar (LAZR) sign with greenery around it

Source: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com

At this point, there are basically no growth stocks in the auto sector that are cheap. Investors are going to have to pay up for exposure to the growth of electric and autonomous vehicles. In that context, quality matters most.

And it seems like Luminar has one of the better stories in the group. The maker of lidar (light detection and ranging) technology seems to be the industry leader, having passed Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR). ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) revenue should allow the company to ramp revenue and possibly reach profitability before the AV trend kicks into high gear.

Story continues

Again, investors do have to pay up for the opportunity. Luminar has a market capitalization now over $10 billion, yet 2021 revenue likely comes in below $30 million. This story can go south in a number of ways. The long-term risk is competition. In the near term, a pullback across the sector wouldn’t be shocking given how many names (LAZR included) have posted triple-digit rallies over the last six months.

But as I wrote last month, investors who trust the market and the sector should have LAZR on their watchlists. That’s still the case at the moment.

Cloudflare (NET) A close-up of the Cloudflare (NET) logo at the company headquarters in California.

At 41,035x the consensus earnings per share estimate for 2022, NET looks not like one of the most expensive stocks in the market, but the most expensive stock.

Of course, that forward price-to-earnings multiple is inflated by the fact that earnings are expected to be so thin (two-tenths of a penny, to be precise). That aside, NET still does trade at 45x the consensus revenue estimate for 2021, one of the higher multiples in the market.

But this seems to be a story worth paying up for. Cloudflare’s cloud-based solutions combine content delivery with security. The former trend is growing nicely thanks to demand for streaming video and edge computing. The latter is obviously important in this day and age, with Cloudflare allowing corporate IT departments to extend their security off premise and into the cloud.

There are concerns. The first, as with so many stocks on this list, is whether even that impressive growth potential is priced in.

Second, Cloudflare’s business model is different from other software companies in that capital expenditures are rather high. Cloudflare’s network requires worldwide reach, and that in turn requires significant capital. Capex including capitalized software was $75 million in 2020, more than 20% of revenue. That proportion will trend down over time, but this is not a capital-light business like many other software plays.

Finally, 2021 guidance given last week did look a bit soft, with Cloudflare guiding for a deceleration of growth in 2021. As we’ve seen with smaller sector play Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW), top-line disappointments are punished. NET stock has fallen 10% in two sessions since the release.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

In other words, execution risk is high. But given the opportunity for Cloudflare to become an integral part of the internet worldwide, for now the risks seem worth taking.

Fastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.

FSLY is another name that shows the risk of disappointing in the CDN space. Investors bid the stock up aggressively from March lows, betting that the CDN provider would benefit from pandemic tailwinds. But preliminary third quarter numbers in late October were good but not quite good enough. Fastly stock plunged 27% the following day, and another 17% during a seven-session losing streak that followed.

But long term, Fastly seems fine. Those tailwinds are intact. Growth remains impressive. The case for FSLY is that its Q3 will in retrospect look like the stumble at Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Twilio has gained about 1,600% from 2017 lows.

FSLY isn’t likely to post those same kinds of returns, but there’s still upside ahead. Q4 earnings topped expectations, and guidance suggests another 30% increase in revenue in 2021.

At the moment, that report again doesn’t seem quite good enough, with Fastly stock down in after-hours trading. From here, it looks easily good enough to support the long-term case, and to make FSLY a potential buy on any further weakness.

Adobe (ADBE) Adobe (ADBE) logo on wall of corporate building.

A year ago, I wrote that ADBE stock was a buy until proven otherwise. Simply put, it hasn’t been proven otherwise.

Adobe earnings have remained strong despite pandemic impacts. Its Adobe Sign offers another potential growth opportunity, even if that business lags DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) in e-signatures. The company’s acquisition strategy remains on point, and management is solid.

Certainly, Adobe stock isn’t cheap. 43x this year’s consensus EPS estimate is a big multiple, one that makes ADBE one of the most expensive stocks in the large-cap group.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

But ADBE has seen a bit of a buying pause since August. That consolidation seems like it’s setting up another rally. Yes, the multiple is big, but Adobe simply is one of the best companies out there. ADBE stock shouldn’t be cheap, and it likely won’t ever be for a very long time.

Most Expensive Stocks Worth Buying: Bandwidth (BAND)

Source: Shutterstock

This relatively unknown CPaaS (communications-platform-as-a-service) provider has an intriguing bull case. Revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip, with a roughly 40% increase expected in 2020 and high-30s growth likely this year.

Certainly, the market isn’t ignoring BAND stock. Shares trade at about 14x 2020 revenue. But in the context of cloud names, that multiple isn’t completely out of line. Rival Twilio garners a far higher multiple.

Meanwhile, Bandwidth should be able to at least match Twilio on the top line. Bottom-line improvements should follow beyond 2021, thanks to operating leverage in the model and gross margin improvements. The technicals look solid, with BAND challenging resistance for a third time, setting up a potential breakout if Q4 earnings impress next week. Bandwidth even could be a takeover target down the line.

As with other cloud names, investors have to pay up for the potential here. But there’s a lot to pay up for.

Snap (SNAP)

Source: Puckpao / Shutterstock.com

Snap has gone from one of the market’s biggest disappointments to one of its biggest successes. In December 2018, SNAP stock touched $5, down more than 70% from its initial public offering price of $17. User growth had stalled out, the launch of Spectacles looked like a disaster, and investors simply had lost faith in the company.

In the 27 months since then, SNAP stock has returned more than 1,100%, including a 207% rally in 2020. Users have returned, social media is hot again, and Snap seems to be on the right track.

In short, investor confidence returned in a big way. As long as that holds, SNAP stock can keep rising. Yes, a 100x forward P/E multiple seems astounding. But Snap still has a lot of runway both in attracting new users, and more importantly, monetizing its existing base.

The nature of the platform model means a healthy chunk of that incremental revenue will drop to the bottom line. The resulting explosive earnings growth can justify that triple-digit P/E multiple in a hurry.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

Obviously, Snap must continue to execute. Just as obviously, the rally is going to slow. But as long as the status quo holds with the business, there’s room for more upside in SNAP as a stock.

Canada Goose (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket

Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com

I liked GOOS stock coming into 2021. Up 44% year-to-date, the stock still should have some legs.

Yes, the price is higher. But this isn’t a case of the market mindlessly bidding up the stock. Canada Goose’s fiscal third-quarter earnings report earlier this month was a blowout.

On an absolute basis, the quarter doesn’t seem that impressive. Revenue increased just 5% year-over-year. Operating profit actually declined.

But it’s how the quarter played out that cheered investors, who bid GOOS stock up 21%. The revenue growth was the first for Canada Goose since the pandemic hit. E-commerce sales impressed. China, a key export market, is returning to normalcy. Given that Canada Goose still has some stores closed, and is facing significantly lower traffic at third-party channels, even 5% growth looks like a win.

In short, this is a company that looks set to return to its growth trajectory. That projected trajectory was enough to push GOOS to $70 back in late 2018. If growth continues, there’s no reason it can’t get there again, which suggests roughly 60% upside from current levels.

Amazon.com (AMZN) Walmart's Robot Is Only a Minor Threat to Amazon Stock

Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com

AMZN stock long has had the reputation of being one of the market’s most expensive stocks. On a P/E basis, it’s often looked ridiculously inflated.

Interestingly, that’s actually starting to change. Looking to 2022, analysts now see EPS of $66 (albeit with a very wide range), suggesting a forward P/E multiple around 50x.

That figure sounds enormous. But I’ve long argued that investors shouldn’t use a single metric to value this company, and that’s still the case. It’s worth remembering that Amazon earnings remain deflated by the company’s enormous investments in all sorts of markets.

Some of those investments will pay off. Some won’t. But long term, those investments either provide a return, which boost profits, or get cut, which does the same.

Meanwhile, the cloud business is enormously valuable. Amazon’s dominance of e-commerce remains relatively unchallenged, even with smaller rivals doing well amid the pandemic.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

Simply put, this is one of the world’s best companies, yet AMZN stock is as cheap as it’s been in a while. Recent underperformance – AMZN stock has traded flat since July – isn’t likely to hold. The departure of chief executive officer Jeff Bezos could provide an overhang, but from a long-term perspective this pause in AMZN’s rally seems like a buying opportunity.

“The Chinese government and the Chinese partners insist on them taking most of the shares of any partnerships,” Parsa said in an interview. “I don’t think the balance is right at the moment.”

A representative for Tencent confirmed that it no longer has a partnership with Babylon and declined to comment further. Tencent backs a competing service, WeDoctor, whose business spans insurance policies, medical supplies and online-appointment booking.

Babylon’s app lets users schedule a video chat with a doctor, check symptoms or book time with specialists, such as therapists. A $550 million cash infusion led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in 2019 valued the company at about $2 billion. It put Babylon in a position to grow when the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, offering access to doctors from the safety of patients’ living rooms when many offices were closed, as well as a way for people who suspected they had the virus to track their symptoms.

Babylon said it will continue to expand in Asia, and has an agreement with Prudential Plc in the region offering its symptom checker and other products in markets including Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has pledged to take a harder stance against practices such as forced technology transfers that require foreign businesses to share technology and intellectual property in return for access to the Chinese market. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that this gives China an “unfair technological advantage.”

Still, Babylon’s main focus will be growing in the U.S. this year, Parsa said.

Growth Rate

Babylon’s U.S. partnerships and recent rollouts give it access to about 3.5 million patients, Parsa said. In January, the company hired Steve Davis, the former head of technology at Expedia Group Inc., as chief technology officer, and Stacy Saal, who helped build Amazon.com Inc.’s Fresh and Prime Now businesses, to help run the U.S. expansion.

Revenue is increasing about fourfold a year, and the company’s expecting to take in about $300 million in 2021, up from about $20 million in 2019. While Babylon is ready to go public, Parsa said he’s concerned about how the market would react to the company’s growth.

“But the pressure on us to go public, just because the public markets are flying right now, as you can imagine is significant,” Parsa said.

Parsa said the company is primarily focused on developing its AI, and is pushing forward with a plan to create an centralized “AI brain” that will integrate the different algorithms Babylon uses and help manage users’ health more holistically.

The company will ultimately be able to compare a member’s data -- combining publicly available information with data from smart watches and responses to a questionnaire -- to “everybody else who’s like you in the system” to predict how that person’s health will develop and intervene at a very early stage, he said.

AI Expansion

Still, the patient-facing AI that’s currently available, the symptom checker, has been the target of criticism that it’s capable of missing serious health problems. A dispute with one of its most vocal critics came to a head early last year when Babylon hit back against a U.K. doctor who’d been posting screenshots of what he said were errors in the app on his Twitter account. The company downplayed the mistakes, saying the doctor found only 20 occasions of “genuine” inaccuracies out of 2,400 tests.

While Parsa stands by the accuracy of the app, he said he ultimately isn’t “a big fan of the way we responded” to the critic. The trials exposed issues that have since been fixed, he said. Babylon’s also careful to say that the tool provides general information and not a medical diagnosis.

“This idea that AI is going to be amazing immediately is just a fallacy. AI is like every other technology it’s going to disappoint in the short term and it’s going to disappoint big time,” Parsa said. “And I think, more than any other technology, AI is going to surpass our wildest imagination in the long term.”

114,2021-02-19T13:32:40+00:00,Saudi-Backed U.K. Health App Babylon Ends Deal with Tencent,"(Bloomberg) -- Babylon Healthcare has pulled back from China, where it had a partnership with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, after the company “couldn’t come up with a commercially viable model,” Chief Executive Officer Ali Parsa said.

“The Chinese government and the Chinese partners insist on them taking most of the shares of any partnerships,” Parsa said in an interview. “I don’t think the balance is right at the moment.”

A representative for Tencent confirmed that it no longer has a partnership with Babylon and declined to comment further. Tencent backs a competing service, WeDoctor, whose business spans insurance policies, medical supplies and online-appointment booking.

Babylon’s app lets users schedule a video chat with a doctor, check symptoms or book time with specialists, such as therapists. A $550 million cash infusion led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in 2019 valued the company at about $2 billion. It put Babylon in a position to grow when the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, offering access to doctors from the safety of patients’ living rooms when many offices were closed, as well as a way for people who suspected they had the virus to track their symptoms.

Babylon said it will continue to expand in Asia, and has an agreement with Prudential Plc in the region offering its symptom checker and other products in markets including Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has pledged to take a harder stance against practices such as forced technology transfers that require foreign businesses to share technology and intellectual property in return for access to the Chinese market. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that this gives China an “unfair technological advantage.”

Still, Babylon’s main focus will be growing in the U.S. this year, Parsa said.

""We try to adjust and adapt Glassdoor's product over the years to the needs in the hiring marketplace. That's our business, to help people find jobs and companies that they love,"" said Glassdoor Chief Economist Dr. Andrew Chamberlain. He tells Yahoo Finance that the change in how the site breaks down job data has been years in the making.

""The needs of employers as they try to hire are really different today. Diversity, equity, and inclusion [DEI] are not just a fad that is coming and will disappear. It's not just a fad that showed up and will disappear again. It's here to stay. It's something that job seekers want to see. Real diversity, equity, and inclusion results by employers and employers want intelligence about how they are actually doing, and how their D&I goals are being realized and compared to their competitors."" Glassdoor website —Glassdoor

Glassdoor has collected approximately 800,000 demographic insights from 187,000 employees at more than 3,300 companies. Data shows that Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), AT&T (T), and Starbucks (SBUX) are among the companies with the most demographic information shared by employees.

The job site has spent the last few months gathering data on the Black experience at work. Its preliminary findings show that Black employees were less satisfied on average at their jobs, with a 3.3 rating compared to the 3.5 rating overall. However, Chamberlain tells Yahoo Finance that the ratings depend greatly on the company and industry.

Story continues

""There is no one universal Black experience at work. It really depends on company policies. And it depends on the local culture inside organizations. So we found even within the same industry, there are very big differences between how satisfied people are at work.""

Glassdoor says that it had sufficient data on 20 companies when it came to measuring the Black work experience, and the research showed that Apple has the highest overall rating among Black employees, which stands at a 4.2. Here's how the rest of the top 5 broke down: Bank of America (4.0), Capital One (3.9), Starbucks (3.9), J.P. Morgan (3.8).

“Whether you’re East Asian or South Asian, White, Black or LatinX, you’re coming into a workplace with really different cultural norms and experiences, and the insight of the diversity equity inclusion movement is that employers can do better ... if they let people be themselves at work and try to find ways to build a culture that’s inclusive and let's everyone be the most productive they can be and flourish at work and bring that cultural background with them rather than trying to force everybody into a monoculture where everybody has to talk the same and dress the same and do the same things, that’s the direction smart employers are headed and that’s what this product is designed to help them do.”

124,2021-02-18T20:37:14+00:00,Walmart Has a Real Growth Problem,"- By Panos Mourdoukoutas

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a real growth problem, according to Quo Vadis Capital President John Zolidis.

He thinks that the company's recent efforts to recast itself as a fintech incubator, health care provider, venture capital player or subscription service (via Walmart+) ignore the reality that all these efforts are miniature relative to the size of the base business.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with WMT. Click here to check it out.  WMT 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of WMT Peter Lynch Chart of WMT

""Our call is that assigning this business a hefty growth multiple (near the highest valuation in 17 years) is inconsistent with the real growth rate, which remains very modest and reflective of a mature business with margin headwinds,"" he said.

Zolidis' comments follow the release of Walmart's fourth-quarter financial report, which showed a 3% decline in Ebit and less than 1% earnings per share growth, well below the full-year growth of 11%.

Meanwhile, the retail giant lowered its 2021 earnings guidance due to the divestiture of profitable businesses. ""It's unclear whether the company is factoring in the benefit it will receive from another stimulus checks or other stimulus for its customers included in pending legislation,"" Zolidis said. Regardless, he doesn't see much growth ahead for the retail giant.

For years, Walmart grew by leaps and bounds by offering low prices that undercut smaller retail chains.

Then Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) came and lured shoppers away from brick-and-mortar stores to online avenues, bringing to a halt Walmart's growth.

But Walmart fought back by developing its own online business and leveraging its stores to expedite shipping and delivery of orders.

For a while, Walmart's strategy of merging online and offline sales have been working, helping the retail giant resume its growth, though it has yet to catch up with Amazon in most critical financial performance metrics:

Wall Street took notice, pushing Walmart's shares well above its GF Value.

The trouble is that the strategy of merging online and offline sales may be running its course, as evidenced by Walmart's recent financial reports and by a decline in its economic profit. That's why the company has been searching for growth opportunities outside its core business.

Company ROIC WACC ROIC-WACC (Economic profit) Walmart 9.08% 3.62% 5.46% Amazon 12.40% 7.58% 4.82%

But that won't be easy given the company's size, as Zolidis points out. He has a sell recommendation on the stock.

126,2021-02-18T19:48:07+00:00,Walmart just dealt a major blow to other retailers,"Walmart is putting its nearly $18 billion cash hoard to good use this year, and how it's spending it should absolutely scare the heck out of most other retailers.

Somewhat getting lost in the market's maniacal focus on Walmart's fourth quarter earnings miss on Thursday are two new aspects to the retailer that could help widen its competitive moat. While investors don't seem to care much about them today (shares are down 6% post earnings), it could seriously alter Walmart's future earnings power because of that strengthened market positioning.

First is the company's aggressive $14 billion capital investment plan for 2022. If that number is hit, it would mark a roughly $4 billon year-over-year increase from 2020. It would be the most capital Walmart has invested in its business since it spent $13.5 billion in calendar year 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

For a company really no longer building U.S. super centers and going gangbusters with international store expansion, the year-over-year increase is significant and indeed stands out. The way Walmart puts it, the large sum of money will be used to take its business operations to the next level to support the future of consumption.

""Around $14 billion with a focus on supply chain, automation, customer-facing initiatives and technology,"" Walmart said of its 2021 capital investment plan on its earnings release.

In other words, expect Walmart to continue to expand its same-day delivery reach (now live at 3,000 U.S. stores), bolster its online operations (think more functionality and selection) and improve warehouse efficiencies. Taken together, Walmart will likely get tougher to beat on merchandise prices and speed of service (among other areas) as a result of its spending spree.

""I don’t know that I see it as a veiled threat to any one direct competitor, but rather a very strong statement that Walmart isn’t going to lose to a near-field competitor,"" Jefferies retail analyst Stephanie Wissink tells Yahoo Finance of the capital investment number. ""And recognizing its power position — proximity to 90% of the U.S. population and THE #1 retailer for most vendors globally — it has a responsibility to be better, faster or a direct competitor could encroach upon that dominance, as we’ve seen already with Amazon and with Target.""

The second item that is being overlooked by investors is Walmart's decision to hike wages for workers.

Walmart said Thursday it's raising wages for 425,000 of its nearly 1.5 million employees. Yahoo Finance's Julia LaRoche first reported that wage for Walmart’s 425,000 store associates in the digital and stocking workgroups will increase to a range of $13 to $19 per hour, depending on location and market. The pay increase will take effect on March 13.

The pay hike will weigh on Walmart's profits this year, as suggested in its below consensus earnings outlook. But for the world's largest retailer, a generally happy workforce (because of higher compensation) is a good thing to have when they are being asked to do more tasks than in prior years (servicing online orders from stores, for instance). Higher paid workers will likely stay with Walmart longer, reducing the cost of doing business over time and improving productivity.

For retailers not named Walmart, well, this pay hike sucks for them. In effect, it could raise their costs of doing business and make their operations less efficient. And that could cause them to slip behind Walmart in key areas.

""We believe that Walmart's plan to raise wages could increase the competition for labor in areas where Walmart and the dollar stores are within close proximity,"" warned Jefferies analyst Randal Konik in a new note.

Why Is Bitcoin Soaring to New Highs?

Perhaps the biggest reason behind the recent Bitcoin rally is that major companies and investors are finally throwing their weight behind the cryptocurrency. Earlier in February, Tesla stunned the Wall Street when it announced that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and plans to start accepting the currency. Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones recently said that Bitcoin is just getting started and currently in its “first inning.” Jones also said that Bitcoin is the best inflation hedge. Twitter’s founder and CEO Jack Dorsey along with rapper Jay Z launched a Bitcoin development fund by investing 500 Bitcoins. Dorsey said that it will be a ""blind irrevocable trust"" focused on Africa and India. Square also recently bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin. All of these developments are causing Bitcoin to soar, as the currency gets legitimacy and acceptance across the board.

Bitnet Technologies is a San Francisco-based startup which Rakuten invested in shortly before announcing this decision. It has remained a strong supporter of the potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and was one of the first major companies to accept it as a form of payment.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: In a recent interview in the ""New York Times"" you said you would advise Mark Zuckerberg to implement an advisory board. Were you referring to the oversight board that just came out with its first ruling and will decide in a couple of months about whether President Trump should be allowed back on? And do you think he should be allowed back on?

BILL GATES: You know, Mark is, you know, I think a great person, really trying to maintain the great things about digital social networking and curb the hard ones. You know, most people don't have a really good solution of how you separate out the good and the bad and the role of government in the company. The oversight board, which I-- he might have been planning to do without-- was something that I suggested to him, that to get it out of, OK, what does Mark think? Rather, these are some eminent thinkers and in each country they may reflect the cultural values of that country. And so, you know, you're bringing them in with a sense of responsibility there.

I don't think banning, you know, somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes-- well less than a majority-- but, you know, I don't think having him off forever would be that good. You know, if he's spreading lies about the integrity of the election, does that need to be labeled? You know, is he actually less important in terms of causing trouble in the future than he was in the past? But it'd be kind of a shame if they have to use such an extreme measure when there are people who want to see debates around, you know, his views and splitting the digital world into, OK, here's this site that's, you know, for one party or part of one party, and here's another site for another one. That kind of polarization's probably not a good thing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bill-gates-facebook-banning-trump-150110737.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'IHSEF.US', 'MSFT.US', 'ORCL.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SNAP.US', 'SOCL.US', 'SPXL.US', 'SPXS.US', 'SPXU.US', 'TQQQ.US', 'TWTR.US']","['OVERSIGHT BOARD', 'PRESIDENT TRUMP', 'SOCIAL NETWORKING']","{'polarity': 0.908, 'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.103}"

136,2021-02-17T19:14:30+00:00,Coronavirus update: Biden administration increases vaccine doses to states; UK approves first human challenge trial,"The U.S. federal government continues to increase state allotments of vaccine doses, even as winter weather slows down shipments and delays appointments, especially in Texas where power outages are ongoing.

States should expect a total of 13.5 million vaccines next week, an increase from 11 million this week, with additional shipments directly to pharmacies and federally qualified health centers.

Meanwhile, the country awaits Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) vaccine authorization, which could come as early as the end of the month. But even with hopes pinned on the one-shot dose, White House COVID-19 Response Team coordinator Jeff Zients said Wednesday there won't be a sudden surge of vaccines available.

""There is not a big inventory,"" Zients said, adding that only a few million of the 100 million promised will be available by the end of June.

Zients said the administration is working with the company to determine how to ramp up production. Unlike the existing vaccines, J&J's is not based on a new technology and can likely use existing infrastructure.

Moderna (MRNA) announced Tuesday it is going to meet its production goals, with 100 million doses ready by the end of May, a month ahead of schedule, while doubling its monthly output to 40 million to 45 million doses per month beginning in April.

An additional 100 million doses will be produced by the end of July, instead of September, the company said in a statement. There has been some delay in the production process, based on an equipment issue with partner Catalent, that will be resolved in the short term and will not affect production targets, a Moderna spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.

The United States, meanwhile, has been ramping up vaccinations, with more than 55 million first and second doses administered, and more than 71 million have been distributed.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has begun to set up more vaccine sites and is staffing them with active military in a partnership with the Department of Defense. FEMA is designating small sites as those capable of completing 3,000 vaccinations per day, and larger sites handling double that amount. Large sites in New York and Texas have opened, and smaller ones in New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands are planned, officials said Tuesday.

The White House is in conversations with Amazon (AMZN), according to Politico, and has been approached by other technology companies like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and AirBnB (ABNB). The move marks a shift from recent Congressional attention on the tech sector's size and power.

Amazon, in particular, has been under fire for its treatment of warehouse workers throughout the pandemic. New York's Attorney General is suing the company for its alleged handling of worker safety issues and for retaliating when employees began to complain. The company preemptively sued to stop the lawsuit last week.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday during a briefing that the Biden administration is busy tackling response efforts since taking office last month.

""What (President Joe Biden) inherited was not enough supply, not enough vaccinators, not enough places for vaccinations to happen. Communities had been left to fend for themselves. And so, that's what he's been focused on and working on,"" Psaki said. LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 16: A COVID-19 vaccination site established in a partnership between the federal government and the state opened today at Cal State Los Angeles, one of two in the state and the first phase of an effort expected to spread to 100 sites across the nation. The CSULA site is co-run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state of California through the governor's Office of Emergency Services. The site is expected to have an ultimate capacity of administering 6,000 doses per day, although it opened Monday with just 3,000 doses. Gov. Gavin Newsom said, however, the site would reach the 6,000-dose mark by the end of the week at both the Los Angeles and a Oakland site. Shortages in supply have hampered vaccination efforts at county- and city-operated sites, but officials noted that the vaccines provided at the two FEMA sites will be in addition to the state's normal supply. We're committed to ensuring that everyone who wants a vaccine gets one,'' FEMA Administrator Bob Fenton said during a news conference at the CSULA site. Fenton noted that the site was chosen specifically for its accessibility to hard-to-reach communities, focusing on areas where minorities make up over 40% of the population, looking at other factors such as poverty, lack of housing or vehicle access.'' Cal State LA on Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021 in Los Angeles, CA. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images).

Variants and challenge trials

Even as vaccinations are on the rise, with more than 15% of the population inoculated, scientists are increasingly concerned as new variants emerge. The variant originally found in the U.K. (B.1.1.7) could be more deadly than the original strain, while the strains from South African (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1) are showing more resistance to vaccines -- though they remain effective in blocking some level of infection.

A new strain, with similar mutations to the B.1.1.7 strain, has already been reported in several countries, including in the U.S.

Meanwhile, the U.K. approved the first human challenge trials, to begin through OpenOrphan (ORPH.L) Wednesday. The company anticipates it can play a role in helping second generation vaccines which could target virus variants through an expedited clinical trial process.

The company has already looked at nasal spray vaccine options, which is of interest for individuals who cannot receive injected doses for health reasons. Cogenix and Altimmune are already testing candidates and are in early clinical trial stages. Other companies have also identified oral candidate options, which are similarly in early phases.

138,2021-02-17T18:10:04+00:00,Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs In The World,"In this article, we are going to list the Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World. Click to skip ahead and jump to the Top 5 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World.

Serial entrepreneurs start new companies, make them successful, and sell them to move on to their next startup. Serial entrepreneurship is on the rise in the U.S. Success stories of figures like Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Square founder Jim McKelvey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia, 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki and several others are fueling inspiration across the country among young people to launch startups. Data from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association suggest that venture capitalists invested a whopping $156.2 billion into domestic startups in 2020 alone.

Serial Entrepreneurship is a Tough Game

But starting and selling companies is not for everyone. Data from TechCrunch suggests that the chances of a startup being acquired at or after Series C are very small. To give you some context, making it to Series C is extremely difficult. TechCrunch’s report said that out of every 1,000 startups that successfully close a Pre-Series A funding round, only 400 make it to Series A.

Successful founders and venture capitalists are also helping startups grow and reach their goals. For example Jim McKelvey launched a startup accelerator SixThirty, which will back four financial-services startups each fall and spring and invest $100,000 a year.

Entrepreneurs who risk starting up a venture are rewarded with profits and growth opportunities if their idea becomes successful. But if their calculations and applications were not properly assessed, they could suffer great losses. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, takes risks repeatedly. A serial entrepreneur analyzes real problems and identifies the solutions for which a large number of customers are willing to pay. Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World

Unlike a traditional entrepreneur who prefers to build a company and stick with it until the end, a serial entrepreneur does not stop at a single venture. Steve Jobs is one of the perfect examples of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world. In 1976, college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computers Inc in a garage. In December 1980, Apple launched its initial public offering selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share. It was a massive hit by the end of the day, as the stock had increased in value by approximately 32%, leaving the company with a market value of $1.778 billion. Today, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) trades at $135.37 per share with a market cap of over $2 trillion. In 1985 Steve Jobs created NeXT, an operating system and business computer company which later on benefited the operating systems of Apple computers. In 1997, Apple bought NeXT for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. In 1986, the serial tech entrepreneur acquired the gold standard of the animated filmmaker, Pixar, for $5 million. In 2006, Jobs sold Pixar to Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) for over $7 billion. Today, Pixar Animated Studios is acknowledged as one of the world's most influential film studios.

The Antifragility of Serial Entrepreneurs

While chasing for success has always been the goal for many business founders, serial entrepreneurs are anti-fragile: they gain from failure. Studies show serial entrepreneurs have greater success than first-timers. As to the obvious reason, serial entrepreneurs have more experience in managing a business as it is natural for them to look for different ventures they could invest in. According to a Harvard Business School paper about ""Performance Persistence in Entrepreneurship"", serial entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed than first-time entrepreneurs or those who have failed in part because serial entrepreneurs ""exhibit persistence in selecting the right industry and time to start new ventures"".

Through the years, serial entrepreneurs have been perfecting their skills in building successful ventures. Another research to back it up was performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in which they observed thousands of startups over 25 years. The purpose of the study entitled ""Skill vs. Luck in Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital"" was precisely to understand whether the success of serial entrepreneurs stems from the skills they have perfected in their careers or from external factors. The study found that ""successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies"" and that ""skills are an important determinant of success for entrepreneurial start-ups"". The study also highlighted the key distinction between previously successful founders and formerly unsuccessful entrepreneurs: ""Entrepreneurs who have been successful in previous business are much more likely to succeed in current business than first-time entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs who have previously failed.""12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs

All evidence seems to point to the fact that one of the main skills of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world is to learn from their successes and failures to achieve more with their next venture.

140,2021-02-17T13:00:11+00:00,Amazon Go Rival Bets Pandemic Made Case for Cashierless Stores,"(Bloomberg) -- A startup selling Amazon Go-like checkout technology to retailers has raised money from investors at a $1 billion valuation, minting a new unicorn a year into a pandemic that has helped bolster the case for cashierless stores.

Standard Cognition Corp., based in San Francisco, offers a package of cameras and software that tracks browsing shoppers and automatically charges them when they exit. Circle K, the convenience store chain owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., is installing Standard’s technology in an Arizona store, with more to follow. Compass Group PLC, a U.K.-based food-service conglomerate, is also a customer.

“We’ve got commitments for 40 more stores on the books,” said Jordan Fisher, Standard’s co-founder and chief executive officer, who believes the pandemic has accelerated interest in cashierless technology. “We are really on the precipice of unleashing this on the world.” He said Standard will use $150 million in new funds to expand its installation team, among other things.

The startup has its roots in a geeky discussion group Fisher convened in New York when he worked at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The entrepreneurial crew would get together weekly to discuss cutting-edge research, sifting through areas that they could pursue if they ever uncovered an idea worth quitting their day jobs for.

By late 2016, they had settled on computer vision, which helps machines understand images, and decided to apply it to the checkout process. Days later, Amazon.com Inc. announced its first Go store in Seattle.

“Most of the team was like, ‘Oh, no. I guess it’s back to the drawing board,’” recalls Michael Suswal, Standard’s chief operating officer and one of seven co-founders.

The team decided to keep going, figuring there were plenty of retailers looking for automated checkout technology but wary of working with Amazon. “There's the elephant in the room, you don’t want to partner with your biggest competitor,” Fisher said.

Story continues

Standard participated in the Y Combinator startup accelerator in 2017 and opened a test store in San Francisco the next year, inviting shoppers and paid contractors to try and fool the technology. Over time it got better, thanks in part to the help of Scale AI Inc., a fellow San Francisco-based unicorn. Standard charges customers an upfront fee to cover the cost of the cameras and backroom computers, as well as a monthly fee. The company declined to disclose how much it charges.

Standard quickly emerged as the best funded of a crowd of startups seeking to use computer vision to help revolutionize retail, securing backing from such investors as CRV, formerly known as Charles River Ventures, Initialized Capital and EQT Ventures. The latest round was led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 and included contributions from existing investors as well as a few new ones. The injection brings Standard’s total outside investment to $236 million.

Standard deliberately chose a simpler approach than Amazon—relying solely on cameras and shunning shelf sensors—in a bet that stores would be able to install the technology without costly retrofits. But getting the systems installed and running smoothly has gone more slowly than expected, and the company expects to have the system in at least 100 stores by the end of 2021, well short of the thousands Standard had previously targeted in that time frame. (Amazon, which has opened about 30 of its own Go stores, fell short of a similarly ambitious internal target of thousands of locations.)

“We were definitely off the mark in appreciating how hard this was going to be,” Fisher said. “There is a huge barrier to entry here.”

Compass, which operates thousands of locations including canteens at Google headquarters, has installed Standard’s technology in three spots so far, including a convenience store at the University of Houston. Compass is hedging its bets by also testing Amazon Go’s “Just Walk Out” technology.

Scott Wu, chief technology officer of Compass’s retail research and development unit, is a believer in automated checkout but says it will take time for the technology to become ubiquitous. “The cost is still really high, because it’s new and not at scale yet,” he said. “When the technology is mature, and the price is at a point where its scalable, it will be everywhere.”

142,2021-02-17T12:29:42+00:00,Freeze Could Keep Texans in the Dark for Days: Energy Update,"(Bloomberg) -- The deep freeze that has forced the shutdown of U.S. refineries, oil wells and meat plants, disrupted shipments of soybeans and corn, and is still leaving more than 3 million customers without electricity could continue to keep parts of Texas in the dark for several days.

To prevent the collapse of their networks, suppliers from North Dakota to Texas implemented rolling power cuts for a second consecutive day, with outages spreading to more states including Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The operator of the Texas electric grid says it could take days for enough power plants to be up and running to restore supply. Utility CenterPoint Energy Inc. also warned residents blackouts may last for several more days.

In the Permian Basin, major producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. told customers it would be forced to curtail oil deliveries, while Chevron Corp. shut in some wells in the region. Fracking in the top U.S. shale plays has gone dark. U.S. oil production has plunged by a third.

Meanwhile, gasoline futures in New York jumped almost 5% on Tuesday as more than 20 refineries were disrupted by the polar blast. Citgo Petroleum Corp. said its Corpus Christ refinery in Texas won’t be able to deliver fuels. Wheat futures also surged as the freeze snarled grain shipments.

Amazon.com Inc. closed facilities in Arkansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana and Kentucky.

Oil Prices Hold Above $60 as Crisis Spurs Rush for Fuels (4:30 a.m.)

West Texas Intermediate futures held onto gains accumulated this week trading above $60 a barrel while Brent rose for a third day. U.S. gas futures traded near the highest for three months and contracts in Europe surged.

Temperatures in Texas are now low enough to freeze oil and gas liquids in pipelines laid on the ground. LNG exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Europe are expected to decline. Estimated gas flows to U.S. LNG export terminals are seen 63% below the previous week and at the lowest level since early September.

North Asian spot LNG spot prices halted losses as traders weighed the impact of disruptions at U.S. export projects. The cold weather is expected to continue until the weekend when temperatures will recover to near-normal levels.

Biden’s Grid Upgrade Plan Could Get Boost from Blackouts (3 a.m.)

Energy analysts and experts said the blackouts in Texas underscore the U.S. electric system’s need for more of almost everything, from additional power lines criss-crossing the country to large-scale storage systems that can supply electricity when demand spikes or renewable generation declines.

That could give at least a rhetorical boost to President Joe Biden’s plans for a “historic investment” in the nation’s electric grid, including better transmission systems and battery storage that would make the system more resilient amid extreme weather spurred by climate change.

Texas Power Outages Becoming Fodder in Green New Deal Debate (1 a.m.)

Politicians are using the widespread power outages as fodder in the debate over whether the government should back massive investment in clean energy and infrastructure.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has blamed intermittent renewable power sources for the blackouts, while the state’s agriculture commissioner said on Facebook that no wind turbine should ever be built in the state again. Both are Republicans.

Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back on Twitter, saying “the infrastructure failures in Texas are quite literally what happens when you don’t pursue a Green New Deal.”

Meanwhile one of Texas’s Senators, Ted Cruz, was reminded on Twitter of comments he made about California being “unable to perform even basic functions of civilization” during its blackouts last summer. He sheepishly responded:

“I got no defense. A blizzard strikes Texas and our state shuts down. Not good.”

Citi Sees Oil Refineries Recovering Faster Than Wells After Freeze (12 a.m.)

The Arctic freeze in the U.S. is set to cause a cumulative production loss of about 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 16 million barrels of oil, Citigroup analysts said in a report Tuesday. The loss could be bigger if the size and duration of disruptions exceed those during a similar event in February 2011.

While oil and gas production may rebound from the majority of wells in a week or two, it will take longer for output to recover from nearly all the wells. Meanwhile, processing facilities, including refineries and power plants, are likely to resume operations quicker. Still, the increase in energy prices caused by the disruptions could face headwinds and may remain “very volatile” over the next couple of days as shutdown of refineries and petrochemical plants boost inventories.

At Least 20 Dead in Winter Storm as Power Outages Continue (11 p.m.)

At least 20 deaths have been reported across the U.S. in connection with severe winter weather that has left millions without power, according to the Associated Press.

Three people were found dead after a tornado in North Carolina, and four others died in a Houston-area house fire after lighting a blaze in the fireplace to stay warm. Other causes of death included car crashes on icy roads and carbon monoxide poisoning.

Midwest Grid Operator Lowers Emergency Level After Ordering Blackouts (10 p.m.)

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. lowered its emergency level to a level that no longer requires rolling blackouts.

The grid had earlier asked all utilities in its southern region -- most of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Southeast Texas -- to implement periodic power outages after frigid weather forced generator shut-downs at the same time demand was rising.

Texas Warns Fuel Shortages Developing in Western Half of State (9:30 p.m.)

Motor fuels are running low in some parts of Texas as winter storms and frigid weather cripple power generation, natural gas output and the oil refineries that rely on them.

The shortages have been detected along a stretch of Interstate 10 between San Antonio and El Paso, the Texas Department of Transportation said in a tweet late Tuesday.

“Parts of Texas have fuel shortages,” the tweet said. “If you must drive, top off before you hit the road.”

Houston Suburbs Tell People to Boil Water Before Drinking (8:50 p.m.)

Officials in several Houston suburbs issued so-called boil orders warning residents to purify water supplies amid deepening weather and energy crises.

Water-pressure levels in some municipal systems west and south of the fourth-largest U.S. city have fallen so low that the water is no longer safe for human consumption, according to warnings from multiple districts late Tuesday.

The boil orders came just hours after office towers in the downtown business district warned tenants that low pressure meant the water was no longer potable. Power supplies across the state have been crippled by a combination of record cold temperatures and disruptions in fuel deliveries. Water utilities in Texas rely on electric pumps to operate distribution networks.

U.S. LNG Plants Begin to Delay, Cancel Cargoes (8:45 p.m.)

The Freeport liquefied natural gas export plant in Texas has delayed and canceled planned loading of several shipments over the next few weeks as the facility curbs output in response to the deep freeze. Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the three-train plant to dial back operations in keeping with the state’s disaster declaration.

Power disruptions at export facilities, closed ship channels and a reduction in the flow of natural gas have held back LNG tankers off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Crews are working to restore power to the Sempra Energy-owned Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc., the top U.S. LNG exporter, also curbed production at Sabine Pass LNG in Louisiana and Corpus Christi LNG in Texas.

Gas flows to U.S. LNG export facilities have dropped to the lowest level since early-September, according to data from BloombergNEF.

Midwest Grid Operator Declares Rolling Blackouts in Southern Regions (7:45 p.m.)

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., which runs the largest power grid in the U.S. Midwest, called for rolling blackouts across its entire southern region amid generation outages and high demand. The order is scheduled until 1 a.m. on Feb. 17.

MISO operates a system that stretches along the Mississippi River region from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico, taking in 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.

Houston Power Outages Could Last Several Days, CenterPoint Says (6:05 p.m.)

Rolling blackouts that have paralyzed Houston and the rest of Texas may last for several more days, utility CenterPoint Energy Inc. warned residents.

With too little electricity being generated to supply all demand in the fourth-largest U.S. city, CenterPoint said in a tweet that it has no way to predict when supplies will be restored.

Canadian Gas Commands Rare Premium Over U.S. Fuel Amid Freeze (5:49 p.m.)

A deep freeze that’s sent Texas power prices surging and curtailed millions of barrels of oil production is serving as a short-term boon for Canada, which is fetching a rare premium for its natural gas.

The country’s benchmark AECO gas price traded at a 27% premium to its U.S. equivalent on Tuesday, just days after touching a 7-year high of $5.28 per million British thermal units, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Canadian gas usually sells at a discount to American supplies because of its distance from major population and manufacturing centers, among other reasons.

U.S. Oil Output Plunges by a Third as Freeze Slams Permian (5:32 p.m.)

Total U.S. oil production has plunged by nearly a third as an unprecedented cold blast freezes well operations across the central U.S., according to traders and industry executives with direct knowledge of the operations.

Crude output has now fallen by about 3.5 million barrels a day or more nationwide, they said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Before the cold snap, the U.S. was pumping about 11 million barrels a day, according to last government data. Production in the Texas’s Permian Basin alone -- America’s biggest oil field -- has plummeted by as much as 65%.

Operations in Texas have stumbled because temperatures are low enough to freeze oil and gas liquids at the well head and in pipelines that are laid on the ground, as opposed to under the surface as practiced in more northerly oil regions. The big question now is how quickly temperatures return to normal.

It Could Take Several Days to Restore Power in Texas (5:20 p.m.)

The operator of the Texas electric grid no longer expects all service to be restored in the state by Tuesday night, saying it could take days for enough power plants to be up and running.

One of the chief hurdles is that there isn’t enough natural gas flowing to fuel plants, Bill Magness, chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said in a briefing. He expects “significant progress” in the next several days but warned more power plants could still trip offline.

“We are seeing progress on restoration of the system,” Magness said. “There could be setbacks”

Earlier Tuesday, grid officials said they expected all power to be restored by the evening.

You can skip our discussion of Tor Minesu's investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance and go directly to Former SAC Capital PM Tor Minesuk's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2021.

Founded in 2017, Tor Minesuk's Mondrian Capital Management saw massive gains in 2020, thanks to big investments in fastest-growing companies from information technology, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors. Its all top ten positions outperformed the broader market returns in 2020. Despite that, the hedge fund has made several changes in its 13F portfolio during the fourth quarter to align the stock positions according to the changing market trends.

The New York-based hedge fund has initiated positions in 17 stocks during the fourth quarter including the largest positions in ServiceNow (NASDAQ: NOW) and Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ: QRVO) and Adobe Inc (ADBE). In addition, Tor Minesuk has also added to its 10 existing positions.

The hedge fund likes to take advantage of short-term price movements instead of holding positions for the long term. The firm sold out its 20 stock positions during the fourth quarter and reduced its stake in 9 stocks.Former SAC Capital Portfolio Manager Tor Minesuk's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2021

Tor Minesuk, who also worked for Ken Griffin's Citadel for more than 2 years, has sold its entire stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) during the fourth quarter after initiating the position during the second quarter of 2019. The firm has benefited from its MSFT stake because shares of the tech giant rallied significantly in the past couple of quarters.

Similarly, the firm also took advantage of MongoDB, Inc (NASDAQ: MDB) share price gains by selling its entire stake in the fourth quarter. MDB accounted for 4.27% of the overall portfolio at the end of the third quarter. The New York-based hedge fund had created a position in MongoDB in the fourth quarter of 2018 when it was trading below $100. MDB shares are currently trading around $420 level.

Besides past performance, Tor Minesuk continues showing confidence in technology, communication, and media companies. The investments in information technology stocks accounted for 75% of the overall 13F portfolio, according to the latest fillings. Consumer discretionary sectors represent 11% of the portfolio while investments in communication sectors stand around 6% of the portfolio. The majority of the companies in the fund’s portfolio are large-cap stocks.

While Tor Minesuk's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter's stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 111 percentage points. (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Let’s start examining former SAC Capital portfolio manager Tor Minesuk's top 10 stock picks for 2021 to determine whether these positions have the ability to outperform the broader market returns in 2021.

10. JD.Com (NASDAQ: JD)

Tor Minesuk's strategy of initiating a position in the Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) at the beginning of 2020 worked for his hedge fund. This is because shares of JD rallied more than 100% in 2020 and extended the upside momentum into 2021. Mondrian Capital Management has increased its stake by 13% in JD.com during the fourth quarter.

Argosy Investors, which generated 29.8% in select accounts in 2020, highlighted the strong business strategies of JD.com in an investor’s letter. Here’s what Argosy Investors stated:

“JD.com has been making conscious decisions to break its business up into its component parts, which in our opinion helps surface the value of each business. JD’s enterprise value is about USD $120 billion today. JD spun off its JD Health business worth USD $28 billion (like Teladoc in the US), may spin off its JD Cloud business (similar to AWS in the US), has sold shares in its JD Logistics business and is shooting for a valuation of USD$40 billion in 2021 via an IPO, and JD Digits which provides supply chain and consumer loans was expected to be valued at nearly USD $30 billion before Ant Financial was prevented by the Chinese government from completing its IPO. The combined values of these business segments within JD is about $98 billion, leaving $22 billion for JD’s core retail business (and its cloud business) which is on track for over USD $100 billion in sales this year and growing over 20% per year. Assuming a 5% long-term margin for JD Retail, that segment is generating USD $5 billion of operating profit (EBIT). Given their strong market position, investors could value JD’s retail business alone at 20x EBIT, valuing JD retail at $100 billion. By comparison, Amazon was valued at over $175 billion during the year in which it earned USD $100 billion in revenue, so we continue to believe JD is being undervalued, despite a more competitive environment with Alibaba in China than Amazon faces in the US.”

9. Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: ADI)

You can skip our discussion of Tor Minesu's investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance and go directly to Former SAC Capital PM Tor Minesuk's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2021.

Founded in 2017, Tor Minesuk's Mondrian Capital Management saw massive gains in 2020, thanks to big investments in fastest-growing companies from information technology, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors. Its all top ten positions outperformed the broader market returns in 2020. Despite that, the hedge fund has made several changes in its 13F portfolio during the fourth quarter to align the stock positions according to the changing market trends.

The New York-based hedge fund has initiated positions in 17 stocks during the fourth quarter including the largest positions in ServiceNow (NASDAQ: NOW) and Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ: QRVO) and Adobe Inc (ADBE). In addition, Tor Minesuk has also added to its 10 existing positions.

The hedge fund likes to take advantage of short-term price movements instead of holding positions for the long term. The firm sold out its 20 stock positions during the fourth quarter and reduced its stake in 9 stocks. Former SAC Capital Portfolio Manager Tor Minesuk's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2021

Tor Minesuk, who also worked for Ken Griffin's Citadel for more than 2 years, has sold its entire stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) during the fourth quarter after initiating the position during the second quarter of 2019. The firm has benefited from its MSFT stake because shares of the tech giant rallied significantly in the past couple of quarters.

Similarly, the firm also took advantage of MongoDB, Inc (NASDAQ: MDB) share price gains by selling its entire stake in the fourth quarter. MDB accounted for 4.27% of the overall portfolio at the end of the third quarter. The New York-based hedge fund had created a position in MongoDB in the fourth quarter of 2018 when it was trading below $100. MDB shares are currently trading around $420 level.

Besides past performance, Tor Minesuk continues showing confidence in technology, communication, and media companies. The investments in information technology stocks accounted for 75% of the overall 13F portfolio, according to the latest fillings. Consumer discretionary sectors represent 11% of the portfolio while investments in communication sectors stand around 6% of the portfolio. The majority of the companies in the fund’s portfolio are large-cap stocks.

While Tor Minesuk's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017.

10. JD.Com (NASDAQ: JD)

Tor Minesuk's strategy of initiating a position in the Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) at the beginning of 2020 worked for his hedge fund.

The coronavirus crisis widened income inequality across the globe. According to World Bank, just like every pandemic in the past, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic would be severe for low-income countries. But contrary to the common belief, the list of modern billionaires includes several names who made game-changing products and services that solve key problems of humankind. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s CEO Jeff Bezos, whose total worth stands at over $180 billion, changed the world with Amazon, sowing the seeds of the ecommerce boom that is creating thousands of jobs daily. On March 16, Amazon said it would create 100,000 full- and part-time jobs across its Operations network. Similarly, other billionaires like Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL)'s Larry Ellison, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT)'s Jim Walton, Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s Larry Page and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class A (NYSE: BRK.A) Warren Buffett became rich not by exploiting others but by offering excellent products and services for which people are happy to pay money.

Dating app Bumble Inc (NASDAQ: BMBL) founder CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd recently became the world’s youngest self-made woman billionaire after BMBL stock soared following IPO. Similarly, the 40-year billionaire Toby Lutke created wealth when he launched tools to help online sellers create e-commerce stores. His company Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP) is used by thousands of sellers to sell their items online.

Billionaires in the U.S. get a lot of attention worldwide, but in this article we are going to take a look at the billionaires across the border.

According to the World Economic League Table 2021, Canada ranked as the 9th richest economy in the world. In 2020, it recorded its GDP per capita of $1.5 billion. Despite the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Canadian economy increased by 1.9% in Q3 2020, according to Trading Economies. The growth in the economies of the country's major trading partners, favorable mortgage rates and government policies contributed to the growth in the country's GDP. The Conference Board of Canada predicts that the country's GDP will grow by 5.3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022.

Story continues

The unemployment rate in Canada rose to 0.6% points in 2021, according to data from Trading Economies. Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, and the slow growth of the Canadian economy, Canadian billionaires have gained more wealth during the pandemic. Data from Forbes show that the Thomson Family witnessed the most growth, with an $8.8 billion increase. CEO of Shopify, Tobi Lutke, also saw a $6.6 billion increase. In the CCPA(Canadian Centre for Policy Alternative) report, Alex Hemingway, an economist and public finance analyst, highlighted the increase in the net worth of billionaires in Canada despite the increase in the unemployment rate. He said:

""At the same time as billionaires like Loblaws owner Galen Weston have seen their wealth balloon, front-line workers stocking shelves and scanning groceries at his stores have continued to risk their health and that of their loved ones by coming into work,”

Just like other parts of the world, the richest people in Canada actually saw their income boost during the coronavirus crisis. However, despite rising inequality, these billionaires have created jobs and contributed to the revenue of the country, directly or indirectly. Through their business activities, they contribute significantly to the growth of the Canadian economy. In our list of 15 Richest People in Canada, some of these billionaires are media personalities, CEOs, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, ecommerce merchants etc. Some of them are self-made billionaires, while others inherited their brands from family members.

In this article, we will assess the 15 richest people in Canada by their net worth. We used recent data from Forbes to calculate the most accurate estimate.15 Richest People In Canada

How? Well, the company did this by using a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). That is, there was a merger into the shell company Oaktree Acquisition Corp.The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.

During the first week of trading, HIMS stock was choppy. However, shares has since been on a nice rally — going from $15.68 to above $22.

Additionally, with the SPAC, HIMS was able to raise $280 million. About $75 million came from a private placement from investors like Oaktree clients and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN). And before this, the company had raised $158 million in venture capital.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As a whole, HIMS operates a telehealth platform as well as a digital pharmacy. The company is also working on a 300,000 square foot distribution center. Overall, though, the market value of the firm is currently about $4.26 billion.

So, what now for HIMS stock? Is it a good bet for this year?

7 Must-Own Stocks in February

Well, let’s dive in and take a closer look.

Background on the Company

Collectively, HIMS is a fairly new company. Back in late 2017, Andrew Dudum and Jack Abraham started the operation. They did this through their own venture capital firm, Atomic.

In the first week, HIMS generated $1 million in sales — and would finish the year at $27 million. No doubt, the company nailed the proverbial product-market fit.

At first, the focus was on providing telehealth services, such as for erectile dysfunction and hair loss. But HIMS would quickly expand its platform. And in 2018, there was the launch of Hers.

That said, there was also moves into categories like mental health, dermatology and primary care. To help with the management of the growing organization, HIMS created its own EHR (Electronic Health Record) system.

Moreover, the company’s service is primarily focused on Millennials and the Generation Z cohorts, who do not have insurance. The business model involves a subscription that is about $20 to $30 per month. Yet, the main revenues come from the sales of prescriptions.

Story continues

Now, HIMS is not completely virtual. The company has partnered with a variety of health care operators — such as Ochsner Health, Mount Sinai Health System, and Privia Health — to provide access to in-person visits with doctors.

And yes, the market opportunity is truly massive. The spending on prescription drugs comes to about $600 billion a year — and as for primary care, its about $280 billion (according to Deloitte and Grand View Research).

However, there are some nagging issues with HIMS stock. First of all, by relying on the sale of drugs, this could mean more pressure to make prescriptions, even if they are not needed. Next, there are the competitive pressures. There are a variety of startups gunning for the telehealth opportunity. But mega tech companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and traditional players like CVS (NYSE:CVS) could be major factors as well.

And finally, the valuation on HIMS stock is on the high side. Consider that the price-sales (P/S) ratio is about 30 times.

Bottom Line on HIMS stock

The growth story at HIMS has been standout. For 2020, the sales are expected to have increased by 66% to $138 million. And as for this year, the forecast is for $179 million and $233 million for 2022.

The company is also realizing economies of scale. For example, the gross margins have climbed to 71%.

Of course, with the novel coronavirus pandemic, the telehealth market has quickly gone mainstream. Healthcare providers are comfortable with the approach and insurance providers see this as an efficient option. As a result, the public companies in the sector have posted robust gains, such as Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) and American Well (NYSE:AMWL).

Momentum investing is one of the most fundamental quantitative investment strategies for investors seeking profit. Basically, it is the strategy of buying high and selling even high. The term is similar to Newton’s first law of motion which states that when an object is in motion it tends to stay in motion unless a force is applied to it. In relation, a market in motion tends to stay in motion. Basically, trends tend to continue.

The strategy dates back to 2004, when Chicago-based fund manager, Richard Driehaus turned the practice into a strategy. Although he was not the first to use the strategy, he is often called the father of momentum investing. He started buying stocks that already had good price moves and holding on to it as long as the upward price movement continues. He emphasized his discipline in selling the losers as soon as he sees a downward trend and re-investing the money in others upward trend stocks.

Investing in the time of an economic recession can be one of the hardest decisions for an investor given the market volatility. In the contrary, momentum investing goes against the market by taking advantage of positions in rising stocks and selling them the moment they show signs of going down. A momentum investor is more attracted to stocks that have rising prices as an upward trend may seem most likely in a certain period of time. The idea is based on the possibility of a stock that establishes a trend will continue in that direction rather than go against it.15 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Now

If an investor has the ability to identify sectors quickly and accurately, investing in momentum stocks can offer a great chance to gain a winning trade and take profits higher than regular trading opportunities over a short period of time. For instance, in a study by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman covering the US stock returns between 1965-1989, momentum was a significant factor that generated an outperformance of as much as 12.01% per year on average. In a separate study by Grundy and Martin in 2001, where they used NYSE and AMEX listed stocks, it was concluded that momentum profits were stable even after adjustment for dynamic risk exposure.

In order to create the list of the best momentum stocks to buy now, we used our in-house hedge fund sentiment data. Our research has shown that by using the hedge fund sentiment data, we can identify a small group of stocks that can outperform the S&P 500 index on average by double digits annually. For instance, the portfolio for stock picks for our monthly newsletter has beaten the market by over 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see details here) Some of the portfolio choices for our monthly newsletter were also publicly shared on our website. In October, we posted this real estate stock since then it’s been up more than 60 percent.

Based on our hedge fund sentiment data, we present to you the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now among 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:

15. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

No of HFs: 67

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.17 Billion

TSLA is the 15th best momentum stock to buy now. At the end of September, a total of 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider purchased 1,250 shares at around $767 in February 2020. The stock is up 10% since then. Baron Opportunity Fund mentioned TSLA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, and energy storage solutions. The company reported robust second quarter results, solidly ahead of market expectations, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macro-economic challenges. Indeed, in the second quarter, Tesla delivered almost 91,000 total vehicles – with strong unit level economics of 25.4% GAAP automotive gross profit margins – and another quarter of GAAP profitability and solid free cash flow (above $400 million). Moreover, Tesla recently announced a record of nearly 140,000 total vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. Despite global COVID-19 disruptions, our long-term expectations remain high due to Tesla’s differentiated products and healthy unit economics. Tesla has announced capacity expansions in Shanghai, China; Berlin, Germany; and Austin, Texas to support its short-term path to 1 million vehicles and its long-term goal of 20 million. Just a couple of weeks ago, Tesla held its Battery Day event, and presented a grand vision around its battery innovation and expanding its competitive advantages, including massively increasing internal battery production capacity (100 gigawatt-hours by 2022 and 3,000 by 2030), improving battery range (about 50%), and significantly lowering battery costs (cost per kilowatt-hour to decline by over 50%). We remain confident that Tesla will leverage its brand, technology leadership, and the electric vehicle secular trend to achieve sustainable long-term growth.”

14. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.21 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $840 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1,000 shares at around $78 in April 2020. The stock is up 80% since then. L1 Capital International Fund mentioned NKE in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“We reduced our investment in Nike. Nike is performing extremely strongly in a challenging operating environment, gaining share and exceeding our expectations. However, the market has recognised Nike’s strong performance and after a substantial increase in the share price we consider the risk adjusted return potential only warrants a minimum position size.”

13. Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.70 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Dan Loeb’s Third Point which had $645 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 26,784 shares at around $226 in November 2020. The stock is up 4% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned DHR in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Danaher, which designs, manufactures, and markets life science, diagnostics, dental, environmental, and applied solutions, is a prime example of how to use the business strategy of “bolt-on” acquisitions. Led by capital allocation experts the Rales brothers, Danaher will purchase a company in a fragmented industry, create a strategic platform for providing a unique service, and then spin off the company when it can create even more value as an independent entity.

Since Danaher’s bolt-on acquisition of the biopharma business of General Electric’s Life Sciences division for $21.4 billion in March 2019, we have realized a gain of well over 100%. The move boosted Danaher’s stock from around $90 (our purchase price) to the $210s. A gain like this is one of the big upsides of investing in a serial acquirer.”

12. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO)

No of HFs: 80

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.97 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock.

An insider recently purchased 100 shares at around $537 in December 2020. The stock is up 6% since then. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned NVDA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”

“When Qualcomm was trading in the low $50s, we bought every share we could. Qualcomm stock rose to around $70 when Broadcom was set to acquire the company, but ultimately the deal did not go through. In April of this year, Qualcomm ended a lengthy and complicated legal battle with Apple over the licensing of Qualcomm’s chip technology in Apple’s mobile devices, including its iPhones. The settlement included a payout from Apple to Qualcomm rumored to be around $6 billion, as well as a six-year licensing agreement and a supply agreement guaranteeing that the chipmaker continue to provide its products to the largest company in the world. With this settlement and the expected increase in product shipments, Qualcomm anticipates an incremental earnings per share of $2. As Qualcomm shareholders, we were able to realize a gain of 54% over a short period of time.”

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth.

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of investing in high growth stocks paid off in 2020 as his 8 out of the top ten positions outperformed the broader market index. Indeed, the majority of his top 25 positions generated better performance than the S&P 500 index in 2020, thanks to investments in information technology, financial services, and consumer discretionary stocks. His investment firm has also been holding positions in fast-growing companies from the healthcare and communications sectors.

In addition to investing in the fastest-growing companies, the firm also likes to buy depressed stocks that have strong fundamentals. The firm believes in the demand and supply idea when it comes to pricing any stock. Fisher Asset Management, which is employing several teams of research analysts for finding the best investment opportunities, created positions in 118 stocks during the fourth quarter.

In addition, the firm likes to hold a stake for the long-term to benefit from share price gains and dividends. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s asset management firm added to its 388 existing positions during the fourth quarter.

The average time held for the top ten stocks stands around 11.6 quarters while the time held for the top 20 stocks averages around 13.65 quarters.

Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management

Founded in 1979 and incorporated in 1986, Fisher Asset Management ended the fourth quarter with $133 billion in 13F portfolio market value, up significantly from $114 billion in the previous quarter and $98 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Ken Fisher is the heart and soul of Fisher Asset Management and currently serving as the executive chairman and co-chief investment officer. He is the son of legendary investor Philip A. Fisher. Ken Fisher is also a columnist and author. He has written several books on finance.

Story continues

While Ken Fisher’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start examining billionaire Ken Fisher’s top ten stock picks to determine returns in 2020 and what are the future prospects of these positions. Its top ten stock holdings account for almost 32% of the overall portfolio.

10. Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM)

The customer relationship software developer Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is the tenth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. The firm has benefited from its large position because shares of CRM rallied almost 28% in the last twelve months compared to the S&P 500 growth of almost 17%.

Alger Spectra Fund also believes that Salesforce is a good stock to buy and hold for the long-term. Here is what Alger Spectra Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

Polen Capital also talked about CRM in its Q4 investor letter:

“We discussed Salesforce.com in the third quarter, but the former went from our top contributor last quarter to the largest detractor this quarter. The double-digit share price decline in the quarter seemed mostly driven by investor reaction after Salesforce announced it would acquire Slack, a collaboration software company, for approximately $28 billion, a high purchase price. While the purchase price is higher than we expected, we believe Slack and its functionality fit well strategically with Salesforce’s suite of enterprise software offerings. At a high-level, Slack offers the ability to make both Salesforce’s and other third-party applications work better for their respective customers. In addition, Salesforce’s world-class selling organization and already large customer base should be beneficial for Slack’s subscription revenue growth, which has been more customer-referral based up to this point. It is too early to know if this acquisition will prove to be a smart allocation of investor capital. That said, Slack has a unique value proposition and was growing nicely on a standalone basis. We believe the Salesforce-Slack strategic vision is on point; and although the purchase price is high in absolute dollars, it represents less than 15% of Salesforce’s market capitalization.

We maintain an optimistic view of Salesforce’s business, its competitive positioning within enterprise software, and the rationale behind the Slack acquisition. We expect strong, continued earnings and free cash flow growth many years into the future.”

9. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE)

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of holding a position in Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has also added to its performance in 2020. Shares of Adobe rallied 34% in the last twelve months, thanks to strong demand for its products. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.18% of the overall portfolio.

Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors stated in an investor’s letter that Adobe is likely to perform well despite pandemic related challenges. Here is what Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors said:

“We purchased Adobe, the leading provider of content creation software. Adobe is a software company with a recurring revenue stream, which should insulate it from some of the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

Polen Capital also talked about ADBE in its Q4 investor letter:

“Adobe has been a strong performer since our initial purchase in early 2016 and has since compounded annually over 40%. This year has been no exception, with the business performing superbly and the stock appreciating by over 50%. CEO Shantanu Narayen stated, “This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe.” In addition to consistent and recurring double digit revenue growth, its margin expansion has significantly boosted its earnings power. Non-GAAP operating margins have expanded by over 550 bps in the past year. At the same time, we also believe that CEO Narayen deserves more credit for his capital allocation prowess. He has made sound acquisitions that have boosted the value proposition of his company’s products while strengthening the competitive advantages of the business.”

8. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surged almost 40% in the last twelve months on the back of increasing demand for digital ads. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 2.19% of the overall portfolio.

Giverny Capital Asset Management LLC claims that Alphabet needs to be disciplined in its spending. Here is what Giverny Capital Asset Management stated in an investors letter:

“Alphabet is our largest holding. We’re biased, but we’d argue that Alphabet is reasonably priced. It earns significant profit from travel-related searches, which are way down this year. Travel spending figures to roar back at some point, possibly soon. Alphabet also spends extravagant amounts on R&D and capital spending as it finances younger ventures. Those other businesses, which include YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars and cloud computing centers, plus research in artificial intelligence, should eventually generate meaningful returns for shareholders. Or at worst, they will consume less investment over time. If Alphabet simply exercises discipline over investment spending for a few years as travel advertising rebounds and the core search business grows, the resulting free cash flow should generate satisfactory returns for owners.”

7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM)

The chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best performing stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. This is because shares of TSM jumped 135% in the last twelve months. In addition, the firm has also been bagging big dividends from Taiwan Semiconductor. The company offers a dividend yield of 1.31% despite strong share price gains in the last twelve months.

First Eagle Investment Management claims that Taiwan Semiconductor is set to expand its market share in the days ahead. Here is what First Eagle Investment Management stated in an investors letter:

“Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) traded higher during the quarter on signs that its total addressable market was poised to expand. Intel announced that it was facing delays in the manufacture of its next-generation chips and may contract out the work to third parties, opening the door for a large-scale chip “foundry” like TSMC to pick up some of the business. Foundries make chips designed and named by other companies; TSMC already produces certain chips for Intel.”

6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA)

Despite concerns over regulatory issues, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) stock price managed to outperform the broader market index. Shares of Alibaba are up 21% in the past twelve months, meaning Fisher Asset Management has benefited from its stake. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.43% of the overall portfolio.

Polen Capital Management, a value-driven, concentrated, long-term investment management firm, highlighted few stocks including Alibaba in an investor’s letter. Here is what Polen Capital Management stated:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier-one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

158,2021-02-12T21:34:48+00:00,"Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm Protest Nvidia’s Acquisition of Arm Ltd.","(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s largest technology companies are complaining to U.S. antitrust regulators about Nvidia Corp.’s acquisition of Arm Ltd. because the deal will harm competition in an area of the industry that is vital to their businesses.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are among companies worried about the $40 billion deal and are urging antitrust officials to intervene, said people familiar with the process who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. At least one of the companies wants the deal killed. Nvidia shares fell as much as 3.1% in New York trading on Friday.

The acquisition would give Nvidia control over a critical supplier that licenses essential chip technology to the likes of Apple Inc., Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and China’s Huawei Technologies Co.

U.K.-based Arm is known as the Switzerland of the industry because it licenses chip designs and related software code to all comers, rather than competing against semiconductor companies. The concern is that if Nvidia owns Arm, it could limit rivals’ access to the technology or raise the cost of access.

Nvidia has argued that the purchase price alone means it has no incentive to mess with that neutrality but some rivals and Arm customers are unconvinced.

“As we proceed through the review process, we’re confident that both regulators and customers will see the benefits of our plan to continue Arm’s open licensing model and ensure a transparent, collaborative relationship with Arm’s licensees,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “Our vision for Arm will help all Arm licensees grow their businesses and expand into new markets.” Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Arm declined to comment. CNBC reported Qualcomm’s objections earlier.

Before the deal can close, Nvidia must get through a long review process by antitrust officials in the U.S., U.K., European Union and China. Government agencies globally are in the process of reaching out to those they believe may be affected by the transaction.

Story continues

A groundswell of opposition from large tech companies may make it difficult to win approval, delay the process or force concessions that change the value of Arm to Nvidia. This is also a risk for SoftBank Group Corp., the current owner of Arm. The Japanese conglomerate has been trying to sell some assets to pay down debt and buy back stock.

In the U.S., the deal is under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which has opened an in-depth investigation of the merger and has sent information demands to third parties, according to a person familiar with the matter. The FTC declined to comment.

The changing leadership of the FTC could make winning approval tougher for Nvidia. The commission is generally split 2-2 along party lines at the moment, with Democratic commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter holding the acting chair position. Power will shift to the Democrats when U.S. President Joe Biden picks two candidates to fill an open seat and the seat held by Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who has been nominated to take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Deals like Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm, known as vertical mergers, are typically seen as less worrisome in the eyes of antitrust enforcers because the companies don’t compete head to head. But that view has come under fire from advocates of more aggressive antitrust enforcement who say regulators have downplayed the competitive harm from such deals.

Slaughter’s elevation signals a tougher approval process for vertical deals. Before taking over the agency, Slaughter criticized new guidelines issued last year by the FTC and the Justice Department outlining how the agencies would evaluate vertical deals. She said the guidelines overemphasize the potential benefits of such mergers and are “inexplicably mute” about the harms.

In December, Slaughter and Chopra said companies should no longer rely on the guidelines as an indication of how the FTC will police vertical deals.

“Moving forward, we need to aggressively enforce against the harms of vertical mergers,” they wrote. “We look forward to turning the page on the era of lax oversight and to beginning to investigate, analyze, and enforce the antitrust laws against vertical mergers with vigor.”

159,2021-02-12T19:58:12+00:00,Why Investors Should Avoid Northern Genesis Stock,"Lion Electric, which manufactures electric vans and buses, has agreed to merge with Northern Genesis Acquisition (NYSE:NGA) a special acquisition company (or SPAC), by the end of the current quarter. Given the high valuation of NGA stock, along with the tough competition that Lion will face, the fact that it has not yet made very deep inroads in the market, and the recent skepticism about SPACs, I believe that investors should avoid Northern Genesis for now. two businessmen shaking hands with peers at their side

Further, although Lion has a significant amount of potential, I think that there are a few much more promising EV stocks investors should buy instead.

Valuation of NGA Stock Is High

According to Northern Genesis’ investor presentation, about 195 million shares of Lion’s stock will be issued, based on certain assumptions. Since NGA stock was recently trading around $24, that works out to a pro forma valuation for Lion’s shares of about $4.6 billion. After subtracting the cash the company will receive and adding the debt it has to the valuation, the total enterprise valuation comes to about $4.24 billion.

That’s a pretty high valuation for a company that, as we’ll see, does not have many top-notch customers, did not generate much revenue last year and is facing fairly tough competition.

8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double

Moreover, two EV companies that I believe are much better positioned than Lion – Ayro (NASDAQ:AYRO) and Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp. (NASDAQ:SOLO) – trade at much lower valuations. Ayro and Electrameccanica have market capitalizations of $287 million and $838 million, respectively.

Further, CIIG Merger Corp. (NASDAQ:CIIC), a SPAC set to merge with Arrival, is also trading at a high valuation. But since Arrival appears to be truly disruptive, I think that CIIG stock is also better positioned than NGA stock. I’ll have more to say about Ayro, Electrameccanica, and Arrival later in the column.

Tough Competition and Little Market Penetration

Start-up Proterra, German giant Daimler (OCTMKTS:DDAIF) and Chinese giant BYD (OCTMKTS:BYDDF) are just a few of the heavyweight companies already looking to enter the global bus market. (Proterra has agreed to merge with another SPAC, ArcLight (NASDAQ:ACTC).) Further, as I mentioned in a previous column on Proterra, state and local governments may not, due to budgetary constraints, have a great deal of money to spend on procuring electric buses in the coming years.

The electric delivery truck market seems even more crowded, as Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS), Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), BYD, Daimler, Rivian, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are some of the major companies already in or looking to penetrate that market.

Of the customers for Lion’s trucks that the company identified on its presentation slides, I only initially recognized Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). A third customer, garbage collector Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN), has a market capitalization of$25 billion.

Amazon appears to be potentially interested in buying 2,500 trucks from Lion from 2021 to 2025, but that doesn’t yet appear to be a done deal. Also worth noting is that Lion only expected to generate $29 million of revenue in 2020 and $204 million this year.

SPAC Skepticism

In recent weeks, skepticism appears to have mounted toward SPAC names in general and SPACs that have agreed to merge with EV companies in particular. Many pundits are starting to warn that SPACs are overvalued and dangerous.

For example, earlier this month, Fortunecalled SPACs “a lousy deal for investors,” while the headline published in a Jan. 21InvestorPlace column, written by Mark R. Hake, proclaimed “Don’t Buy Overvalued and Speculative SPACs Like IPOD Stock.”

Given these points, I expect most highly valued EV SPACs, including NGA stock, to slide significantly, at least for the next month or two.

SOLO, AYRO and CIIC Are Much Better Deals

I’ve pointed out in previous columns that Electrameccanica’s Solo EV is a great fit for cost-conscious millennials. The company said multiple companies were interested in purchasing Solos. And way back in 2018, before the EV craze really began, the company announced 64,000 preorders for its EVs.

For its part, Ayro has strong partnerships with Ingersoll Rand’s (NYSE:IR) Club Car and Gallery Carts, a huge food-cart maker, that have already gotten off the ground. Moreover, Ayro’s niche of electric food-delivery and electric food trucks appears to have much less competition.

As a bonus, AYRO stock and SOLO stock have been much hotter than NGA stock recently. And, they don’t have the SPAC label, which seems to have become a stigma in the last several weeks. As I noted earlier, they’re both much cheaper than Northern Genesis.

CIIC stock also trades at a rather high valuation. But given the exceptionally low cost and low prices of Arrival’s EVs, the company is truly disruptive. This makes the shares definitely more attractive than Northern Genesis.

The Bottom Line on NGA Stock

The shares are quite expensive, while Lion is facing tough competition and investors are becoming more skeptical about SPACs. Although the deal with Amazon is encouraging, Lion does not have a very strong presence in the EV truck market. Finally, there are a few much better stocks to buy in the EV sector.

On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in Ayro, SOLO and CIIC.

Since I last wrote glowingly about the company in mid-November, the stock is up 104%. KSS stock is currently trading around $49.58 a share, a market capitalization of $7.8 billion on expected 2021 revenue of $15 billion. That assumes the January quarter comes close to the expected $5.9 billion. Image of Kohl's (KSS) logo on a Kohl's store

Key to the rise is CEO Michelle Gass, as I wrote when the move began in November. Since joining the company from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in 2018, she has shown a willingness to try things.

Wall Street likes that. Heck, I like that.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Gass’ Big Moves

Before Gass arrived, Kohl’s was a discounter selling clothes and home goods. It lived in big strip mall locations, somewhere between Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Target (NYSE:TGT).

Gass has been breaking the stores up and has brought in full price merchandise. She set out a section for Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), which had lost its sporting goods channel to bankruptcy. She set up a section for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) returns. She rented out parts of her stores to Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT).

8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double

Since the post-pandemic reopening, Gass has made more moves. She launched agreements with Land’s End (NASDAQ:LE) and, more recently, privately owned Eddie Bauer. She has also partnered with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) Sephora chain, which had previously been signed with the failed JC Penney.

The result is an updated version of the old department store, only with brands running the departments, and a substantial e-commerce effort. Online now represents about one-third of revenues. All Kohl’s stores now pack-and-ship Amazon returns and Gass says this has increased visits.

Stepping on Gass

The key to a fatter stock price will be a profit, something analysts expect to see for January, when results are announced March 2. The official estimate is about $150 million, or 97 cents per share, but the “whisper number” they’re giving out over drinks is $1.05 per share, which would be over $160 million. Before the pandemic hit, Kohl’s earned $265 million in its Christmas quarter.

Story continues

Bullish analysts expect a big fiscal 2022, with sales growth of 17%, and profits of $2.62 per share. That would be enough to bring back the dividend, which was suspended during the pandemic but was previously 70 cents per share. If it can hit analysts’ earnings estimates, KSS stock would have a forward price to earnings ratio of just 18.

But there remain bears. Of 15 analysts now following Kohl’s at Tipranks, seven have it rated as a buy, seven as a hold and one is saying sell. More importantly, their average price target of $42.57 is about 14% below Kohl’s current price.

The Bottom Line on KSS Stock

Despite Kohl’s rising stock price, Michelle Gass still has doubters.

While Target and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have focused on creating high-quality store brands, Kohl’s is closely tied to brand names. While Gap Stores (NYSE:GPS) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) focus their big strip mall locations on off-price, Kohl’s is going upscale in similar real estate. While most stores consider Amazon their enemy, Kohl’s has made it a friend.

The coming year will say a lot about this strategy. The upper middle class will be released from their work-at-home confinement with money to spend. Kohl’s is betting it can become essential to their new decade lifestyle. I think they’re right, but even if I’m not, I think Gass will adjust.

165,2021-02-12T16:33:58+00:00,S.F. Express Merger With Kerry Logistics Creates Logistics Powerhouse,"S.F. Express, the top integrated logistics company in China is expanding globally to compete with established titans FedEx (NYSE: FDX), UPS (NYSE: UPS) and DHL, and analysts say this week's investment in Kerry Logistics gives it the firepower to be a one-stop shop for logistics services.

The addition of an international freight forwarder deal immediately vaults S.F. Express to the top echelon of ocean freight management companies and one of the leading warehouse, trucking and e-commerce providers in Asia. And S.F. Airlines gives Kerry Logistics Network Limited (OTC:KRRYF) access to airfreight capacity that is in very short supply.

Parent company SF Holdings had $3.4 billion in gross revenue in 2019 and Kerry Logistics' sales were $5.3 billion. The combined company will be the second largest third-party logistics provider in Greater China behind Sinotrans at $11 billion, according to data from Armstrong & Associates.

Brittain Ladd, an e-commerce consultant who was an executive at Amazon, called the tie-up ""an ideal fit.""

S.F. Holdings, the largest courier, expedited shipping and e-commerce operator in China — and the primary delivery provider for online shopping giants Alibaba Group and JD.com — on Wednesday announced plans to acquire a 51.5% stake in Hong Kong-based Kerry Logistics for HK$17.5 billion ($2.3 billion).

Once that is complete, the combined companies will be a dominant logistics provider in Asia. S.F. Holdings had nearly 115,000 employees and $17.4 billion in sales as of May, according to Forbes. About a half million independent couriers deliver packages for S.F.

The merger reflects the ongoing consolidation in China's logistics sector due to the growth in e-commerce. Business-to-consumer package volume was forecast to grow about 15% per year before the coronavirus pandemic greatly accelerated the trend. Online shopping platform Alibaba's logistics arm, Cainiao, is also rapidly expanding its service offerings and geographic footprint with a strategy that resembles that of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the U.S. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) has reduced its reliance on S.F. Express since 2017.

""Frankly, we don't have a global footprint at this moment; we are in only about 20% of the countries that DHL and FedEx are in. In 10 years, I believe we will have at least comparable capability to the big three [DHL, FedEx and UPS],"" Assistant CEO Eddie Huang said in a November 2019 interview with McKinsey & Co. Cracking the international freight management business takes longer because of long-term existing relationships between many cargo owners and their logistics providers, he acknowledged.

""Our long-term aspiration is to make the logistics service almost zero-cost for our customers,"" Huang said.

Kerry Logistics

Kerry Logistics will become S.F. Express' international arm, operating under an asset-light model common among freight forwarders. Toward that end, the cash deal requires Kerry Logistics to sell off its Hong Kong warehouses and its entire business in Taiwan to parent company Kerry Group, a conglomerate controlled by Robert Kuok, one of the richest men in Southeast Asia. Kerry Group holdings include malls, hotels, media, commodities and real estate.

After starting as a local contract logistics provider focused on the garment and textile industries, Kerry has grown into a global multimodal freight forwarder and one of the top asset-heavy logistics providers in Asia, with extensive capabilities in e-commerce, merchandising, last-mile fulfillment, trucking and brokerage. It has locations in 59 countries and territories and 52 million square feet of warehouse space, logistics centers and port facilities worldwide.

Much of Kerry's international growth, especially in Southeast Asia and Europe, has come since becoming a publicly traded company in 2013. It has acquired freight forwarders in Spain, Italy, Germany, Africa, Turkey and the U.S. A joint venture with Dubai-based GlobalLink Logistics DWC LLC, expanded its coverage in Central Asia. Last March, Kerry completed the acquisition of U.S.-based Apex, the third largest ocean freight consolidator in terms of volume from Asia to the U.S.

Kerry Logistics currently ranks as the fifth largest ocean freight forwarder with 1.25 million TEUs handled annually.

Its international freight forwarding division accounts for 52% of revenues, with the rest generated by value-added warehousing and distribution. The Greater China region generates about 50% of Kerry's gross revenues, according to analysis by Milwaukee-based Armstrong & Associates.

Kerry Logistics generated revenue of more than $5 billion in 2019 and is the largest logistics company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

""Kerry specializes in serving companies in industries that are expanding rapidly in Asia like consumer product goods, retailers, electronics, fashion brands and food companies, making Kerry Logistics a vital part of the SF business,"" Ladd told FreightWaves. ""Combining both companies makes strategic sense.""

In addition to domestic express delivery, S.F. Holding Co.'s services in China include freight transport, cold chain, international express, warehouse management, sales forecasting, intra city delivery and supply chain management. S.F. in 2019 bought Deutsche Post DHL's supply chain division in China.The combined entity will have a very large warehousing network in China.

S.F.'s in-house airline has the largest freighter fleet in China, with 57 all-cargo aircraft flying to more than 60 cities at home and abroad, including Los Angeles and New York. Kerry, which has been expanding more into airfreight, will be able to take advantage of the partnership to get access to airlift that is difficult to secure secure with about a quarter of the international passenger fleet still grounded due to the downturn in travel caused by COVID-19, Armstrong & Associates President Evan Armstrong said.

S.F. Express is scheduled this year to begin operating a new hub for its air network at Hubei International Airport, in central China. The hub will increase the company's ability to make faster deliveries. It includes two runways, a 24,000-square-meter warehouse, an apron with 124 aircraft parking slots and offices. S.F. is targeting 3.3 million tons of cargo by 2030.

In China, 12-hour delivery for parcels will be the standard in five years, Huang predicted.

S.F.'s international logistics services are concentrated on moving products in and out of China. Kerry's network will enable the company to operate within other markets.

In 2017, S.F. Express and UPS established a joint venture to provide international delivery services initially from China to the U.S. Through the agreement, the parties agreed to leverage their networks, service portfolios, technologies and logistics expertise.

Under the proposed division of labor, Kerry Logistics will be responsible for international operations for the combined group, while S.F. focuses on China, Hong Kong and Macau. Kerry Logistics will be represented on the board, according to the announcement.

In December, Kerry Logistics announced it will build a 538,000-square-foot bonded, refrigerated warehouse in the Hainan free trade zone

The Chinese government last summer issued a master plan for the Hainan to be a major port by 2050, with certain categories of goods to enjoy zero tariffs and taxes. Imported goods with more than 30% value-added processing in the trade zone will be exempt from tariffs when sold to other areas in China. Shopping is tax-free on Hainan Island up to certain limits. Kerry Logistics provides logistics services for two duty-free shopping centers in Hainan and recently won contracts to do the same for three newly registered malls. Company officials have expressed confidence in duty-free consumption in Hainan, attracting duty-free e-commerce shipments.

S.F.'s acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, which is expected to take six months, officials said.

166,2021-02-12T16:33:58+00:00,S.F. Express Merger With Kerry Logistics Creates Logistics Powerhouse,"S.F. Express, the top integrated logistics company in China is expanding globally to compete with established titans FedEx (NYSE: FDX), UPS (NYSE: UPS) and DHL, and analysts say this week's investment in Kerry Logistics gives it the firepower to be a one-stop shop for logistics services.

The addition of an international freight forwarder deal immediately vaults S.F. Express to the top echelon of ocean freight management companies and one of the leading warehouse, trucking and e-commerce providers in Asia. And S.F. Airlines gives Kerry Logistics Network Limited (OTC:KRRYF) access to airfreight capacity that is in very short supply.

Parent company SF Holdings had $3.4 billion in gross revenue in 2019 and Kerry Logistics' sales were $5.3 billion. The combined company will be the second largest third-party logistics provider in Greater China behind Sinotrans at $11 billion, according to data from Armstrong & Associates.

Brittain Ladd, an e-commerce consultant who was an executive at Amazon, called the tie-up ""an ideal fit.""

S.F. Holdings, the largest courier, expedited shipping and e-commerce operator in China — and the primary delivery provider for online shopping giants Alibaba Group and JD.com — on Wednesday announced plans to acquire a 51.5% stake in Hong Kong-based Kerry Logistics for HK$17.5 billion ($2.3 billion).

Once that is complete, the combined companies will be a dominant logistics provider in Asia. S.F. Holdings had nearly 115,000 employees and $17.4 billion in sales as of May, according to Forbes. About a half million independent couriers deliver packages for S.F.

The merger reflects the ongoing consolidation in China's logistics sector due to the growth in e-commerce. Business-to-consumer package volume was forecast to grow about 15% per year before the coronavirus pandemic greatly accelerated the trend. Online shopping platform Alibaba's logistics arm, Cainiao, is also rapidly expanding its service offerings and geographic footprint with a strategy that resembles that of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the U.S. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) has reduced its reliance on S.F. Express since 2017.

""Frankly, we don't have a global footprint at this moment; we are in only about 20% of the countries that DHL and FedEx are in. In 10 years, I believe we will have at least comparable capability to the big three [DHL, FedEx and UPS],"" Assistant CEO Eddie Huang said in a November 2019 interview with McKinsey & Co. Cracking the international freight management business takes longer because of long-term existing relationships between many cargo owners and their logistics providers, he acknowledged.

""Our long-term aspiration is to make the logistics service almost zero-cost for our customers,"" Huang said.

Kerry Logistics

Kerry Logistics will become S.F. Express' international arm, operating under an asset-light model common among freight forwarders. Toward that end, the cash deal requires Kerry Logistics to sell off its Hong Kong warehouses and its entire business in Taiwan to parent company Kerry Group, a conglomerate controlled by Robert Kuok, one of the richest men in Southeast Asia. Kerry Group holdings include malls, hotels, media, commodities and real estate.

After starting as a local contract logistics provider focused on the garment and textile industries, Kerry has grown into a global multimodal freight forwarder and one of the top asset-heavy logistics providers in Asia, with extensive capabilities in e-commerce, merchandising, last-mile fulfillment, trucking and brokerage. It has locations in 59 countries and territories and 52 million square feet of warehouse space, logistics centers and port facilities worldwide.

Much of Kerry's international growth, especially in Southeast Asia and Europe, has come since becoming a publicly traded company in 2013. It has acquired freight forwarders in Spain, Italy, Germany, Africa, Turkey and the U.S. A joint venture with Dubai-based GlobalLink Logistics DWC LLC, expanded its coverage in Central Asia. Last March, Kerry completed the acquisition of U.S.-based Apex, the third largest ocean freight consolidator in terms of volume from Asia to the U.S.

Kerry Logistics currently ranks as the fifth largest ocean freight forwarder with 1.25 million TEUs handled annually.

Its international freight forwarding division accounts for 52% of revenues, with the rest generated by value-added warehousing and distribution. The Greater China region generates about 50% of Kerry's gross revenues, according to analysis by Milwaukee-based Armstrong & Associates.

Kerry Logistics generated revenue of more than $5 billion in 2019 and is the largest logistics company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

""Kerry specializes in serving companies in industries that are expanding rapidly in Asia like consumer product goods, retailers, electronics, fashion brands and food companies, making Kerry Logistics a vital part of the SF business,"" Ladd told FreightWaves. ""Combining both companies makes strategic sense.""

In addition to domestic express delivery, S.F. Holding Co.'s services in China include freight transport, cold chain, international express, warehouse management, sales forecasting, intra city delivery and supply chain management. S.F. in 2019 bought Deutsche Post DHL's supply chain division in China.The combined entity will have a very large warehousing network in China.

S.F.'s in-house airline has the largest freighter fleet in China, with 57 all-cargo aircraft flying to more than 60 cities at home and abroad, including Los Angeles and New York. Kerry, which has been expanding more into airfreight, will be able to take advantage of the partnership to get access to airlift that is difficult to secure secure with about a quarter of the international passenger fleet still grounded due to the downturn in travel caused by COVID-19, Armstrong & Associates President Evan Armstrong said.

S.F. Express is scheduled this year to begin operating a new hub for its air network at Hubei International Airport, in central China. The hub will increase the company's ability to make faster deliveries. It includes two runways, a 24,000-square-meter warehouse, an apron with 124 aircraft parking slots and offices. S.F. is targeting 3.3 million tons of cargo by 2030.

In China, 12-hour delivery for parcels will be the standard in five years, Huang predicted.

S.F.'s international logistics services are concentrated on moving products in and out of China. Kerry's network will enable the company to operate within other markets.

In 2017, S.F. Express and UPS established a joint venture to provide international delivery services initially from China to the U.S. Through the agreement, the parties agreed to leverage their networks, service portfolios, technologies and logistics expertise.

Under the proposed division of labor, Kerry Logistics will be responsible for international operations for the combined group, while S.F. focuses on China, Hong Kong and Macau. Kerry Logistics will be represented on the board, according to the announcement.

In December, Kerry Logistics announced it will build a 538,000-square-foot bonded, refrigerated warehouse in the Hainan free trade zone

The Chinese government last summer issued a master plan for the Hainan to be a major port by 2050, with certain categories of goods to enjoy zero tariffs and taxes. Imported goods with more than 30% value-added processing in the trade zone will be exempt from tariffs when sold to other areas in China. Shopping is tax-free on Hainan Island up to certain limits. Kerry Logistics provides logistics services for two duty-free shopping centers in Hainan and recently won contracts to do the same for three newly registered malls. Company officials have expressed confidence in duty-free consumption in Hainan, attracting duty-free e-commerce shipments.

S.F.'s acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, which is expected to take six months, officials said.

167,2021-02-12T14:40:41+00:00,"Jumia Shows Some Great Potential, but JMIA Stock Is Really Stretched","Jumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA), which operates an e-commerce platform and mobile payments system in Africa, has suddenly become a darling on Wall Street. Note that JMIA stock has gone from $8 in September to about $65. The market capitalization is roughly $5.8 billion. Jumia (JMIA) banner at the New York Stock Exchange

The company was smart to capitalize on this run-up. In early December, Jumia pulled off an “at the market” offering of shares, raising $243.2 million. This was certainly critical as the balance sheet needed a boost.

About eight years ago, Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec started Jumia. They both had extensive experience working a McKinsey, such as for clients on areas like e-commerce and packaged goods.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

This proved to be spot-on for developing Jumia, and the founder had little trouble raising money. While growth was strong in the early years, the company would ultimately get overextend forcing Jumia had to leave various countries as well as cut back on costs.

8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double

But despite all this, the platform is still robust. Jumia has 6.7 million annual active consumers and 110,000 active sellers. The platform also has a wide array of top brands like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Unilever (NYSE:UL), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). This has been key for generating engagement.

For the most part, the African market has been neglected by the large e-commerce players. Instead, the focus has been more on India and parts of South America.

Yet Africa is certainly an attractive opportunity. The population is 1.3 billion and there are 523 million Internet users. Consumer spending is over $4 trillion. There are also 17 million small and medium-sized businesses.

The Jumia Stock Growth Story

Growth has been choppy for Jumia. During the latest quarter, the GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) was actually down 28% on a year-over-year basis to 187.3 million euros, but it is important to keep a few things in mind.

Story continues

First of all, Jumia has been changing the mix of its product line towards higher-margin items and has streamlined the business model. Next, the company has been taking steps to realize efficiencies. In fact, a big part of this has been the leveraging of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In other words, the strategy is to pursue profitable growth. And for the most part, the company is getting results. In the quarter, there was a 22% improvement in gross profits on a year-over-year basis.

Something else to note: The mobile payments business is showing lots of momentum. As seen with the companies like Square (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), this can be a lucrative category – and can be big in terms of driving shareholder value. In the quarter, Jumia reported its payments platform grew by 50% to 48 million euros.

Bottom Line on JMIA stock

The hope is that Jumia will become the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa. Yet this is probably too optimistic. If anything, as the African market starts to show more progress, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) will probably target the opportunity. Such companies do not necessarily need to be first-movers to get a big share of the market.

Besides, when it comes to JMIA stock, it looks as if the valuation is stretched. Of course, we’ve recently seen speculative activity come into the markets, such as with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC).

JMIA stock is trading at a nose-bleed 26 times revenues, so it’s probably best to hold off and wait for a more reasonable valuation for the time being.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: Now let's turn now to that conversation on podcasts. We're joined now by Doug Imbruce, founder and CEO of Podz, and Yahoo Finance's Melody Hahm. So Doug, I don't want to spend too, too much time because there's so much interesting stuff to get into here. But I'm hoping for everyone at home if you can explain a little bit how Podz works.

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, sure, so it's funny. You know, Melody wrote the other day about sort of the golden age of audio. And while it is a golden age and we're seeing more podcasts being produced than ever by these really thoughtful, incredibly knowledgeable creators, for consumers, it doesn't feel much like a golden age because the process of discovering podcasts and using these decades old directories, it really-- it hasn't changed. And if you look at the data, it sort of supports this gap. We're only more than-- about 1% of podcasters reach more than 5,000 listeners.

And so, at Podz, we thought we could sort of transform the discovery of podcast content with a really modern experience that basically matches the kind of experience you have when you use apps like TikTok and Instagram and Snap and automatically transforms podcasts into a personal feed of highlights that you can enjoy and save full episodes to listen later. So we're just trying to grow the audience for podcasts overall and help people fit this amazing medium into their digital-- busy digital lives.

MELODY HAHM: Doug, there is a humorous component to this moment, right? Because it's basically radio, what we're listening to. And Podz is essentially creating snippets of compelling conversations, and you can go deeper, right? You can choose to listen to a full episode in-app. What do you make of this structural shift back to perhaps the '80s, when podcasting first started, and that it feels like perhaps the innovation has actually been stunted and that there isn't any new territory to really explore?

Story continues

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, no, I mean, look, it's a great point. If you look at every other medium, it has been digitally transformed. So, right? When text was was brought online, Twitter basically took the idea of long blog posts and transformed it into these short 140-character tweets by building a platform around creative limits. TikTok did the same thing in video, Instagram via their photo filters. But to your point, that same transformation has not happened in podcasting. And we think it's limiting growth.

MELODY HAHM: You know, Doug, looking at the space with a lot of this consolidation that's happened, Spotify is the player to beat, right, when it comes to content creation and also the pipes as well. As I understand it, Podz now hosts about 5,000 podcasts. You've been able to aggregate some of that manually, some of that with big data. But you don't have original podcasts on the platform.

Believe it or not, I'm sure everyone watching knows that Joe Rogan from the Obamas to Brené Brown, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, they are all Spotify original podcasts. How are you able to make sure you can have all of the premium high quality content on the platform when there seems to be more of this race to get creators to be sort of tied to individual platforms?

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, you know, it's unfortunate that everybody talks about the big names in the space with these incredibly lucrative deals who typically have either pre-existing platforms. You know, either they're sort of media personalities or existing celebrities that Spotify pays to create original exclusive content that goes behind Podify-- Spotify's paywall.

Because, you know, as sort of we dig into the industries ourselves, as a company that wants to disrupt the experience of podcast consumption, there's just so many other incredible creators that nobody is talking about. And we hope, similar to the way, again, companies like TikTok and Instagram and Twitter created platforms that allowed creators to be elevated and built these incredible network effects through these really modern experiences, that we can bring that same approach to podcasting.

And hopefully next time we speak, you'll be talking about, you know, the long tail of incredible creators. And we don't have to keep people's attention focused on Joe Rogan because I don't want to live in a world where everybody listens to only Joe Rogan every day.

KRISTIN MYERS: So that brings me to a question that I have to ask you, which is about Clubhouse. You know, Melody and I were listening to a chat that you were doing yesterday on that app. I mean, as you were mentioning, there's so many content creators out there. They're are inking those really big deals. But there's, as you said, tons of content creators that no one has even heard about. So how does an app like Clubhouse really turn that industry on its head and kind of change the game for the audio-only industry?

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, I mean, it's unfortunately, in Clubhouse, I think you're seeing a lot of the same dynamics sort of take shape. Because while Clubhouse is an incredibly powerful tool for live broadcasting, the discovery experience inside an app like Clubhouse, where you load the feed and sort of the most popular rooms appear first, it just seems like kind of an echo chamber, similar to-- you know, the same kind of personalities that are appearing in traditional podcasting.

You know, again, apps that really help this-- us discover this long tail-- again, Twitter, TikTok-- those, to us, are models that are far more exciting. Not to mention that, you know, we're living through a pandemic and everybody is sort of this incredibly captive audience now, right? And so these are live events. They create urgency. And certainly, they drive traffic. But the internet is an on-demand medium.

And so we're excited to introduce a platform that conforms to the way that people traditionally experience their content, which is on-demand and asynchronously, and again, really focused on elevating that long tail. Because as exciting as it is to hear what Elon Musk has to say, again, you don't want to listen to the same kind of folks every day.

KRISTIN MYERS: So Doug, when you were talking about Twitter taking text and shortening it, and then you mentioned, of course, TikTok, which, of course, everyone thinks about Vine, which took video and decided to make content in just a couple of seconds or less, I'm wondering if you see that also coming in the podcast industry, where we might have an audio-only Quibi coming up soon.

DOUG IMBRUCE: Quibi, yeah, it's-- [LAUGHS] No, but it's-- look, I think that the great thing about audio is how deep and how thoughtful the content is. But because the average podcast is over 40 minutes in length, again, in kind of today's world where everyone's trained on not just consuming short form content, but also sharing it, these longer audio files, get left behind.

And that's why we've invested so much time in this layer of digital transformation, where we can actually evaluate the content of every podcast, surface the most engaging 60 seconds through machine learning, and then deliver those highlights in a feed that allows you to, as Melody mentioned, then go deeper.

And so we see Podz almost as a lead generation engine for time shifting the consumption of these longer form shows that are really thoughtful, really interesting, but that you just don't always have time to consume in the moment.

KRISTIN MYERS: I'm super new to podcasts. I literally only listen to two right now. So I'm definitely going to have to check out Podz to see what other podcasts are out there that I would be interested in. Doug Imbruce, Podz founder and CEO, and of course, Yahoo Finance's Melody Hahm, thank you both for joining us for this conversation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/podz-app-helps-consumers-discover-202755868.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'CNDT.US', 'SPOT.US']","['DOUG IMBRUCE', 'MELODY HAHM', 'PODCASTERS', 'PODCASTS']","{'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.089}"

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: One thing you didn't mention as a threat, and I know you're concerned about this as well, is climate change. How does that factor into your thinking?

SARA MENKER: Well it factors in a huge amount, right? So if you think of how we ended up with-- our platform currently ingests over 40,000 different data sources from around the world. Think of it as data that comes from public agencies, NGOs, companies that we partner with and license their data and we distribute their data. So it's a wide range, and then data we generate ourselves.

A huge amount of understanding agriculture means understanding your environment and ecology. , Like if you think of sort of the climate change conversation is natural tension between ecology and economy, right? There's this tension, like, economic growth has come at the cost of ecological decline. And agriculture kind of sits in the middle of the two, because agricultural demand is very much a function of economic growth and the economy. And agriculture supply is very much about ecology.

And because of that, our platform had tons of economic data and tons of climate data just naturally in it. And so we were able to sort of model and look at the role that climate change has in agricultural supply, and then extend that to many, many other industries, everything from infrastructure to mining to utilities, et cetera.

And one of the things that we saw in a year like last year, the US alone experienced wildfires in the West Coast, experienced floods in the early part of the season, then drought, then, like, unprecedented derecho winds in the same little microcosm of the Midwest, right? And so, you're having multiple types of disruptions happening much faster than they ever did before. And that's going to impact industry in sort of an unprecedented rate.

And it is, already, right? The number of billion-dollar-plus climate disasters that the US had last year was 22. It had $22 billion-plus climate-related disasters. This is everything from hurricanes to droughts to wildfires to storms and whatnot. Now if you think of the trajectory in-- if you look at the last 40 years, the last five years have had record numbers year after year. The second record after the 22 we had last year is 17.

172,2021-02-11T10:30:03+00:00,Amazon-Backed Rivian Plans Electric-Vehicle Plant in Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric-vehicle maker backed by Amazon.com Inc., is scouting locations in Europe to build a new factory, according to people familiar with the matter.

The site likely would first produce a delivery van for Amazon and soon after build Rivian models for consumers, the people said. While no site has been selected yet, several countries are under consideration, including the U.K., Germany and Hungary, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information. Other sites outside the European Union also are under consideration.

Rivian has hired the commercial real estate services firm JLL for the search. The carmaker hopes to start van production as soon as next year, some of the people said. It also has solicited pitches from real-estate advisers for retail space in Europe where it will exhibit its vehicles.

Representatives for Rivian, Amazon and JLL declined to comment.

Rivian is seen as a potential automotive disruptor akin to Tesla Inc., the world’s largest maker of purely battery-powered vehicles. The Irvine, California-based company is due to start production and U.S. deliveries of a pickup model in June, followed by an SUV in August. Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that it’s looking to go public as soon as September, potentially at a valuation of more than $50 billion.

Rivian has an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Amazon, which has invested in the company. Amazon has said it expects 10,000 of the vans to be on roads making deliveries globally by 2022, and the rest of the order is due by the end of the decade. Production of the vans is expected to start at Rivian’s plant in Normal, Illinois, by the fourth quarter.

Electric vehicles are a cornerstone of Amazon’s goal to deliver half its shipments without producing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It has bought tens of thousands of conventionally fueled vans in recent years and is increasingly delivering packages using bespoke contractors in Amazon-branded vehicles instead of relying on partners such as United Parcel Service Inc.

Three variants of the Rivian-built van are planned with different cab styles and sizes tailored to different types of cargo. The vans will be capable of driving around 150 miles (241 kilometers) between charges.

Rivian has raised more than $8 billion to date from high-profile companies and investors including Amazon, Ford Motor Co., T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. The carmaker was valued at $27.6 billion in its latest round, a person familiar with the matter said last month. It has more than 3,600 employees across sites in Michigan, California and the plant in Illinois, which was formerly owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.

173,2021-02-11T10:30:03+00:00,Amazon-Backed Rivian Plans Electric-Vehicle Plant in Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric-vehicle maker backed by Amazon.com Inc., is scouting locations in Europe to build a new factory, according to people familiar with the matter.

The site likely would first produce a delivery van for Amazon and soon after build Rivian models for consumers, the people said. While no site has been selected yet, several countries are under consideration, including the U.K., Germany and Hungary, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information. Other sites outside the European Union also are under consideration.

Rivian has hired the commercial real estate services firm JLL for the search. The carmaker hopes to start van production as soon as next year, some of the people said. It also has solicited pitches from real-estate advisers for retail space in Europe where it will exhibit its vehicles.

Representatives for Rivian, Amazon and JLL declined to comment.

Rivian is seen as a potential automotive disruptor akin to Tesla Inc., the world’s largest maker of purely battery-powered vehicles. The Irvine, California-based company is due to start production and U.S. deliveries of a pickup model in June, followed by an SUV in August. Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that it’s looking to go public as soon as September, potentially at a valuation of more than $50 billion.

Rivian has an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Amazon, which has invested in the company. Amazon has said it expects 10,000 of the vans to be on roads making deliveries globally by 2022, and the rest of the order is due by the end of the decade. Production of the vans is expected to start at Rivian’s plant in Normal, Illinois, by the fourth quarter.

Electric vehicles are a cornerstone of Amazon’s goal to deliver half its shipments without producing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It has bought tens of thousands of conventionally fueled vans in recent years and is increasingly delivering packages using bespoke contractors in Amazon-branded vehicles instead of relying on partners such as United Parcel Service Inc.

174,2021-02-11T09:02:59+00:00,15 Fastest-Growing Software Companies,"In this article we mention 15 fastest-growing software companies in the world. If you want to skip our discussion of the future of the software industry, analysts' predictions about software companies and job creation in the space, go directly to 5 fastest-growing software companies companies.

Software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. According to data by Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected to reach $4 trillion in 2021. Companies worldwide are embracing automation, Cloud computing, data analytics, websites, social media and AI to enhance their business and capture their customers online. This is driving the growth of software companies, especially SaaS. Data from U.S. Department of Labor shows that software is one of the fastest-growing industries when it comes to job creation. Jobs in computer and information technology as a whole are expected to grow 11% from 2019 through 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. Specifically in the software space, jobs are expected to grow by 22% through 2029, must faster than the average. To quote Marc Andreessen, software is eating the world.

Software companies create and build different programs that assist companies and individuals to solve key problems. Software companies are offering products and services in almost all walks of human life, including finance, entertainment, education, shopping, sports, military and healthcare. The coronavirus crisis fueled growth in the industry as companies scrambled to move their operations online: schools needed education software; retailers looked for ways to increase their online sales; banks started creating secure and user-friendly apps to allow customers perform their transactions by staying at home; and governments increased their IT spending to get rid of age-old ways of doing business.

IT jobs pay higher than most of the jobs in other industries. IT companies are also giving a boost to overall productivity. These factors are pushing GDP growth in the U.S. A report by the BSA Foundation shows that the software industry accounted for $1.6 trillion of the total $20.5 trillion U.S. GDP in 2018.

We had considered the company for the inception portfolio but decided to wait and watch it as we had concerns about how low oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainty back in March might affect their business. We have since been impressed with the company’s ability to navigate the tough macro environment, and oil prices have improved. We believe it has been able to deliver very attractive growth despite the macro uncertainty, giving us more confidence to start a position during the quarter. We think the company has an outstanding competitive position, a highly recurring business model, robust margins and returns, and a management team that exhibits all the behaviors that we seek, especially value-creating reinvestment.”

RV Capital in their Q4 2020 investor letter said that they saw a spectacular value in Slack Technologies, Inc. and acquired a position in the company. Here is what RV Capital stated:

""We became co-owners in Slack, a channels-based communication service for businesses. In an unexpected twist, a few months later it was acquired by Salesforce.com at roughly a 50% premium to what we had paid.

In accordance with my usual practice, I was planning on writing about our investment in Slack. By laying out my investment hypothesis at the onset of an investment, I hope to enable investors to assess in hindsight whether it worked (or not) because of a plausible investment philosophy consistently applied. Given that Slack has effectively already played out as an investment, this rationale has gone. After all, anyone can make a successful investment decision look smart after the fact.

There is one element of my Slack investment thesis that I would like to lay out as it neatly illustrates an idea in my first-half letter and has not yet played out. I wrote then that I wanted to invest more in “early-stage, listed companies”. What I meant by this are companies whose moat is not yet fully developed, but not so undeveloped that it is difficult to say if they will ever have one. I described early-stage companies as possessing:

The kernel of an idea (however unformed), which – if you squint – you can imagine creating a new paradigm in decades to come.

Slack was the type of company I had in mind when I wrote this. Its moat in its core business of providing channels-based communication within companies is well developed. It benefits from a network effect (the more employees on Slack, the higher the value they derive from it), a broad developer ecosystem (thousands of integrations have been built for Slack) and switching costs (Slack becomes tightly interwoven into a company’s workflow through said integrations).

What really got me excited – the new paradigm – is “Slack Connect”. Connect is a feature that allows companies to extend Slack beyond their own organisation to external partners. Connect has not yet achieved viral growth – the moat is not yet developed.”

7. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE: VEEV)

Revenue(2015): $313 million

Alger Small Cap Focus Fund in their Q3 2020 investor letter highlighted a few stocks and Veeva Systems Inc is one of them. Here is what Alger Small Cap Focus Fund stated:

""Veeva Systems is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for the global life sciences industry. Veeva’s key solutions are Commercial Cloud products, offering multi-channel customer relationship management software, and Veeva Vault, offering regulated content management for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Shares of Veeva performed strongly after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal second quarter 2021 results and raised its fiscal-year 2021 earnings and billings guidance. Veeva’s key growth driver continues to be strong adoption of Veeva Vault, with particular strength in the fiscal second quarter in its Quality Suite and Clinical Trial Management system. Veeva is making good progress on its recent acquisitions of Crossix, which provides a platform for optimizing health care marketing, and Physicians World. which provides a physicians’ speaker bureau. Since the earlier days of the pandemic in March, Veeva has offered its Veeva CRM Engage products to life sciences customers for free to enable virtual sales visits. Veeva intends to convert a large portion of these new customers into annual subscription contracts next year, as virtual selling has become more important during Covid-19. Finally, Veeva announced the formation of a board committee to explore the conversion of Veeva into a for-profit public-benefit corporation. Veeva would be the first public company to make this change. We believe this potential change would align well with Veeva’s existing culture and operations, that Veeva will still have the legal duty to maximize shareholder value and that the change could potentially create greater trust in Veeva to properly handle proprietary customer data.”

Slack Technologies is a software company that created Slack, a virtual collaboration tool. Founded in 2009, Slack was initially called Tiny Speck, and it was designed to develop the game, Glitch. When the game failed, Slack was unveiled to the public.

It has a business messaging platform that allows employees to share resources, ideas, files, and tasks virtually. Slack is an organizational tool that helps companies communicate as a group or privately to employees. The software syncs across various devices and provides real-time messaging and file sharing for business teams.

The goal of Slack is to improve efficiency in the workplace and reduce the need for physical meetings. Its headquarters are in California, USA, and it has offices in Ireland, Canada, and Australia

RV Capital in their Q4 2020 investor letter said that they saw a spectacular value in Slack Technologies, Inc. and acquired a position in the company. Here is what RV Capital stated:

""We became co-owners in Slack, a channels-based communication service for businesses. In an unexpected twist, a few months later it was acquired by Salesforce.com at roughly a 50% premium to what we had paid.

In accordance with my usual practice, I was planning on writing about our investment in Slack. By laying out my investment hypothesis at the onset of an investment, I hope to enable investors to assess in hindsight whether it worked (or not) because of a plausible investment philosophy consistently applied. Given that Slack has effectively already played out as an investment, this rationale has gone. After all, anyone can make a successful investment decision look smart after the fact.

There is one element of my Slack investment thesis that I would like to lay out as it neatly illustrates an idea in my first-half letter and has not yet played out. I wrote then that I wanted to invest more in “early-stage, listed companies”. What I meant by this are companies whose moat is not yet fully developed, but not so undeveloped that it is difficult to say if they will ever have one. I described early-stage companies as possessing:

The kernel of an idea (however unformed), which – if you squint – you can imagine creating a new paradigm in decades to come.

Slack was the type of company I had in mind when I wrote this. Its moat in its core business of providing channels-based communication within companies is well developed. It benefits from a network effect (the more employees on Slack, the higher the value they derive from it), a broad developer ecosystem (thousands of integrations have been built for Slack) and switching costs (Slack becomes tightly interwoven into a company’s workflow through said integrations).

What really got me excited – the new paradigm – is “Slack Connect”. Connect is a feature that allows companies to extend Slack beyond their own organisation to external partners. Connect has not yet achieved viral growth – the moat is not yet developed.”

Alger Small Cap Focus Fund in their Q3 2020 investor letter highlighted a few stocks and Veeva Systems Inc is one of them. Here is what Alger Small Cap Focus Fund stated:

""Veeva Systems is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for the global life sciences industry. Veeva’s key solutions are Commercial Cloud products, offering multi-channel customer relationship management software, and Veeva Vault, offering regulated content management for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Shares of Veeva performed strongly after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal second quarter 2021 results and raised its fiscal-year 2021 earnings and billings guidance. Veeva’s key growth driver continues to be strong adoption of Veeva Vault, with particular strength in the fiscal second quarter in its Quality Suite and Clinical Trial Management system. Veeva is making good progress on its recent acquisitions of Crossix, which provides a platform for optimizing health care marketing, and Physicians World. which provides a physicians’ speaker bureau. Since the earlier days of the pandemic in March, Veeva has offered its Veeva CRM Engage products to life sciences customers for free to enable virtual sales visits. Veeva intends to convert a large portion of these new customers into annual subscription contracts next year, as virtual selling has become more important during Covid-19. Finally, Veeva announced the formation of a board committee to explore the conversion of Veeva into a for-profit public-benefit corporation. Veeva would be the first public company to make this change. We believe this potential change would align well with Veeva’s existing culture and operations, that Veeva will still have the legal duty to maximize shareholder value and that the change could potentially create greater trust in Veeva to properly handle proprietary customer data.”

* Amazon says previous court order on asset sale is illegal

* U.S. firm alleges Future is in breach of contract

* Future has said it could face liquidation if deal fails(Adds detail from Amazon court filing)

By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy

NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc tookits legal challenge against partner Future Group's $3.4 billionretail assets sale to India's Supreme Court on Thursday, as theU.S. firm tries to stop a major rival buying the assets.

Amazon alleges that Future Group violated contracts byagreeing to sell the retail assets to market leader RelianceIndustries last year. Future denies any wrongdoing.

A New Delhi court this week dealt a blow to the U.S. firm byrevoking a previous court decision that effectively blocked thedeal, and Amazon has now filed an appeal against it in theSupreme Court in the capital city.

Amazon said in its court filing the order by the Delhi courtwas ""illegal"" and ""arbitrary"" and the company would face""irreparable harm"" if the top court did not intervene.

""The greater the progress made towards the completion"" ofthe deal, ""the harder it will be to unravel it,"" Amazon said inthe filing seen by Reuters.

Amazon and Future did not respond to requests for comment.

The legal fight over Future's assets has embroiled two ofthe world's richest men - Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance'sMukesh Ambani. The final outcome is seen shaping India'spandemic-hit shopping sector and will determine if Amazon isable to dent the dominance of Reliance.

Amazon will argue in its Supreme Court appeal that anarbitration order in October that put the Future-Reliance dealon hold remains valid, one of the sources familiar with thematter told Reuters.

The dispute arose when Future Group agreed in August to sellits retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance.

Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unitincluded clauses saying the Indian group couldn't sell itsretail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list,including Reliance.

Future, India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700stores, has said it will be pushed towards liquidation if thedeal falls through.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by ChristianSchmollinger and Elaine Hardcastle)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-amazon-appeals-indias-supreme-032948356.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'RELIANCE.NSE', 'RLI.F']","['AMAZON', 'COURT FILING', 'COURT ORDER', 'FUTURE GROUP']","{'polarity': 0.842, 'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.14}"
177,2021-02-10T17:52:46+00:00,How a sneaky rise in oil prices could affect toy prices,"Hasbro Chairman and CEO Brian Goldner is closely watching the recent under-the-radar rise in oil prices and what it could mean to the cost of making toys. But at this point, Goldner isn’t baking in major price increases on Hasbro’s toys this year because of the advance in the commodity.

“We’re not really looking at substantial price increases on our products,” Goldner told Yahoo Finance Live. “We signed contracts with a lot of our third-party manufacturers for more than 12 to 18 months. So we might see oil prices creep up and then over a period of time behind that, resin prices might go [up]. But we haven’t seen major spikes yet.”

Oil is a key component in the resin used to make toys. And its climb higher this year (without much fanfare) amid hope for a strong global economic recovery after the pandemic has raised some concerns in the toy industry on the financial impact.

Brent crude oil prices have gained nearly 20% in 2021 as of Wednesday afternoon trading. At $60 a barrel, oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year.

“Yes, it very well could have an impact but it typically wouldn't start showing up in the supply chain for many months,” explained The Toy Insider senior editor James Zahn.

Added Zahn, “When oil prices dropped a year or so ago there was a long term hope that they'd stay low enough to create some cost savings. The needle didn't move much either way. Retailers are placing holiday orders right now so MSRPs for those products are locked.”

So that’s the good news.

(Charles Sykes/AP Images for Hasbro)

But what’s not a welcomed development — and which could ultimately trigger price increases on toys this year — are rising transportation costs as ports on the East and West Coasts have clogged because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s an issue — fueled by labor shortages and a crush of e-commerce demand — that companies from Hasbro to Peloton are dealing with at the moment, much to the detriment of margins.

“The bigger concern in terms of pricing right now is the cost of containers and shipping in general. There are still some jam ups that are rippling across the chain. I just got a note from a collectibles company that they upped a $39.95 figurine to $49.95 for that very reason,” Zahn said.

Story continues

Hasbro’s Goldner acknowledges the transportation cost pressures, too.

“We are seeing a bit of pressure in domestic shipments — that’s something we think we can mitigate over time,” Goldner said.

178,2021-02-10T14:17:02+00:00,"Skyworks, Harley-Davidson, Apple, Amazon and Google highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – February 10, 2021 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. SWKS as the Bull of the Day, Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

The 4th Industrial Revolution is upon us, and connectivity is becoming a central focus as 5G technology rolls out. Skyworks and its growing portfolio of digitally connected chips are essential components to the 'smart' world we live in.

Today almost everything we interact with is digitally linked to the internet, also known as the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem. 4G networks weren't built to handle the volume of data or required speed of this rapidly expanding ecosystem of connected devices. The 5G revolution is an essential transition to allow our increasingly 'smart' world to function in real-time.

Skyworks' cutting-edge chip technology is critical for the ushering out of 5G devices, and this past quarterly report really illustrated the vitality of this enterprise. The company's vision of Connecting Everyone and Everything, All the Time is coming to fruition, and analysts are getting excited. Analysts have been significantly raising their EPS estimates across every time horizon, propelling SWKS to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Recent Earnings Report

Skyworks had an exceptionally strong earnings report to round out what will go down as one of the craziest years in history. The business illustrated a blowout quarter, with an enormous top & bottom-line beat in addition to increased forward guidance that had analysts racing to boost their price targets.

The innovation-driven enterprise reported record revenues of over $1.5 billion in its December quarter, up 69% from the prior year. Skyworks has never had a more profitable quarter with $516 million on the bottom-line, illustrating nearly 100% expansion compared to last year's December quarter results.

Story continues

The new 5G iPhone release, along with other leading 5G devices, have been a sizable tailwind for the business. Skyworks' Sky5 chip portfolio is accelerating with next-generation 5G, ""supporting the next wave of 5G launches at Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other Tier-1 players"" (aka Apple, its #1 customer), according to the quarterly release.

In its earnings call, President & CEO Liam Griffin said that the company was dedicated to investing more in its own fabs (aka internal manufacturing) to keep up with the swelling chip demand. The company ended the year with $1 billion in cash & equivalents, no debt, and an over $1 billion run rate in post-dividend free-cash-flows giving the enterprise enormous financial flexibility for internal investment (which the business has continuously done), and synergy driving acquisitions.

What's Next For SWKS

SWKS shares surged to fresh highs following this unbelievable quarter, with the stock trading in a range between roughly $170 - $190 since this report was released. The markets are still digesting the earnings news, but it would appear that this stock still has some legs to rally.

Skyworks is spending the money to continue growing its footprint in fabrication, so the business doesn't have to rely too heavily on external manufacturing. The company has been investing heavily in internal development of 5G chips for the IoT explosion that has already begun and SWKS is just beginning to see the benefits.

SWKS is expected to see a 68% EPS improvement in its fiscal 2021 (ending September 30th), on top of a 47% increase in revenues.

SWKS remains at a relative discount despite its nearly 20% price surge since its earnings report at the end of January. The stock is trading at a price to 12-month forward earnings of 17.4x compared to the tech sector's 29x.

I am very bullish on SWKS positioning in the marketplace, with a nearly 25% market share in RF chips for smartphones. The company is well-positioned for the commencing IoT & 5G revolution. 14 out of 22 analysts are calling this stock a buy today with no sell ratings. Its most optimistic price target represents a 36% upside, which I believe is very attainable after that stellar earnings report at the end of January.

Bear of the Day:

Harley-Davidson is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a popular motorcycle manufacturer. The company operates in two segments, Motorcycles and Related Products and Financial Services. The motorcycle segment represents 80% of their revenues and is the primary driver of earnings growth.

Unfortunately for investors, there wasn't much growth this past quarter. The company disappointed on EPS and the stock was crushed. As we approach the summer driving season, investors are left with hope that the motorcycle consumer will come back strong with their stimulus checks. However, there might be more of a fundamental issue at hand.

More about HOG

Harley-Davidson is an iconic American brand that was founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The company is valued around $5 billion and has a PE of 14. HOG has Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" in Value but ""D"" in Growth. Harley pays a small dividend of 0.24%.

There is no questioning Harley's influence in Americana over the years, but that doesn't help its stock price today. Earnings last week forced the stock over 20% lower the day they reported.

Q4 Earnings

Before this quarter, Harley has missed on EPS only twice since 2019. The surprise miss last week wasn't necessarily surprising, but the magnitude was, with a 730% EPS miss. The company lost 44 cents instead of the expected +.10 and revenues came in below expectations as well. Both U.S. and international sales were down year after year and the operating margin hurt, coming in at -37% vs the -5.3% last year.

While the numbers may seem like a disaster, the company unveiled ""The Hardwire"" a five-year strategic plan that will target profitable growth and brand desirability. In this plan the company will target low double-digit EPS growth through 2025 by broadening the view of its customer, investing in core segments and strengthening its commitment to electric motorcycles.

Management obviously has identified the issues and had comments going forward:

""The entire Harley-Davidson team put forth tremendous effort in 2020 and we now have the right organization, structure and strategy in place to make step changes in our performance and enhance our position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world.""

While there is a plan, analysts and investors might not be on board yet. The company will have to prove itself in upcoming quarters as for now, estimates are falling.

Estimates

The quarter forced estimates lower over all time frames. The last 7 days have seen next quarters estimates fall from $1.20 to $0.90, or 20%. For the current year, estimates dropped from $2.76 to $2.34, or 15%.

The drop in estimates led to price cuts from Wedbush ($42 from $45) and BMO ($40 from $46).

A Fundamental Issue

The motorcycle industry has gone through hard years as late, with sluggish sales being blamed on more risk-averse millennials. There simply aren't enough new riders to replace the older riders that supported the industry for so long. Motorcycles simply aren't as cool as they used to be. For those with the disposable income that might have taken up the idea thirty years ago, they are not riding or buying into the brand.

But perhaps the end of COVID might change everything. The idea of getting out on the road after being stuck in your house for a year might sound great for some new customers. Harley and other motorcycle companies need to market and sell that idea if they want to change the trend away from bikes.

The Technicals

The chart looked great before earnings, but the down move broke some key levels. The $30 area is the 200-day Moving average and investors that think the company can turn things around should eyeball that level. Back over $40 would indicate the bulls know something the bears don't, so let's assume if the stock can get back there, The Hardwire plan is working

In Summary

It's going to take a while for the company to prove itself, so for now investors should consider this stock dead money. It is hard not to root for a brand like Harley, as the iconic American image has so much value in itself. Everyone loves a turnaround story, but be patient with this one.

179,2021-02-10T11:00:19+00:00,Microsoft CEO's Take on Tech's Clout: `Big by Itself Is Not Bad’,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said social-media services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube need clearer laws and rules to govern whether controversial accounts, like former U.S. President Donald Trump’s, have a place on their services, rather than being asked to make free-speech decisions themselves.

“Unilateral action by individual companies in democracies like ours is just not long-term stable—we do need to be able to have a framework of laws and norms,” Nadella said in a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “Depending on any one individual CEO in any one of these companies to make calls that are going to really help us maintain something as sacred and as important as our democracy in the long run is just no way that at least I, as a citizen, would advocate for.”

Microsoft doesn’t currently run a consumer social media service, but it is among cloud-computing providers that have been pulled into the debate over the deplatforming of certain individual voices, social-media accounts and entire apps, especially following the violent pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its hosting services from Parler LLC, a social network that touts itself as anti-censorship and was popular among conservative and extremist figures. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google previously had removed Parler from their app stores. The three tech companies’ actions essentially took the service offline. Trump’s account, meantime, was banned from Twitter Inc. and remains suspended on Facebook Inc.

In the past several years, antitrust regulators have ramped up investigations into the market power of large technology companies, just as Microsoft fell under government scrutiny and faced a U.S. antitrust lawsuit more than two decades ago, when Nadella was a rising manager. It’s better for the younger technology companies to face robust competition and handle negative consequences of growing too big ahead of time, rather than waiting until their size leads to problems for consumers and rivals, the CEO said.

Story continues

“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”

The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said.

“There is no God-given right for U.S. tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said. “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.

Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”

180,2021-02-10T11:00:19+00:00,Microsoft CEO's Take on Tech's Clout: `Big by Itself Is Not Bad’,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said social-media services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube need clearer laws and rules to govern whether controversial accounts, like former U.S. President Donald Trump’s, have a place on their services, rather than being asked to make free-speech decisions themselves.

“Unilateral action by individual companies in democracies like ours is just not long-term stable—we do need to be able to have a framework of laws and norms,” Nadella said in a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “Depending on any one individual CEO in any one of these companies to make calls that are going to really help us maintain something as sacred and as important as our democracy in the long run is just no way that at least I, as a citizen, would advocate for.”

Microsoft doesn’t currently run a consumer social media service, but it is among cloud-computing providers that have been pulled into the debate over the deplatforming of certain individual voices, social-media accounts and entire apps, especially following the violent pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its hosting services from Parler LLC, a social network that touts itself as anti-censorship and was popular among conservative and extremist figures. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google previously had removed Parler from their app stores. The three tech companies’ actions essentially took the service offline. Trump’s account, meantime, was banned from Twitter Inc. and remains suspended on Facebook Inc.

In the past several years, antitrust regulators have ramped up investigations into the market power of large technology companies, just as Microsoft fell under government scrutiny and faced a U.S. antitrust lawsuit more than two decades ago, when Nadella was a rising manager. It’s better for the younger technology companies to face robust competition and handle negative consequences of growing too big ahead of time, rather than waiting until their size leads to problems for consumers and rivals, the CEO said.

“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”

The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said.

“There is no God-given right for U.S. tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said. “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.

Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”

181,2021-02-10T02:11:15+00:00,Amazon-Backed EV-Maker Rivian Aims for IPO This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric-vehicle startup backed by Amazon.com Inc. and Ford Motor Co., is looking to go public as soon as September at a valuation of about $50 billion and perhaps more, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company’s timeline for an initial public offering and its potential value might change, and a listing could happen later in the year or even slip to 2022, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Rivian has been speaking to bankers about its plans, one of the people said.

Rivian, one of the highest-profile potential competitors to Tesla Inc., has raised more than $8 billion to date from investors who expect its battery-electric pickup and SUV to perform well in the U.S. market. At a $50 billion valuation, it would likely be one of the biggest IPOs of the year and one of the most noteworthy EV listings since Tesla’s 2010 offering.

The startup was valued at $27.6 billion in a funding round in January, Bloomberg News reported. Rivian raised $2.65 billion in the round from a group of investors led by T. Rowe Price Group Inc. Also in January, Claire McDonough, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive, became Rivian’s chief financial officer.

A representative for Rivian declined to comment.

Several electric vehicle makers and related companies have gone public in the past year through IPOs or through deals with so-called blank-check companies. Chinese EV startup Li Auto Inc. raised $1.26 billion in a U.S. IPO in July. Another Chinese electric-car company, XPeng Inc., raised $1.5 billion in August in a U.S. listing.

Fuel cell-truck startup Hyzon Motors Inc. agreed this month to a merger with Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp., in a deal that values the two combined at more than $2 billion. Last year, Nikola Corp. also went public in a deal with a blank-check company, also known as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.

Story continues

Rivian has more than 3,600 employees split across offices in Michigan and California and its production facility in Illinois.

Rivian also has a deal with Amazon to build 100,000 custom electric delivery vans by 2030. In the near-term, the companies say 10,000 of the vans will be on the road making deliveries by 2022. Rivian will build three different models of the van, which is capable of going about 150 miles on a single charge.

Production and U.S. deliveries of its debut consumer EV, the R1T pickup, are due to start in June. The company will then start delivering its R1S SUV in August. The company has retrofitted a former Mitsubishi Motors plant in Normal, Illinois, where it also plans to build the EV delivery van for Amazon.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

ZACK GUZMAN: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. A couple milestones to note here in what has been a very strong start to February for the overall indices. We can see here, the Dow and the NASDAQ in the green, the S&P 500 the lone index just slightly below break even today. But all three, including the Russell 2000, hit record highs today in the session. We'll continue to track that and bring you updates as we see them play out.

But right now I want to shift our focus to one of the stories we saw play out last year that spilled over into 2021. That would be the strength of e-commerce and the battle going on in that space as others chase to catch up and catch Amazon. Here to discuss that with us is Larry Cheng, Managing Partner at Volition Capital.

And Larry, I mean, Amazon's been focused on this space, but what's interesting to me is kind of the shift of their attention over to the cloud side of the business, including that changeover in the CEO role, as Jeff Bezos moves on. But how important is their lead in the retail space going to be as they still take on, you know, pretty big giants in Walmart and others?

LARRY CHENG: Well, Amazon is the dominant e-commerce player today and they will stay that way for the next 10 years. But we do think they will be on a secular decline in market share because the big box retailers are investing in e-commerce quite effectively. The Shopify ecosystem is expanding aggressively, and there's tremendous amount of venture dollars that are pouring into various specialty e-commerce players like we did with Chewy in the pet food vertical or Wayfair in the furniture vertical and other upstart players are competing well against Amazon in some of those specialty areas.

- Yeah, Larry, I think is interesting you highlight that and in your note you say Amazon can be beaten. Which sounds like you've got a lot of conviction behind that call. That's a pretty bold one. And in the past when you look at some of these specialized players, the idea has been to partner with an Amazon. Some have been acquired by Amazon. You think we're starting to see a bit of push-back on something like that?

Story continues

LARRY CHENG: Yeah. So I do think Amazon can be beaten, but let me say more specifically, in specific specialty verticals. If a business is completely focused on winning a customer in a particular area, whether it's grocery, pet, furniture, pharmacy, alcohol delivery. These are areas where if an entire business is focused on it, they can provide a premium service, a better community, stronger merchandising, better content for that customer in those categories. And there have been billions of dollars created by companies like Chewy, Wayfair, and Carvana, who have specialized and won. So yes, we do think Amazon can be beaten in these areas.

Will Amazon be beaten in e-commerce as a whole? Probably not. I mean, Amazon is doing tremendously well. There's great secular growth drivers for them, but in specialty verticals they can.

ZACK GUZMAN: And then just kind of to tie it back to the cloud space too I mean, how does it maybe matter in terms of the trade-off there, and not to say that they can't focus on both things at the same time because let's be honest, it's Amazon. But I mean, obviously, these other retailers in catching up might putting their own attention so heavily into the retail race, when you look at a Walmart or some of the other names you mentioned there.

LARRY CHENG: The great advantage of Amazon in retail is that they don't have to make money on retail. So they have AWS, they are the internet infrastructure provider for the internet. They are an outsource third party fulfillment capability for a number of e-commerce brands, they have a massive online ad network through their third party online retail business.

All of this generates cash, which enables them to keep their core first party e-commerce business at a low margin, a low price point. They can make massive strategic investments over a decade long period. And there's no other retailer in the world that doesn't have to make money on retail. And that is the advantage that Amazon has and that's why I think they will continue to make those investments in the cloud and they will continue to compete in those ways.

- Yeah, one of the reasons why we talk so much about Amazon is because it does feel like they really own the full stack. It's not just about the platform itself. It's about the logistics play. It's about the cloud play. When you look at all of the growth outside of Amazon though, what kind of opportunities does that open up for somebody like you as an investor? I mean, what are some of these areas, whether it's a Shopify or some other players out there who are supporting in the cloud space, who are helping with the infrastructure that you think you see real opportunities for growth?

LARRY CHENG: Well, as a big experiment, our entire team has decided not to shop on Amazon for the last month. So we're in the last week of that experiment and what I learned from that is the Shopify ecosystem is competitive, the retailers have built on that platform.

When it comes to an end user experience, you're getting a competitive experienced on one click shopping, you're getting a competitive experience on fulfillment notification. Where you're not getting a full competitive experience within the Shopify retailers is their fulfillment capability is not up to speed with Amazon yet. That will need to evolve over time.

But that ecosystem is growing. I think there's a number of retailers that are platforming on Shopify rather than on Amazon, and so I think you can see growth there. The big box retailers like Target's now a $10 billion e-commerce business, Home Depot is a $10 billion e-commerce business, Nordstrom's and Best Buy, half of their business is on e-com. And so you see-- you're seeing acquisitions and investments being made by traditional players, that is also growing their share in the e-com space as well.

ZACK GUZMAN: All right, Larry Cheng, Managing Partner at Volition Capital. Good luck with the last days of that experiment.

185,2021-02-09T22:20:07+00:00,"5 'Celebrity SPACs' To Consider: Shaq, Serena, Steph, A-Rod And Ciara","The SPAC market continues to grow with a record number of special purpose acquisition companies being offered and a record amount of money raised in January.

That record number reflects more companies and investors with no SPAC experience continuing to enter the market, including some athletes and celebrities. Jim Cramer issued a caution to investors to avoid “celebrity SPAC plays.”

Cramer said these SPACs, “Feel like an inside joke for the super-rich.”

Many athletes and celebrities have investments outside of their everyday line of work and some of these ventures have proven successful. While not every celebrity SPAC is guaranteed to succeed, here is a look at some for investors to consider.

Forest Road Acquisition: NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal is a member of the Forest Road Acquisition Corp (NYSE: FRX) SPAC team.

O’Neal isn’t just an NBA legend, he also has done well with some of his investments. He was an early investor in Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Ring, a company acquired by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN).

O’Neal sits on the board of directors of Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ: PZZA), owns an equity stake in the company and franchise restaurants. O'Neal also owns Auntie Anne's franchise restaurants, part of Focus Brands.

The thing that stands out on this celebrity SPAC is the involvement of three former Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) executives. Thomas Staggs was the CFO of Disney from 1998 to 2010, handling financials during a time when the company acquired Capital Cities/ABC, Pixar and Marvel Entertainment. Staggs also served as the chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, pushing the company to open a theme park in Shanghai.

Kevin Mayer served as the executive vice president of the internet group including ESPN.com while working at Disney. Mayer was also part of the Disney’s direct to consumer strategy and the launch of Disney+.

Salil Mehta worked at Disney from 1994 to 2008 serving under the ESPN Enterprises division.

Dune Acquisition: Another SPAC with an NBA star is Dune Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: DUNEU), which is still trading as units. Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry is a member of the SPAC team searching for a technology or SaaS company.

Curry is a leading endorser for Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA) and has invested in companies like Slyce, Oxygen, Mos and Guild Education. So-called SPAC king Chamath Palihapitiya is a part owner in the Warriors and could be linked to future deals Curry does.

Bright Lights: Grammy award-winning musician Ciara is part of the SPAC team for Bright Lights Acquisition (NASDAQ: BLTSU). The SPAC is targeting the consumer products, media, entertainment and sports sectors.

Other members of the management team have worked with companies like Dick Clark Productions, MGM, TV Guide Network, Six Flags, News Corporation and Disney.

Jaws Spitfire Acquisition: Tennis legend Serena Williams is a member of the SPAC team for Jaws Spitfire Acquisition Corp (NYSE: SPFR). Starwood Capital CEO Barry Sternlicht is leading the SPAC and has already announced a deal for Cano Health with a prior SPAC of Jaws Acquisition Corp (NYSE: JWS). Williams has invested in over 30 companies with her Serena Ventures including Tonal, Olly and Masterclass.

Slam Corp: Former MLB star Alex Rodriguez is part of the Slam Corporation (NASDAQ:SLAMU) SPAC seeking to raise $500 million. The SPAC will target the sports, media, entertainment, health and wellness and consumer technology sectors. The SPAC is not seeking to acquire a professional sports franchise.

The team includes QuantumScape Corp (NYSE: QS) CEO and Co-Founder Jagdeep Singh, who was part of one of the top performing SPAC deals of the last year when his company went public.

186,2021-02-09T17:00:39+00:00,Aurora Partners With Toyota in Bid to Bring Autonomy to Masses,"(Bloomberg) -- Aurora Innovation Inc., a Silicon Valley-based autonomous-driving startup with at least a $10 billion valuation, has agreed to a long-term strategic partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. and its supplier Denso Corp. that aims to mass produce autonomous vehicles and launch them on ride-hailing networks, including Uber’s, over the next few years.

The first model that will be equipped with the Aurora Driver, the company’s hardware, software and sensor suite, is the Toyota Sienna minivan, with testing of an initial fleet to begin this year. Toyota, which overtook Volkswagen AG as the world’s top-selling automaker in 2020, is also an investor in Uber Technologies Inc. and has a formidable brand that has long been associated with high volume manufacturing and safety. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Toyota will gain an observer seat on Aurora’s board.

“This is a really exciting set of developments,” said Sterling Anderson, Aurora’s Chief Product Officer, in an interview. The company is a key player in the intensely competitive self-driving vehicle industry. “We’re partnering with the largest automaker and the largest ride hailing network. It’s not just the development of the vehicle, but development of the service.”

Aurora is one of several leading startups racing to commercialize its self-driving technology, along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, which was later renamed Waymo, Amazon.com Inc.-owned Zoox Inc. and General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC. Toyota, which has long preferred to develop new technology in-house, has been coy about its autonomous ambitions. The Japanese carmaker struck a similar agreement with Chinese driverless startup Pony.ai Inc. in 2019, which it firmed up last year with a $400 million investment.

187,2021-02-09T17:00:39+00:00,Aurora Partners With Toyota in Bid to Bring Autonomy to Masses,"(Bloomberg) -- Aurora Innovation Inc., a Silicon Valley-based autonomous-driving startup with at least a $10 billion valuation, has agreed to a long-term strategic partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. and its supplier Denso Corp. that aims to mass produce autonomous vehicles and launch them on ride-hailing networks, including Uber’s, over the next few years.

The first model that will be equipped with the Aurora Driver, the company’s hardware, software and sensor suite, is the Toyota Sienna minivan, with testing of an initial fleet to begin this year. Toyota, which overtook Volkswagen AG as the world’s top-selling automaker in 2020, is also an investor in Uber Technologies Inc. and has a formidable brand that has long been associated with high volume manufacturing and safety. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Toyota will gain an observer seat on Aurora’s board.

“This is a really exciting set of developments,” said Sterling Anderson, Aurora’s Chief Product Officer, in an interview. The company is a key player in the intensely competitive self-driving vehicle industry. “We’re partnering with the largest automaker and the largest ride hailing network. It’s not just the development of the vehicle, but development of the service.”

Aurora is one of several leading startups racing to commercialize its self-driving technology, along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, which was later renamed Waymo, Amazon.com Inc.-owned Zoox Inc. and General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC. Toyota, which has long preferred to develop new technology in-house, has been coy about its autonomous ambitions. The Japanese carmaker struck a similar agreement with Chinese driverless startup Pony.ai Inc. in 2019, which it firmed up last year with a $400 million investment.

“Toyota is dedicated to creating and realizing mobility for all by focusing on technology that will move people safely and responsibly, a vision Aurora shares with us,” Keiji Yamamoto, operating officer of Toyota and President of Connected Company, said in a statement.

188,2021-02-09T15:53:03+00:00,"FedEx, Harley-Davidson, Microsoft, Micron and Amazon highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – February 9, 2021 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of FedEx Corporation FDX as the Bull of the Day, Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

FedEx is a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) that is a leader in global express delivery services. The company proves a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services that delivers to more than 220 countries and territories.

The stock really got going late last year, more than tripling from its March lows to the end of 2021. The recent pullback provides investors with a technical entry point after the stock saw support at a Fibonacci retracement level. Additionally, after UPS earnings last week, the fundamentals in the industry look strong, making an argument for FDX to grind higher into earnings on March 18th.

About the Company

FedEx was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The company employs 245,000 employees, has 30,000 service vehicles and has 98,000 drop off locations.

FDX has a market cap of about $67 Billion and has Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Growth and “B” in Value. The Forward PE is just 15, which makes the case for valuation in relative terms.

The company is currently reporting, primarily through the FedEx Express (including TNT Express acquired in 2016), FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments. These segments contributed 51.3%, 32.8% and 10.3% respectively to the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2020.

FedEx also pays a dividend of 1.02%.

Q2 Earnings

FDX reported in late December, seeing an EPS surprise beat to the upside of 23%. The company also beat on revenue and affirmed FY21 capex. It was the third straight EPS beat for FedEx after a string of messy quarters in the previous years.

Story continues

The company said that operating results increased due to volume growth in the FedEx International Priority and U.S. domestic residential package services as well as pricing initiatives across all transportation segments. Those positive factors were offset by increased costs due to expanded services and COVID-19 related costs, but Non-GAAP op margins came in at 7.4% vs the 3.9% last year.

The company expects earnings growth in the second half of the year, but investors took the opportunity to sell into the good news after the monster stock run.

Estimates

Over the last 60 days, estimates have shot higher. For the current quarter, we have seen estimates raised by 17%, from $2.74 to $3.25. For the current year, we have seen a 12% move higher in that same time frame.

The trend higher is bullish and that idea has been reinforced by recent earnings from the company’s biggest competitor.

UPS Earnings

Last week, UPS reported an EPS beat on the top line and a 26% surprise to the upside. The company saw double digit year over year growth in domestic and international revenues. For the upcoming year, the company expects higher margins and a hike to its dividend.

The numbers signal that FedEx will enjoy similar success when it announces earnings in March. With the recent move higher in FDX this past week, it looks like investors are already jumping in.

The Technicals

The stock moved below $100 in March, but rose throughout the rest of the year, making a high of $305.66 in December. Since then, the company reported earnings and profit takers have come in, taking the stock below $240.

That area marked the halfway back, or 50% Fibonacci retracement level form the August breakout point to the $305 highs. The stock has now bounced and is above the 21-day moving average at $249. If it can take back the 50-day, currently at $266, the bulls will have fresh powder higher into the EPS report in March.

Bottom Line

The run last year happened only after the realization that the company would thrive during the pandemic. The recent sell off was due to profit taking and the question of if the success can continue. The UPS earnings gives us a clear signal that FDX will continue to thrive in the current environment.

Expect the stock to grind higher into earnings, much like it did during the August and September months. If the company can prove itself once again, all-time highs should come before the end of the quarter.

Bear of the Day:

Harley-Davidson is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a popular motorcycle manufacturer. The company operates in two segments, Motorcycles and Related Products and Financial Services. The motorcycle segment represents 80% of their revenues and is the primary driver of earnings growth.

Unfortunately for investors, there wasn’t much growth this past quarter. The company disappointed on EPS and the stock was crushed. As we approach the summer driving season, investors are left with hope that the motorcycle consumer will come back strong with their stimulus checks. However, there might be more of a fundamental issue at hand.

More about HOG

Harley-Davidson is an iconic American brand that was founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The company is valued around $5 billion and has a PE of 14. HOG has Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value but “D” in Growth. Harley pays a small dividend of 0.24%.

There is no questioning Harley's influence in Americana over the years, but that doesn’t help its stock price today. Earnings last week forced the stock over 20% lower the day they reported.

Q4 Earnings

Before this quarter, Harley has missed on EPS only twice since 2019. The surprise miss last week wasn’t necessarily surprising, but the magnitude was, with a 730% EPS miss. The company lost 44 cents instead of the expected +.10 and revenues came in below expectations as well. Both U.S. and international sales were down year after year and the operating margin hurt, coming in at -37% vs the -5.3% last year.

While the numbers may seem like a disaster, the company unveiled “The Hardwire” a five-year strategic plan that will target profitable growth and brand desirability. In this plan the company will target low double-digit EPS growth through 2025 by broadening the view of its customer, investing in core segments and strengthening its commitment to electric motorcycles.

Management obviously has identified the issues and had comments going forward:

“The entire Harley-Davidson team put forth tremendous effort in 2020 and we now have the right organization, structure and strategy in place to make step changes in our performance and enhance our position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world.”

While there is a plan, analysts and investors might not be on board yet. The company will have to prove itself in upcoming quarters as for now, estimates are falling.

Estimates

The quarter forced estimates lower over all time frames. The last 7 days have seen next quarters estimates fall from $1.20 to $0.90, or 20%. For the current year, estimates dropped from $2.76 to $2.34, or 15%.

The drop in estimates led to price cuts from Wedbush ($42 from $45) and BMO ($40 from $46).

A Fundamental Issue

The motorcycle industry has gone through hard years as late, with sluggish sales being blamed on more risk-averse millennials. There simply aren’t enough new riders to replace the older riders that supported the industry for so long. Motorcycles simply aren’t as cool as they used to be. For those with the disposable income that might have taken up the idea thirty years ago, they are not riding or buying into the brand.

But perhaps the end of COVID might change everything. The idea of getting out on the road after being stuck in your house for a year might sound great for some new customers. Harley and other motorcycle companies need to market and sell that idea if they want to change the trend away from bikes.

The Technicals

The chart looked great before earnings, but the down move broke some key levels. The $30 area is the 200-day Moving average and investors that think the company can turn things around should eyeball that level. Back over $40 would indicate the bulls know something the bears don’t, so let’s assume if the stock can get back there, The Hardwire plan is working

In Summary

It's going to take a while for the company to prove itself, so for now investors should consider this stock dead money. It is hard not to root for a brand like Harley, as the iconic American image has so much value in itself. Everyone loves a turnaround story, but be patient with this one and let the chart speak for itself.

Stocks to Watch as Adoption of A.I. Looks Poised to Grow

Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) has become an integral part of the technology revolution that we have been witnessing over the years on an accelerated shift toward automation to increase efficiency or handle complex data sets and calculations. The COVID-19 pandemic last year gave a push to digital transformation as the world shifted to a remote working model to curb the spread of the virus, in turn, boosting the need for AI. Notably, per a report by SG Analytics, the global market size of AI is estimated to witness a CAGR of 42.2% between 2020 and 2027.

The report mentioned that certain trends will be important to look forward to in 2021. This includes trends like robotic process automation, which allows monotonous tasks to be carried out efficiently in large volumes by AI.

Other trends like natural language processing, which teaches computers to understand what is being written or spoken about a process, with the help of a machine learning model, is also becoming important. Notably, this particular trend is rapidly decreasing the need for users to type on a device’s screen, thereby increasing convenience.

Meanwhile, the digital transformation has also led to an increased need for cybersecurity in order to better protect important data and information. The report mentioned that AI will assist security departments in organizing a “digital shield to protect data from malicious attacks.” Separately, the Internet of Things is another area where AI is set to gain prominence as it helps to monitor ""the performance of various interconnected gadgets.”

In fact, per a report by the International Data Corporation (“IDC”), global spending on artificial intelligence is estimated to reach $110 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.1% from 2019 to 2024. Notably, the report mentioned that the main drivers behind the adoption of AI will be delivering a better customer experience and helping employees improve at their jobs.

Moreover, the report mentioned that retail and banking are set to spend the most on AI solutions during the forecast period. While the retail industry will focus on improving customer experience through chatbots and recommendation engines, the banking sector will focus on fraud analysis and investigation, among others. Notably, IDC stated that the United States is set to deliver more than half of all the spending on AI during the forecast period.

3 Stocks to Keep an Eye On

AI looks set to continue disrupting the technology sector and in turn, influence the ways in which businesses and users function as it is becoming increasingly present in varied activities that we engage in. From automation to delivering personalized recommendations and chatbots, leading to higher customer satisfaction, AI is becoming indispensable.

Hence, this makes it a good time to watch out for companies focused on AI that can make the most of this continued upswing. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Microsoft develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide. Notably, businesses can use the company’s Azure AI platform for the development of AI solutions. Moreover, in 2019, the company invested $1 billion in San Francisco-based research lab OpenAI, for the development of artificial general intelligence.

The company also has its own virtual assistant named Cortana. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 8.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current- year is 27.4%.

Micron Technology designs, manufactures, and sells memory and storage products worldwide. Notably, the company’s products like high-capacity memory and multichip power packages are used to power AI training and inference engines whether in cloud, or embedded in mobile and edge devices. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 11.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 36.4%.

Amazon engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. Notably, the company has its own AI voice assistant Alexa which brings customers increased convenience. Moreover, the company also has its Amazon Web Services platform which offers tools for businesses in order to create machine learning solutions.

Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 8.4% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.1%.

Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation

Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.

A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks’ just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is only available for a limited time.

189,2021-02-09T13:55:16+00:00,$15 an hour minimum wage may hammer these big retailers — here are the numbers,"The dollar store models of Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) — essentially to pay workers federal minimum wages and move cheaply sourced merchandise at high volume — may be put to the test should a new Democrat proposal to lift the minimum wage to $15 an hour gain steam.

Dollar General and Dollar Tree could be forced to shell out as much as $700 million and $500 million, respectively, more in annual wages by 2025, according to new research out of Jefferies (see charts below) if The Raise the Wage Act of 2021 goes through as proposed. The act calls for gradually raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour currently to $15 an hour by 2025.

“A minimum wage increase would put more money in the hands of Dollar General and Dollar Tree’s customers, but it would also increase costs for the retailers,” warns Jefferies analyst Randal Konik. “Note, Dollar General and Dollar Tree employ roughly 157,000 and 193,000 employees (full-time and part-time combined), respectively.” The impact of rising wages on dollar stores will be felt.

The federal minimum wage hasn’t been raised since 2009 despite across the board inflation in things like rent payments and medical costs. And the dollar stores have continued to pay those meager wages in their most densely populated locations.

“In our analysis, we found that in states where Dollar General is most concentrated (i.e. >50% of the company's store base is located in 10 states), the current average minimum wage is $7.79. In states where Dollar Tree is most concentrated (i.e. > 50% of the banner's store base is located in 10 states), the current average minimum wage is $9.36. In states where Family Dollar is most concentrated (i.e. > 50% of the banner's store base is located in 9 states), the current average minimum wage is $8.43,” Konik points out.

Dollar Tree operates more than 15,600 stores in 48 states, while Dollar General clocks in with about 17,000 stores in 46 states.

But the winds of change are starting to blow in the faces of the dollar stores.

Story continues

President Biden has swung the door wide open on the minimum wage debate in the early days of his presidency. He called for it to be included in a new $1.9 trillion stimulus plan designed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, although he has recently backed off on having it stuffed into the recovery plan. Democrats have since proposed The Raise the Wage Act of 2021.

In November 2020, Florida voters approved a ballot measure to gradually lift the minimum wage to $15 by 2026. The lowest paid workers in the state now earn $8.65 an hour, up from $8.56 an hour in 2020. It will move to $10 an hour on Sept. 30.

A total of 20 states raised their minimum wages on Jan. 1 as they march to the $15 an hour mark, Yahoo Finance Ben Werschkul writes. Here's a look at the wage structures at Dollar General and Dollar Tree.

The rising cost of labor could force the dollar stores to find clever ways to protect profits, seeing as they can’t exactly raise prices too much. They could slash inventory to contain costs, slowdown the pace of new store openings or venture further into new categories such as fresh food. Another option could be to expand the number of well-known national brands in a bid to get customers to spend more (and those employees who will have those higher hourly wages).

Konik believes Dollar General should be able to navigate the likely wage inflation.

“Dollar General could be better equipped to offset a potential rise in wages given the company's long list of top-line and margin enhancing initiatives (DG Fresh, NCI, Fast Track, Digital, etc.). Dollar Tree’s initiatives (DT Plus! at DT and H2 remodels at FD) should be beneficial to the company's top-line and profitability, helping to mitigate potential headwinds, but we recognize that the Dollar Tree banner is still in the early innings of DT Plus!, which we believe could be a meaningfully positive catalyst for the banner, in time, if executed properly,” Konik says.

191,2021-02-09T10:00:39+00:00,Wall Street Is Investing Billions to Scale Tiny Mom-and-Pop Sellers on Amazon,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the biggest names on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley—JPMorgan Chase, Advent International, Khosla Ventures among them—are pumping billions of dollars into mom-and-pops selling everything from tea kettles to jock itch remedies on Amazon.com Inc.

Investment banks, venture firms and private equity shops are backing so-called Amazon aggregators—often led by e-commerce veterans—that are betting they can take up-and-coming sellers, who often operate out of their garages, and transform them into global brands. The aggregators say they have the expertise to select strong products and avoid faddish ones that flame out before they have a chance to grow.

The latest entrant, Branded Group, said Tuesday it had purchased 20 houseware and leisure brands. Formed last summer and flush with $150 million raised by the Berlin venture firm Target Global, Branded will be run by Pierre Poignant, who previously led the southeast Asian online marketplace Lazada, and Michael Ronen, who spent almost 20 years in mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs and was a founding partner of SoftBank’s Vision Fund.

“We want to be a multi-billion dollar company,” says Poignant, who oversaw the sale of Lazada to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Poignant acknowledges that “buying businesses is one thing. Scaling them is another.”

About 40 Amazon aggregators have emerged in the past few years, according to people following the trend, with most of them still quietly seeking deals behind the scenes. Eight have announced fundraising rounds totaling more than $2.5 billion since 2019.

Thrasio, launched in 2018, has the deepest pockets and has already purchased 90 companies with $1.75 billion in funding and debt from backers that include the private-equity firm Advent International. Perch, founded in 2020, has raised $130 million and gobbled up almost 30 brands. Several private equity firms have launched websites to court Amazon sellers without disclosing how much they’ve designated to buy them.

The demand for Amazon mom-and-pops reflects the maturation of the e-commerce giant’s third-party marketplace, which accounts for more than half of all products sold on the site. The web store has grown so large that deep-pocketed investors can prospect for tomorrow's big hit among the millions of merchants competing on the site. “The emergence of these companies reflects how selling with Amazon offers small businesses powerful opportunities to build their brands and reach millions of customers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email.

Thrasio, based in Walpole, Massachusetts, was early to the game but has attracted well-financed competition since the pandemic pushed millions of consumers online, possibly changing shopping habits forever. The news that Thrasio had surpassed a $1 billion valuation in June pulled in even more investors.

Aggregators look for consistent money-makers with annual sales up to about $10 million; they generally offer three to four times a target’s annual profit, including the salary the owners pay themselves. The buyers don’t focus on specific categories the way a Procter & Gamble Co. does but are content to jam together a potpourri of brands. Perch, for example, sells maternity belts, auto upholstery tools, peppermint-based athlete’s foot cures and virtual-reality headsets.

The synergies happen on the back-end, where experts in global logistics, search engine optimization and Amazon advertising can apply their knowhow to any profitable product with good reviews. Beyond expertise, the aggregators have the funds mom-and-pop businesses often lack to expand internationally. The aggregators also consolidate their purchasing power with manufacturers and shipping companies to negotiate lower prices.

“Amazon sellers are salivating right now because all of these investors are lining up around the block to buy them,” says James Thomson, a former Amazon executive who now advises online merchants. “Many many more aggregators will emerge before this starts to slow down.”

The gold rush is happening despite perceptions that Amazon is a hostile environment where merchants can be kicked off after a few bad reviews or bogus counterfeiting charges and sometimes spend months trying to get reinstated. Over the years, some sellers have built decent businesses only to watch Amazon start selling its own versions of their products.

The aggregators say those risks are real but worth taking given the potential rewards of being on a site that captures almost 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S., a figure they expect to keep growing even as stores reopen and people get vaccinated for Covid-19.

Their north star is Anker Innovations Technology Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that started selling cell phone chargers on Amazon and grew into a global electronics brand worth more than $10 billion whose products have graduated from Amazon’s web store to the shelves at Walmart Inc. and Target Corp.

“Amazon is building a massive economy comparable to the gross domestic product of entire countries,” says Branded’s Ronen. “I mostly see an opportunity to partner with them. Our interests are aligned.”

For Amazon merchants who can’t afford to expand or are simply burned out, the swarm of aggregators offer a viable exit strategy. Tony and Carol Meibock, a husband and wife team from Calgary, Canada, carved out a niche selling soaps and foot soaks made from peppermint and tea tree oil to treat dry skin, jock itch and athlete’s foot. With annual sales in the millions of dollars and their company, Truremedy Naturals, turning a profit, Tony quit his software job to help run the business.

Then demand surged during the pandemic, and the couple found themselves working nonstop to resolve one supply-chain headache after another. To keep growing required hiring more people, which would have hurt profits and made the company worth less to a buyer. Tony Meibock, 54, had already made connections with potential acquirers in the tight-knit community of online merchants, so it wasn’t hard to spread word that he was interested in selling. His phone and his email inbox blew up.

Not that it was easy letting go of a business they’d built. “My wife was attached to it. It was her baby. But we also realized we needed a break,” he says. “Of course we wanted to make some money, but we cared about the brand and wanted to leave it in good hands.”

He spoke with about five interested parties last summer and sold to Perch in January for undisclosed terms. Carol is enjoying time with the grandkids; Tony will try advising other firms that sell on Amazon. Ski trips are on the agenda.

Perch was founded by Chris Bell, a Boston entrepreneur who learned how to value businesses while working in mergers and acquisitions at Bain & Co. Later, he got e-commerce experience running Wayfair Inc.’s delivery operations. Bell attended a New York conference for Amazon sellers in 2019 and was surprised to encounter big crowds at a session on how to sell your business. The attendees had the same manufacturing and shipping problems he had learned to solve, and Bell got interested in rolling up sellers.

He half hoped friends would talk him out of it. Instead, a pal pulled up the Amazon website, searched for faucets and marveled that obscure brands dominated the results. Kohler Co., a mainstay at home-improvement chains, was nowhere to be found.

“All of these big brands with all of these advertising dollars don’t dominate Amazon,” Bell says. “It's just a different playing field. The winners are these small guys who don’t have enough capital to expand into Europe.”

He went out on his own and connected with Alex Finkelstein at Spark Capital. An early Wayfair investor who watched the furniture and housewares store prosper despite Amazon, Finkelstein knew there was room for many companies to do well online. “I view Amazon as a partner and not a competitor,” he says.

Once an aggregator buys a business, typical first steps include finding more inventory to expand into Europe and Australia. Bigger factory orders help them negotiate better prices with manufacturers, materials suppliers and shippers. Sometimes small changes go a long way. Perch squeezed silicon straws into smaller packages and shaved 5% off Amazon’s shipping fees. And sometimes it’s a matter of deploying data scientists to determine how much to spend on advertising and search terms to maximize sales and profits.

It’s not always smooth. Amazon suspended a maternity belt brand from the site three weeks after Perch purchased it. For reasons that remain unclear, Amazon suspected the products were counterfeit and halted all sales for two months, costing the aggregator about $500,000 in sales. “No one got much sleep,” Bell says. Finally, Amazon turned the spigot back on. Aggregators can take such body blows since their sales are spread over more brands, he says. “Now we know where the landmines are.”

Thrasio is already a relatively big business. The aggregator has rolled up more than 90 companies that sell more than 15,000 products, mostly on Amazon. The company says it generated more than $100 million in profit on $500 million in sales last year. Co-founder Josh Silberstein says small Amazon businesses tend to see their margins decline as sales grow from $1 million to $10 million because they suddenly need expensive outside help to resolve logistical issues, legal matters and customer service.

“As they get bigger, they get less good at covering all of these different functions,” Silberstein says. Thrasio is set up to handle such challenges for multiple products. It also created a streamlined system to quickly determine the value of an Amazon business so Thrasio can close an acquisition in as little as 35 days, a sweetener for moms and pops looking to get out.

As more aggregators pour into the market, bidding wars are breaking out, and prices have spiked more than 30% in the past year, according to people involved in deals. So far, acquirers are willing to pay for proven Amazon brands, says Mark Daoust, whose Quiet Light Brokerage closed 70 transactions totaling $110 million in 2020, up 40% from the previous year and expects to close more than 100 deals this year.

Idan Barzilay, 39, a Tel Aviv mechanical engineer who started selling virtual-reality smartphone headsets on Amazon a few years ago, was all set to offload his company last year. Then the buyer backed out when the pandemic hit. No matter. Sales of Barzilay’s headsets took off because homebound parents were desperate to distract their kids—even if it meant more screen time. Soon his company was more valuable than ever, and he sold to Perch for confidential terms.

“The sellers, we are like fish in a lake,” Barzilay says. “There are a lot of fishermen, which means it gets harder and harder for them to catch a nice fish.”

With Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO of Amazon.com, let’s reflect on the company’s performance under his management. While he’s only a stock tick or two away from being the richest person in the world, during his tenure Amazon’s stock market results come in a distant second to Monster Beverage, the energy drink maker.

Amazon’s stock performance since IPO

Why don’t we have an ideal mask yet?

A $1,000 investment in Amazon’s stock at its IPO on May 15, 1997, would be worth $2.2 million today. A $1,000 investment in Hansen’s Natural Corp—what Monster was called in 1997—would be worth $3.9 million. A distant third is Apple, where those $1,000 in shares would be worth $1.1 million today. These calculations include stock splits and the reinvestment of dividends, though Monster and Amazon didn’t issue any payments to investors during the time period.

Amazon’s changing business model

China is marching closer to a population crisis

Amazon’s business has expanded significantly since its market debut. At the time, it reported $15.7 million in annual sales and Dow Jones Newswires described the company as “an upstart that made a flashy business out of selling books over the Internet.” In 2020, the company made $386 billion in sales while operating its own multi-national parcel-delivery fleet, offering services to control satellites, and running a streaming entertainment platform.

Monster Beverage’s outsized profits

Hansen’s $1.3 million of profit on $43 million sales in 1997 came primarily from carbonated fruit-juice drinks made without additives like caffeine or artificial coloring. The intervening years have led it to sell off non-energy drink divisions to Coca-Cola, change its name to Monster, and grow profit to a cumulative $1.2 billion on $4.4 billion in sales in its four most recently reported quarters.

You can skip our detailed discussion of today's financial markets and the importance of hedging against risk and go to 5 Best Low-Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now.

Given the uncertainty in financial markets, a raging pandemic and joblessness, investors are becoming extremely risk-averse. Low-risk stocks present a great opportunity in such situations. A low-risk stock is defined as a stock with a small possibility of losing a portion or all of your investments. However, most of these stocks have a low amount of upside potential and might not provide an investor with the growth needed to meet long-term goals. But the fact remains that no stock is ever 100% risk-free. This is why investing in these stocks can be tricky. If an investor chooses to invest at the right time, these stocks have the ability to post strong rewards. 10 Best Low-Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies were forced to shut down resulting in an increased number of unemployed individuals. Nearly 500,000 individuals lost their jobs due to the coronavirus crisis. Most investors considered low-risk stocks that offer dividends to compensate for the loss. Dividend stocks are considered fixed-income assets where investors are paid regularly; monthly, quarterly, annually. (Please also see 15 Best Dividend Stocks with Upside Potential). Dividends still provide a steady stream of income for millions of Americans, especially those who are retired. Dividend stocks are usually less risky, as dividend-paying companies are mature, with low uncertainty and flux.

The pandemic further elevated the importance of adding some low-risk stocks to a portfolio. A good investor knows the balance of risk and rewards mostly during these times. Consider a company in a good financial shape that is essential even during an economic recession. Brian Belski, BMO’s chief investment strategist, recommends buying low-risk stocks as he foresees a sudden drop in equities in the next few months. Belki said in a note,

“We believe the heightened levels of volatility that investors were forced to contend with last month will likely return in the coming months, and is one of the reasons we do not see U.S. stocks breaking out of their range and making a sustained move higher before the year is done,”

Today’s market has become more volatile than ever. In order to identify the 14 Best Low-Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now, we started with 100 holdings in the SPLV – Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF as of February 3, 2021.

Given the uncertainty in financial markets, a raging pandemic and joblessness, investors are becoming extremely risk-averse. Low-risk stocks present a great opportunity in such situations. A low-risk stock is defined as a stock with a small possibility of losing a portion or all of your investments. However, most of these stocks have a low amount of upside potential and might not provide an investor with the growth needed to meet long-term goals. But the fact remains that no stock is ever 100% risk-free. This is why investing in these stocks can be tricky. If an investor chooses to invest at the right time, these stocks have the ability to post strong rewards. 10 Best Low-Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies were forced to shut down resulting in an increased number of unemployed individuals. Nearly 500,000 individuals lost their jobs due to the coronavirus crisis. Most investors considered low-risk stocks that offer dividends to compensate for the loss. Dividend stocks are considered fixed-income assets where investors are paid regularly; monthly, quarterly, annually. (Please also see 15 Best Dividend Stocks with Upside Potential). Dividends still provide a steady stream of income for millions of Americans, especially those who are retired. Dividend stocks are usually less risky, as dividend-paying companies are mature, with low uncertainty and flux.

The pandemic further elevated the importance of adding some low-risk stocks to a portfolio. A good investor knows the balance of risk and rewards mostly during these times. Consider a company in a good financial shape that is essential even during an economic recession. Brian Belski, BMO’s chief investment strategist, recommends buying low-risk stocks as he foresees a sudden drop in equities in the next few months. Belki said in a note,

Tesco has called for a 1 per cent sales tax to be levied on Amazon and other digital retail giants as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hit high street jobs.

Bosses from 18 UK supermarkets, high street chains and retail property owners have called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to overhaul the current tax system in order to put them on a “level playing field” with online rivals.

They have also demanded a permanent reduction in business rates, which retail, leisure and hospitality firms have not had to pay for the current financial year after the government launched a tax holiday at the start of the pandemic.

But the property tax is set to resume in April for the new financial year, despite non-essential retailers remaining shut due to lockdown restrictions.

Several essential retailers, including the UK’s six largest supermarket chains, handed their rates relief worth more than £2bn back to the state.

However, retailers have now said a failure to reform the rates system in the next budget would “hamper the recovery of the retail sector post-pandemic, potentially putting thousands of jobs at risk”.

Nearly 15,000 retail jobs have been lost already this year and “there will be many more to come”, warned the letter, which was also signed by Asda chief Roger Burnley and Morrisons chief David Potts.

The coalition of retailers and landlords said reform should ensure online retailers pay similar levels of tax to brick and mortar firms.

Their letter said: “Reducing business rates for retailers and rebalancing the tax system to ensure online retailers pay a fair share of tax would be revenue-neutral, provide a vital boost to bricks and mortar retailers and support communities in need of levelling up.”

While it falls short of specifically calling for an online sales tax, Tesco has renewed its demand for the biggest online retailers to be hit with a 1 per cent levy and said business rates should be reduced by a fifth.

A spokesperson for Tesco said: “Our stores and our colleagues do a fantastic job serving customers and communities every day.

Story continues

“We have seen over the years how the burden of business rates has increased and how this burden is felt more heavily in areas of the UK that are most in need of investment and levelling up.

“We believe strongly that there should be a level playing field for all retailers, online or physical, which is why we propose a 1 per cent online sales levy for businesses with annual revenues over £1m, in addition to a 20 per cent reduction in business rates.

“Now is the opportunity to reform business rates and create a system that is fair and sustainable for all.”

The government is reportedly considering an “excessive profits tax” for Amazon and other firms that have made considerable gains during the past year of lockdowns.

The Sunday Times said No 10 is working on proposals for a one-off windfall tax that would affect major businesses that have seen above average profits following a surge in online deliveries during the pandemic.

The latest call for an online sales levy comes days after Amazon revealed their UK sales had rocketed by 51 per cent to £19.3bn in 2020 as more people shopped online during lockdown.

Waterstones managing director James Daunt, who also signed the letter, said business rates on shops are a “perverse tax, perversely applied”.

“It is starkly evident that they result in the loss of jobs and the degradation of communities most in need of support,” he said.

“They are indefensible in their present form, with the immediate consequence of failure to reform the certain loss of tens of thousands of valuable jobs.”

203,2021-02-08T12:58:09+00:00,Delhi High Court lifts hold on Future's $3.4 billion retail deal in setback for Amazon,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Monday overturned an order that had stalled Future Group's $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets, two sources said, in a setback for Future's partner Amazon.com Inc, which has challenged the sale.

A New Delhi court last week sided with the U.S. online retailer and put Future's asset sale to Reliance Industries on hold, leading to an appeal from the Indian retail group.

A two-judge bench hearing Future's appeal on Monday put on hold the previous ruling, which had effectively stalled the mega retail deal, two sources familiar with the proceedings said.

Future in its appeal had said its creditors would be at ""significant risk"" if the Reliance deal failed.

""It is a major setback for Amazon,"" said one of the sources.

In a fight between two of the world's richest men - Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani - the U.S. giant has argued that Future breached certain 2019 contracts by agreeing to the deal with Reliance. Future has denied any wrongdoing.

Amazon has argued in the New Delhi courts that an October decision by an arbitrator who had put the Reliance deal on hold is enforceable. Future has maintained that its retail unit was not party to the arbitration agreement and the order was not binding on the company.

The two-judge Delhi bench agreed that Future's retail unit was not a party to the arbitration agreement invoked by Amazon, Future said, welcoming the order in a filing to stock exchanges.

Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A detailed written order has yet to be made public.

Future is India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, and agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year.

205,2021-02-08T10:34:58+00:00,SoftBank’s Vision Fund Profit Undercut by Trading Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. reported a record profit in its Vision Fund as a surging stock market lifted the value of its portfolio companies, but founder Masayoshi Son wiped out a significant chunk of those gains with his controversial trading in derivatives.

The Vision Fund reported a 844.1 billion yen ($8 billion) profit in the December quarter, surpassing record numbers set just a quarter earlier. A global rally in technology shares has boosted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and paved the way for initial public offerings from the likes of DoorDash Inc.

Those gains, which had been widely expected, were offset by fallout from Son’s decision last year to start dabbling in trading stocks and options. SoftBank posted a 285.3 billion yen derivatives loss in the period. That led to an overall loss in the asset management arm of 113.5 billion yen, up from 85.2 billion yen in the previous three-month period.

“The Vision Fund’s stellar performance in the past few quarters continues to cover for the losses on options trading,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “SoftBank could argue those derivatives were for hedging purposes, but Son’s venture into trading is definitely not looking good so far.”

In a presentation to investors after the results, Son focused on his successes. He reprised his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! two decades ago, to companies like Uber and DoorDash more recently. Some 15 companies have gone public from the Vision Fund so far, he said.“Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said, pacing a stage in a white turtleneck sweater and grey jacket. “We are finally in the harvesting stage.”

He said Vision Fund 1 and Vision Fund 2 have invested in a total of 131 companies. In the case of DoorDash, SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake now worth about $9 billion, he said, while its $7.7 billion investment in Uber is worth $11.3 billion.

The Tokyo-based company had a net income of 1.17 trillion yen in the December period and did not release operating profit figures. At least six more portfolio companies are planning IPOs this year.

“There is a lot of liquidity out there and investors are particularly partial toward tech stocks,” Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “At some point the IPO fatigue sets in, but doesn’t seem like we are there yet. For now, the window of opportunity is open for SoftBank.”

After shares plunged in March with the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank unveiled plans to sell off 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and fund buybacks. The selloff included part of its interests in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion.

SoftBank held a total of $22 billion of “highly liquid listed stocks” as of the end of quarter, including a $7.39 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc., $3.28 billion in Facebook Inc. and $1.38 billion in Alphabet Inc. The operation is managed by its asset management subsidiary SB Northstar, where Son personally holds a 33% stake.

The investments were accompanied by derivatives that amplified exposure, but SoftBank has been winding down its options strategy amid a backlash from investors. The fair value of SoftBank’s futures and options positions came to little over $1 billion at the end of December, compared with $2.7 billion the previous quarter. Long call options on listed stocks have dwindled to $1.68 billion from $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks declined to $238 million from $1.26 billion of value.

Son said that the losses in the asset management arm have swung to a profit of about 100 billion yen since the end of last quarter. But the operations remain in a “test-drive stage,” he said.

Alibaba, Son’s most stark investment success to date and SoftBank’s largest asset, saw its shares plunge about 20% last quarter amid a Chinese government clampdown that scuttled the planned listing of its affiliate Ant Group Co. Founder Jack Ma had all but vanished from public view, prompting investor unease before he resurfaced last month.

Son said he remained in touch with Ma, without giving specific details of their communications. He said Ma likes to draw and shares his drawings with Son via chat; the SoftBank chief also sketches but hasn’t shared any of his work. Son also said he saw the increased antitrust scrutiny of Ma’s businesses in China as part of the country’s natural evolution.

SoftBank’s own sale of Arm to Nvidia is still making its way through the approval process gauntlet. The United Kingdom and European Union are both preparing to launch probes into the deal, the Financial Times reported last week. Son said he remained confident that it will receive a green light at the end.

SoftBank has also joined the blank-check company frenzy with plans for several special purpose acquisition companies. SVF Investment Corp. raised $525 million last month to address sectors like mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies and software. LDH Growth Corp I plans to raise as much as $200 million to target Latin American and Hispanic markets.

SoftBank last week filed for two more SPACs, seeking to raise another $630 million. The new SoftBank vehicles, SVF Investment Corp. 2 and 3, will target the same diverse areas of technology as the first, including mobile communications and artificial intelligence, according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“Consistently good performance by Vision Fund portfolio companies also helps the SPAC’s prospects because investors can extrapolate management expertise,” said Tang at United First Partners. “It underlines their skill in deploying capital.”

SoftBank may see between 10 to 20 public listings a year from its portfolio of 164 startups across three different funds, Son said. A typical early-stage venture capital fund might see a third of its bets pay off, but SoftBank’s portfolio of late-stage companies should do better than that, he said. Even WeWork has received SPAC interest, he said.

The billionaire struck a tone that was reminiscent of the days before the WeWork fiasco in late 2019. He said the key to turning “white egg” investments into golden egg hits was “turbo-charging” startups with “overwhelming capital,” more ambitious goals and synergies with other portfolio companies.

Son’s presentation then took a turn for the comical. He flipped to an animated slide of a goose tagged with “AI revolution” text and a line of golden eggs marching out of its backside to Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker.

“Investment is a rhythm,” Son said. “But please don’t look at this too seriously.”

While working an office job from 9 - 5 has historically been the normal way to go for most people, especially those without trusts or wealth. After all, when you don't know where your next meal will come from if you stop getting even a couple of paychecks, then you can't really afford to risk anything and start your own business, with the added caveat that only a few businesses or startups survive and flourish.

However, here's the good news. As technology has continued advancing, the world has become more and more globalized, which means a lot more opportunities for people. Further, entrepreneurship has also been encouraged in most countries across the world as the more businesses you have, the better the economy and employment statistics, leading to a higher standard of living. I'm sure many people have had brilliant ideas without resources or the connections to bring these ideas to life, which in turn means that we have lost out on my such brilliant ideas. 15 most successful products from Shark Tank

To successfully start or even maintain a business, you need capital. Capital refers to the investments made into the company by the owners of the company, and this capital is used initially to fund expenses, both of an operating nature as well as a capital nature. Operating expenses refer to expenses which are made on a day to day basis for the running of the company, while capital expenses refer to the purchases of physical assets such as land, plants, vehicles and machinery, where such expenditure is used to buy things which will be used for several years in the future. And this is why having capital at the start is so important. Unless the business is exceptional and there are exceptional circumstances, you will not be making profits in the first year or even the first few years. And if you don't have sufficient capital, you will be unable to get the business in the state you need it to be.

Story continues

The good thing is, there are now many different ways to raise capital. Gone are the days where making connections with investors and setting up meetings was the only way to get investors interested in your product. Now, there are websites such as GoFundMe and Kickstarter, where you can crowdfund your project or business. You can simply go to these websites and write about your product and what it aims to do and also mention any extra benefits that the people funding the project will receive. Some of the biggest projects on these websites have received millions of dollars from regular people. In fact, many recent start-up companies have even gone on to become public companies including Trivago (NASDAQ:TRVG), One Medical (NASDAQ:ONEM), Casper (NYSE:CSPR) and Kingsoft Cloud (NASDAQ:KC) among many others.

On the other hand, another option over the last few years is Shark Tank. We live in a time where reality shows are incredibly popular, and major TV channels keep trying to find new scenarios in which to film such reality shows, while led to the creation of Shark Tank. The show itself is the US franchise of a show called Dragon's Den which premiered in Japan all the way back in 2001, while Shark Tank's first season was in 2009.

The show has a panel of judges, who are all incredibly successful businessmen and women, with some of them billionaires and known for their successful investments such as Mark Cuban. Regular people who have an idea for a business or a running business but need more business then pitch their idea to the panel during the show, and based on the pitch, the investors decide whether they want to make the investment or not, and what they're getting in return for making the investment. The show airs on ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and has been extremely popular with viewers which is why it has now been renewed for an 11th successive season.

If the investors (the panel) are interested, they can make a handshake deal, or a gentleman's agreement on an investment. Often, if an idea is really popular, these guys will also try to one up the deal other members of the panel are making, in order to convince the applicant to select them as their investor. If no investor shows interest, then the applicant leaves empty handed. It is of little surprise that the show has attracted so much attention and popularity in the United States, which is the unofficial entrepreneur capital of the world. In fact, around 40,000 companies apply to the show every single season of which only 158 being allowed the opportunity to pitch their product and only 88 being showed on air. While the actual pitches can run up to an hour, the TV show edits and whittles it down to around 11 minutes. The premise of the show is to showcase the drama and tension that occurs during a pitch of a business with the panel often finding faults with the business and can even be brutal in their rejection of the idea.

Of course, that's not to say that the judges are infallible in their knowledge. Many times, ideas and businesses have been rejected which have gone on to achieve great things. But just as often, if not more, the investors have invested in businesses which have gone on to bring a huge return on their initial investment. However, according to judge Kevin O'Leary, around 20% of the handshake deals are never executed in reality, because when the investors do their due diligence, they find out facts and information which makes the investment a bad idea. However, another Shark Robert Herjavec said that most of these rejections come from the entrepreneurs themselves, who only came to the show for publicity and didn't want to actually give up a share of their company. And it is definitely true that simply appearing on Shark Tank can boost a business, in what is now known as the Shark Tank effect.

As I mentioned earlier, many products from Shark Tank have gone on to do really well. To find out these products, we have scoured the internet and various websites including The Pioneer Woman, USA Today and CNBC, to come up with our list. So let's take a look at the products from Shark Tank which have gone on to achieve a lot, starting with number 15:

Appearing on Shark Tank in 2015, PhoneSoap is a UV light sanitizer which has had $46 million in total sales. You simply keep you phone in the box, and the box does the rest, killing of 99.99% of all germs on your phone, which in the days of a pandemic where we have to be extra careful and responsible, seems like a really good idea.

9. Lovepop

You might have thought that pop-up greeting cards were no longer in style but you'd be completely wrong as proven by Lovepop, which was pitched on the 7th season of Shark Tank and got an offer of $300,000 from Kevin O'Leary for 15% of the business, which has over $80 million in sales now.

8. Sleep Styler

Heat free hair rollers is apparently a must-have thing to have. The company appeared in season 8 of Shark Tank, got Lori Greiner's attention It has over $100 million in total sales.

7. The Bouqs

Another Shark Tank reject is The Bouq, even though it is now one of the most successful Shark Tank products. The online flower bouquet seller may not have received any offers of investment from the Sharks during its appearance in Season 5, but it has crossed the $100 million mark in lifetime sales.

6. Tipsy Elves

In 2013, the co-founders of Tipsy Elves appeared on the show, with a premise of selling really ugly sweaters and ended up getting $100,000 for a 10% stake in the company from Herjavec. Total sales of the company exceed $125 million now.

6. The Original Comfy

Why get a blanket and sweatshirt separately if you can get a two in one combo, is the thinking most Americans seem to go with, considering the fact that this blanket sweatshirt mixture has done at least $150 million in sales, and only appeared on Shark Tank relatively recently in 2017.

The luxury department store is so over the tumultuous 12 months caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it earns the honor as first retailer in 2021 to share a post-pandemic financial outlook.

At an investor day Thursday afternoon, Nordstrom (JWN) outlined 2021 sales growth of 25% and “positive” operating profits. Over the long-term, Nordstrom sees revenue growing by a low-single digit percentage from 2019 levels (pre-pandemic) and operating profits increasing at a faster pace of sales.

Although the growth expectations sound aggressive amid the current pandemic environment, Nordstrom CFO Anne Bramman thinks they are achievable.

“We thought we took a really pragmatic approach in some of the guidance that we gave. Clearly, having the stores open is part of the assumption — if you remember, in 2020, a good portion of our stores were closed in the first half,” Bramman — who also sits on the board of spice seller McCormick — told Yahoo Finance Live on the guidance for 2021.

Added Bramman, “We're seeing sequential improvement in our trends. And we have since the second half of the year as we saw stores reopen. And we're continuing to see that sequential improvement. We're seeing that as people think about the vaccine, we've seen that they really are focused on what they're wearing outside of the home. And we're also seeing that consumers continue to show appetite for shopping.” Photo by: John Nacion/STAR MAX/IPx 2020 10/27/20 A view of people with masks on, walking past a Nordstrom Department Store in Midtown. New York City continues Phase 4 of re-opening following restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus on October 27, 2020 in New York City. The fourth phase allows outdoor arts and entertainment, sporting events without fans and media production.

As part of its post pandemic life, Nordstrom sees a $3 billion to $4 billion recovery as people wander back out to stores and continue to shop online after the worst of the health crisis. Some $2 billion to $3 billion in sales are expected to be generated by various company initiatives, such as opening new off-price Rack stores, increasing the amount of online merchandise by 20 times and pushing harder into private label goods.

Despite the upbeat outlook, investors took a wait-and-see approach in the wake of Nordstrom’s investor day. Nordstrom shares were down about 6.5% from Thursday through Friday afternoon trading. Shares are down about 11% over the past year, per Yahoo Finance Premium data.

Story continues

The cautiousness may stem from concerns on the near-term outlook for Nordstrom as the pandemic continues to rage on. It was just two weeks or so ago Nordstrom said sales for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2 fell 22% from a year ago amid challenging store traffic. Digital sales rose 23% from a year earlier. The company guided to operating margins falling by 500 basis points year-over-year due to the net sales drop.

“We were somewhat underwhelmed by the margin outlook,” wrote Deutsche Bank retail analyst Paul Trussell in a note to clients.

A ton of new customers shopping the brand, 1.5 million to be exact. The influx of new customers are shopping online for everything from $4,200 alligator Coach handbags to more affordable sub-$500 handbags, Tapestry’s CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told Yahoo Finance Live.

Online sales surged by about 100% in the quarter in large part to those splurging for leather goods to brighten their days during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our business has been strong,” Crevoiserat said.

Here is how Tapestry performed compared to Wall Street estimates.

Net Sales: $1.69 billion versus $1.63 billion estimate Adjusted Diluted EPS: $1.15 versus $1.00 estimate

Full Year Outlook:

Net Sales: nearly 10% growth Profits: “Strong” bottom line growth for second half of the year

Crevoiserat took over as Tapestry’s CEO in October 2020, and has moved quickly to cut costs via store closures and corporate headcount reductions. She has also sharpened how new accessories are brought to market by leveraging into the company’s treasure trove of data — doing so has helped keep inventory under control and margins solid.

In total, the company expects to realize $300 million in cost savings from its recent restructuring efforts — some $200 million is seen being achieved in the current fiscal year.

The efforts led to strong gains in operating margins at Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman in the most recent quarter, despite sales falling at each. Crevoiserat says the margins gains are sustainable — the Street is banking on it.

“The Tapestry portfolio is beginning to turn a corner. Coach is in the strongest position while Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman are improving their margins. Overall, the entity is showing strong execution and expense discipline which is yielding better profits and rising free cash flow. Numbers have an upward bias ahead and so do the shares,” said Jefferies analyst Randal Konik.

218,2021-02-05T12:50:56+00:00,"Should Amazon Try To Acquire Alibaba, Jumia Or eBay In 2021?","Every week, Benzinga conducts a survey to collect sentiment on what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios.

This week we posed the following question to over 500 traders and investors as to whether Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) should buy another e-commerce company:

Over the next year, should Amazon buy Alibaba, Jumia or eBay?

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (NYSE: BABA) Jumia Technologies AG - ADR (NYSE: JMIA) eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) Buy None

As one of the world’s highest-grossing e-commerce platforms, Amazon is more than retail services alone: streams of revenue for the tech giant also include Kindle, Audible and Music subscriptions as well as its IT service management subsidiary AWS.

See also: How to Buy Amazon Stock

Amazon’s main revenue streams are online product and digital media sales, Amazon Web Services cloud computing, storage and database services, Prime membership fees and other subscription-based services product sales at Whole Foods and other physical store retail formats, and advertising services and co-branded credit cards.

Amazon’s market cap comes in at nearly $1.7 trillion, more than twice Alibaba ($712 billion), eBay ($40 billion) and Jumia’s ($5 billion) market caps combined.

Twenty-six percent of traders and investors believe Amazon should try to acquire Alibaba in 2021.

Alibaba operates China's most-visited online marketplaces: the consumer-to-consumer driven Taobao and business-to-consumer focused Tmall.

Many respondents stated that, although Alibaba is less than familiar in America, the Chinese e-commerce company has a global footprint and the acquisition also has the potential to provide exponential reach for Amazon sellers.

An Amazon-Alibaba M&A would undoubtedly further develop Amazon’s international footprint and enhance economies of scale.

See Also: How To Buy Alibaba Stock.

Around 20% of respondents told us Amazon would be best served completing an M&A deal with eBay by the end of 2021.

Story continues

According to Benzinga readers, the eBay acquisition could be the missing piece for Amazon. An eBay-interwoven auction feature, along with Amazon's warehouse offerings, gives the e-commerce giant the potential to go full spectrum with its ability to service consumers of brand new and secondhand goods.

Twenty-six percent see Jumia as the best fit for a 2021 M&A deal.

A number of respondents told us Jumia is the smallest market cap in an early developing market, and a low-risk aquisition for Amazon. One respondent cited e-commerce retail data by Brookings, which said that “Africa is home to roughly 1.2 billion consumers today, projected to increase to 1.7 billion by 2030. The potential for future growth in retail and consumer spending is, therefore, bright.”

Finally, 40% of respondents believe Amazon should not move forward with an M&A deal in 2021.

Many respondents noted Amazon should instead focus on execution in their current offerings, and were concerned that the FAANG company is already fast approaching if not already in monopoly territory stateside.

This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.

Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.

The People’s Republic of China has evolved into one of the richest countries of the world in just a few decades. According to data published by the World Bank in 2019, the Gross Domestic Product or GDP of China has had a sharp increase since 1990, with the number climbing almost exponentially. David Mann, global chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, commented on this rapid economic growth, stating that ""From the end of the 1970s onwards we've seen what is easily the most impressive economic miracle of any economy in history.""

This success can be accredited to a number of reasons. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, beginning the boom of Chinese goods in World trade. Research published by London School of Economics further illustrated this massive increase. By 1985, exports were $25 billion, $15 billion more than what they were 9 years ago in 1976. Just 25 years later, in 2010, exports valued at an amount of $3 trillion dollars; 300 times more than what the value was in 1985.

As trade between nations increased, so did the Chinese public’s interest in entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur is someone who participates in the act of setting up a business, while also bearing the effects of this risk in hope of a profit. A good business idea has the power to rake in millions but getting to that point where profit is being generated consistently can be a long, difficult journey. 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs

Matej Kastelic/Shutterstock.com

The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is one platform which studies entrepreneurial behavior and attitudes of several countries across the world. Data collected in 2019 for China showed that 9.33 percent of the public (ages 18-64) owned an established business. This included those who are owning and managing a running business that has paid salaries, wages, or any other payments to the owners for more than 42 months. The same platform also displayed data on the attitude of Chinese society towards entrepreneurs. Almost 80 percent of people agreed with the statement that in their country, most people consider starting a business as a desirable career choice.

Story continues

All this evidence points towards the fact that in general, entrepreneurs are viewed in a quite favorable light by the Chinese public. Because of this, those entrepreneurs who have a considerable reach may have the distinct power of influencing those around them. Whether this is by inspiring the population with their success story, or by introducing a revolutionary idea through their product, Chinese entrepreneurs have affected the general public in one way or another.

For this reason, we have prepared a list of the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs. To prepare their ranking, we have used Fortune China and Forbes as our source, ranking each business leader based on not only their company’s success, but also their influence on the general public. Let us look at the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs, starting with number 12.

12. Zhang Jindong

Date of Birth: March 28, 1963 (age 57 years)

Occupation: Co-founder and Chairman of Suning

Net Worth: $62.1 billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)

The first person to grace our list of 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs is 57-year-old Zhang Jindong. Zhang is the chairman of Suning.com, one of the largest retailers in China, and is said to be among the top 3 in the Chinese e-commerce industry. Zhang has certainly come a long way from when he first started the company in 1998 as an air-conditioning store. Throughout the years, he has diverged into many markets, moving from air conditioning to home appliances to online shopping. Zhang is also the owner of a privately-held company called Suning Holdings Group, which is particularly famous for having acquired the famous Italian football club Inter Milan.

221,2021-02-04T16:04:25+00:00,Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Top 10 Stock Holdings,"In this article we take a look at billionaire Ken Griffin’s top 10 stock holdings. You can skip our discussion of Ken Griffin’s Citadel’s performance, the GameStop episode and some important stocks bought by Citadel and go directly to Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Top 5 Stock Holdings.

Kenneth Griffin is an American billionaire and hedge fund manager who oversees Citadel LLC, which has over $35 billion in managed funds. A business enthusiast and creative genius since childhood, Griffin went to Harvard College in 1986, where he started investing. Soon, Griffin spotted inefficiencies in the convertible bonds market. To keep track of real-time stock quotes and data, Griffin convinced administrators to install a satellite dish on the roof of college building. Griffin launched his first investment fund just days after his nineteenth birthday, with $265,000.

Ken Griffin’s Role in GameStop Saga?

The billionaire is in the news for his hedge fund’s role in the GameStop saga that is rattling the U.S. markets for over two weeks now. Citadel recently injected close to $2 billion in the embattled hedge fund Melvin Capital after it sustained heavy losses amid the GameStop short squeeze. Citadel’s link to trading app Robinhood is also being questioned and scrutinized widely. Citadel is one of the biggest revenue sources of Robinhood, as the trading app allegedly shares important data with the hedge fund in exchange for money. In the first quarter of 2020, Robinhood received $100 million from Citadel Securities. In a letter to Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev, U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren asked the executive to explain his link with Citadel and why his app started to put restrictions on GameStop trading. The letter alleged that the hedge fund pays Robinhood to access data about stocks users on the app are buying and selling.

Short Squeeze: Silver Lining for Griffin?

Ken Griffin is also getting attention from Reddit investors for another reason. As the retail traders begun to buy silver to launch a short squeeze — pushing silver prices to their highest levels since 2013 — several members of the Reddit communities warned people to avoid doing that, as Ken Griffin’s hedge fund is one of the biggest shareholders of the iShares Silver Trust. As of Sept. 30, the fund owns about 6 million shares of the ETF.

A Master at Stock-Picking

Despite the recent controversies, Ken Griffin remains a master at stock-picking. In 2020, his investments in oil, power, natural gas and agriculture markets returned $1 billion. Citadel’s Wellington fund, which invests in stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities, was up 21.2% in 2020 through November, according to a Reuters report. Despite extreme volatility, Citadel gained 27% in 2020 through November, marking the hedge fund’s second consecutive year of double-digit returns. The hedge fund returned over 30% in 2019. Over the last two years, Citadel bought assets several collapsing and distressed hedge funds, including Amaranth Advisors LLC and Sowood Capital Management LP.

9. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)

Citadel is one of the 79 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey having stakes in Micron. The fund owns 8 million shares of the semiconductor company. The total value of this stake is $375.75 million. Micron shares are gaining ground after Samsung said that a strong recovery in the DRAM market is expected.

Micron recently posted upbeat fiscal Q1 results. The company’s CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the company is excited about the DRAM industry fundamentals.

Here's what Bonsai Partners said about MU shares in their Q3 Investor Letter:

“New Investment: Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU)

Situation Overview

If there’s one investment mistake I’ve made multiple times in my career it’s accepting lower quality businesses available at attractive prices. I hope I’m not repeating this mistake again with Micron.

Acquiring a low-quality business at a great price usually does not lead to great investment returns, but neither does a great business at a low-quality price. You have to have both to earn superior returns.

I view Micron’s share price is quite attractive, but I also believe the business is transitioning from being mediocre to rather good. If that happens, attractive returns should follow.

Historically, Micron has not been kind to shareholders, and its shares are currently priced to reflect this. However, I believe that the nature of the DRAM industry has structurally changed for the better.

From a high-level, what makes Micron attractive is how essential it is to human progress. Without getting too professorial, humanity has had multiple waves of productivity gains over the past 12,000 years.

The first big improvement in productivity came from the agricultural revolution, which allowed humans to shift from hunting and gathering into high productivity farming and the division of labor.

The second wave of human productivity came from the industrial revolution, which harnessed machines to perform repetitive tasks on our behalf.

We are now in the third wave of human productivity: the information age. Like the machines of the industrial revolution, silicon chips are now automating and simplifying information-driven tasks.

Each of these waves relied on certain enabling resources; those that had them thrived, and those that did not fell behind. In the agricultural revolution, the enabling resources were arable land and nutrient-rich grains. In the industrial revolution, it was fossil fuels. And in the information revolution, it is silicon chips.

If you’re wondering why the United States government recently imposed restrictions on Chinese use of U.S. semiconductor technology (such as in the case of Huawei) – this action is like taking control of the world’s oil fields during the industrial revolution. It’s a way to keep China in check and maintain dominance of the global economy.

Micron makes memory; the chips that allow a computing system to store information (either temporarily or on a longer-term basis). Memory chips are quite different from the most commonly thought of semiconductors: logic chips, which have the job of processing data. Memory chips don’t process data, instead, their job is to feed data into processing chips, similar to a hopper in a factory, or a storage unit. Without memory, computers can’t function, and human productivity stalls.

Similar to our investment in Taiwan Semiconductor, the key to Micron is that they are part of a small cadre that controls the means of chip production. For logic chips, most companies create their own designs but outsource their production to Taiwan Semiconductor. In memory chips, production is vertically integrated; the same companies that design the chips also make the chips.

The DRAM industry has significantly consolidated over the past 10 years, and today there are only three players of consequence remaining – Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung. SK Hynix and Samsung are both Korean, while Micron is American (underscoring Micron’s strategic value to the west).

Each of these memory makers has invested a tremendous amount of capital and expertise into their manufacturing footprint, and without many billions in investment and unincumbered intellectual property, it’s very difficult for a new competitor to emerge. Even though Micron is the third-largest player in DRAM, its capital expenditure budget for the upcoming year is expected to be $9 billion.

Even if you have the money and the intellectual property to reach a cutting edge node, there is tremendous execution required to keep up with market leaders who have decades of experience and know-how. Without that ability, a new player will likely be left behind, chronically unprofitable, and with little to show for its massive investment.

The advantages a Chinese company can bring to the memory business (low cost of labor and lower internal margin requirements) are not meaningful if the unit economics themselves aren’t competitive. In a scale chipmaking operation, the majority of the cost base isn’t due to labor but rather the remaining production costs in each chip (determined by manufacturing yield, technology process, and scale). There is a 20-30% cost difference per chip if you aren’t on-par with your competitors, and this is a 20-40% gross margin industry!

So, from a high level, I was attracted to Micron because it’s an essential business with very high barriers that keep out competitors, but it was also available at a great price.""

8. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY)

New York-based Bristol Myers Squibb is one of billionaire Ken Griffin’s top 10 stock holdings. Griffin’s hedge fund owns 7.11 million shares of the pharmaceutical company, worth $428.41 million. Overall, 124 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of over 800 funds held stakes in the company at the end of September. Bristol shares gained recently after the company shared positive results for its pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating deucravacitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

The Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett’s hedge fund is one of the leading stakeholders in Bristol-Myers. At the end of the third quarter, the fund owned 29.97 million shares of the company, having a total worth of $1.81 billion.

Wedgewood Partners said the following about Bristol shares in their Q4 letter:

“Bristol-Myers Squibb recently reported accelerating sales as much of the medical services industry returned to work. The Company continues to expect double-digit earnings growth over the next few years, driven by existing drugs, in addition to a broad pipeline of new drugs and indications. While the market remains fixated on a couple of patent expirations that could occur over the next several years, we think this is well-known at this point, yet the market still undervalues a couple of key acquisitions the Company has made in the past few years, particularly Celgene, which was acquired for a song.”

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Falling COVID case numbers and ramped-up vaccines offer real hope in the fight against the pandemic. But the job crisis continues to get worse as almost a million people file for unemployment benefits each week. CareerBuilder CEO Irina Novoselsky, who has led the online recruitment company for over three years, knows the job market better than just about anybody.

To get where she is today, she worked 50-hour weeks at Morgan Stanley to put herself through New York University's Stern School of Business and rose quickly up the ranks at the cloud company Novitex. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" Irina joined me to talk about what the recovery will look like, whether more stimulus will make a difference, and how job-seekers can make their application stand out.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Irina Novoselsky. And she is the CEO of CareerBuilder. Irina, nice to see you.

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Good to see you again, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot to talk about on the job front. I guess the big question is the unemployment picture is still pretty bad. How dire is the job market?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: You know, we like to look at it in terms of progress. And we're making some progress. We made a lot of progress in the summer. And really with this holiday wave of COVID, we've seen a big setback. And one of the things that all of our clients are looking to is really to get some certainty around the timeline of the vaccinations and COVID, because one of the things that businesses are looking for in planning their 2021 budget is signs and timelines of stability.

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you a couple of questions about that-- the vaccine-- the rollout being slower than anticipated, is that impacting hiring, do you think?

Story continues

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I think it's a combination of as more and more people are getting COVID or being affected by those in their pods that are getting COVID, we're seeing productivity get impacted. So whether it's more of our employee base is starting to get COVID, or their child care, or their education providers-- and so that's slowly coming through companies at a much higher rate than it was earlier.

And then the combination of really not having a clear timeline yet on the vaccines is helping companies or forcing companies to really think through their hiring timelines. And so it's a few of these starts and stops that we're seeing where hire fast, OK, hold on, let's watch. Hire fast, let's wait and see.

ANDY SERWER: And then also going back to the office, right, I mean, that's being impacted here. How is that affecting hiring plans?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Well, it's definitely impacting candidate plans. One of the things that we surveyed is that 40% of candidates would not work for a company that is not offering a work-from-home option. The searches that we've seen candidates conduct on work-from-home has gone up by 80%. And also the reverse side, employers are putting more flexibility out there.

But one of the conversations that we're not seeing as much is there's really huge parts of the population in really big industries that aren't able to offer a work-from-home option. And so what are those candidates going to be looking at as they consider do they want to go into one of those industries or not?

ANDY SERWER: But does that confer an advantage to those businesses that are having people in offices?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Definitely-- well, an advantage to those that are offering work-from-home. And it's also offering, actually, an advantage to suburban cities. A lot of times middle market companies, small businesses that weren't in major cities were competing with talent with a major zip code. And now, given the flexibility of work-from-home, how we've shown that productivity can sustain itself, all of a sudden, you're seeing middle-sized businesses step up and compete for talent with some of the big guys.

ANDY SERWER: What about seniors in college right now, Irina? That's got to be tough. What are they facing?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: It is really hard, especially one of the things that we spend a lot of time on. And it's really affecting the whole part of the population, but specifically seniors, is they're entering the workforce in this unprecedented. Time many of them will never meet their employers face-to-face. Virtual hiring events, we are doing those for almost every single one of our clients, which means that they're interviewing via Zoom, or Teams, or whatever their communication practice is.

And they also come from this disadvantage in some ways where they might not know how to bring up a resume, because they don't have the experience set. And so we spend a lot of time working with both employers and candidates of, how do you really focus on skills instead of experience?

ANDY SERWER: And how much of this stuff is going to last after COVID?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I think that's the million dollar question, Andy. And some of what we're seeing is the flexibility of it-- of offering that as part of your brand, as part of your values as a company, that's going to last. I think the days of we're 100% at work and 100% at home, those extremes are going to evolve more towards the middle. You might have summer Fridays, you might have a more flexible workforce allowing people to work a little bit more than standard hours. But that flexibility is what candidates are rewarding employers about. So employers are going to be forced to think outside the lines going forward.

ANDY SERWER: I want to get back to the stimulus package. Do you think that's going to make a meaningful difference for the job market?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I think it's going to have to. There's two things that are really happening is that there was a really big part of the frontline employees during the first several months of COVID, and really through July, that weren't looking to go back to work. Because of the stimulus checks that they were getting, they were essentially making more by not putting themselves at-risk in these front-line, COVID-infected industries.

And so as the vaccine comes through the country, that proposition is going to become hopefully less and less attractive, and it's going to force some of these candidates to want to come back to work. And the other side on small businesses is really where we're looking from the other side of the stimulus checks-- you mentioned the candidate side-- but the employer side is also really important, because watching that small and medium-sized business sentiment is really important for the economic recovery that we're all going through. And the last few months, it's declined for small businesses-- that sentiment index that we all follow.

ANDY SERWER: Do you have any thinking on the amount of the stimulus-- too much, too little, or where it should be?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I will tell you that our view, and our clients' views-- and we work with most of the Fortune 500-- is clarity and transparency is more important even than the number-- it's getting out there with a plan and a timeline of how do we get back to some sense of normalcy and stability is what businesses are craving.

ANDY SERWER: Included is the $15 minimum wage. Some people say that kills job growth. What do you think?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: We haven't talked a lot in the media and in general is we spend a lot of time talking about work-from-home roles. But one of the things that this $15 minimum wage starts to open up the conversation around is, what about all those workers that are front-line workers-- that we want them to come back into those industries. We need them in those industries.

And one of the things that we're seeing is a really big migration of those workers not wanting to go into those spaces. They are preferring and opting to go to work-from-home roles-- whether it's call center jobs, whether it's office jobs. And so one of the things that we're seeing is something, a stimulus, to help really even out some of the distribution of the workforce.

ANDY SERWER: Some controversial stuff here, Irina-- some employers have looked to social media to see if prospective employees are members of white national groups or white supremacist groups. Are you hearing about that? And should they do that?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Social media-- and we tell this to the candidates, and we tell this as we work with a lot of hiring practices with our clients-- social media is one of the boxes that almost every single recruiting function we work with checks. So whether you're coming through college and you're graduating, whether you are just out there on social media, you should expect that your potential future employer and your existing employer are checking your social media profiles.

One of the things that has become really important and highlighted more in COVID, and has been important before, is what the company's values are. And so companies are spending a lot more time making sure that not only are they transparently sharing what their values are and continuing to honor those, but also, are their employees doing the same?

And social media is one of those things that it's out there. It's going to keep happening. And if you have something that shouldn't be on there, you shouldn't be posting it. But we as leaders want to make sure that our employees are bearing the values that we have out there.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned companies sort of becoming more political, or at least taking a stand politically, or making those views known. How much of that has to do with signaling to their workers where they stand?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I would say, Andy, that, at least in my view, it's less about the political nature of it, and it's more about the right and wrong. As leaders, one of the things that we not only have a responsibility to our employees, but also as leaders of companies is we have this rare opportunity, especially right now, with what we call the great re-hire, to really change what the workforce looks like in our own companies-- what the faces of our workforce look like.

And so a lot of this is not political. It's, how do we make sure that we have a diverse group of people that are working for us? How do we make sure that it's not just diversity, but also inclusion? And that starts with what we say, how we say it, the holidays that we recommend and that we respect, the words we use, the hiring practices we make. So it's this fulsome and really full view of what it means to be a leader at the company, and as a result, to be employed at that business.

ANDY SERWER: Some people have suggested that former aides to President Trump might have a hard time getting jobs. Do you think that major employers might shut them out?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Again, it depends less on your experience and what your values are and what you did. One of the things that we speak a lot about is you want to make sure that you are pushing forward the right mission, that you are bringing in people that believe in that mission. And that might align with certain companies, and it most likely might not align with all of them.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Back to COVID-19 a little bit, Irina-- the downturn has hurt low income workers more than upper income workers. So it's kind of exacerbating a divide here. Why is that? And what can be done about that, do you think?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: And not only the low income workers-- one of the things that we're also seeing is there's really been a divide around just the race inequality that has been happening. So the unemployment for black Americans is almost double that of white Americans. And so we're seeing, essentially, this hollowing out that that's happening. And as far as what can be done from an employer perspective, it's a few things.

One, you want a diverse workforce, you have to advertise where there is diversity. One of the things that we talk about at CareerBuilder is we happen to be one of the more diverse job boards out there. And so whether it's us or with somebody else, how do you stay in front of where the diverse candidates are?

Two, it's really-- and we touched on this a little bit, Andy, but this is so critical for where we're going, and as we go into this great re-hire and post-COVID years, is really how this openness and flexibility around job mobility. And that comes around the skill set. We for so long have been hiring based on experience. And a lot of what that yields is the same demographic outcome for the same type of roles.

And one of the things that we have to start moving towards is a skill set view instead of experience. And instead of asking, have you done it? Asking, can you do it? And that starts opening up a completely different pool of candidates. I'll give you one experience-- one example that we've done from a technology perspective is as you know, over the first few months of COVID and really over the last few months is flight attendants have been really impacted by the minimal travel that has been happening.

And so there was this whole cohort of workers that were looking for jobs. And so instead of looking on their experience, we did matching based on their skill set, and they had an over 95% match to customer service representatives. So they'd never actually done that role based on their resume or their experience, but they had all the underlying skill sets of communication, of problem solving, of logistics handling.

And it happens that those customer service reps are one of the highest in-demand jobs that we had with not enough supply. And so all of a sudden, you're fixing this market mismatch using technology as long as employers are keeping a little bit more of an open mind around it and also candidates, so that they're not leading with, here's what I've done, and I'll only interview with that. But here's what I can do. And so we're going to have to see a lot more of that to impact a lot of the changes that need to happen.

ANDY SERWER: Interesting stuff. You said something that caught my ear there, Irina, which is the great re-hiring. Is that what you're calling what we hope to see in 2021?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: It is. And it represents not just the bringing back of the American workforce, but also bringing back diversity to all the American companies that are part of this. And so we have spent a lot of time on helping our clients prepare for this great re-hiring. Some of it is just building pipeline, Andy, because a lot of the questions you asked around the stimulus, and the timeline of COVID, and when are we going to be back-- and the answer is, nobody really knows.

And so how do you prepare for this uncertainty-- and a lot of that is building a talent pool so that when we are ready, you have these people to pull from. And we talk about this often-- that in recessions or in economic downturns, the companies that emerge the fastest are those that invest. And whether it's investing in your marketing spend, in your technology, investing in your people can be one of the best returns on investment and one of the most important ones.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of recovery, Irina, what sectors or companies will fare better or worse than what people expect as we recover?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Gaming companies, we're seeing a really big push. We're seeing companies around anything with financial services and insurance services. It's actually stayed-- not only is the recovery expected to be a little better, but we've also seen pretty consistent growth during COVID as well. And then the roles aspect is also really interesting, because sometimes it's not necessarily the industry, but the underlying roles across many different industries.

And around the roles, we're seeing a really big push in software developers, accountants are in a big shortage. So if you're thinking about what to recertify or where to retrain, we post several of these. But there's definitely a lot of these roles that are in high demand and not a lot of supply today.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned flight attendants. What about the poor hospitality business? How is that going to recover? What do you anticipate there?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: We saw some promises of growth in August. And when they started showing up in the top 10, obviously, in Q4, we saw a dip again. But one of the things that hospitalities is looking for is they're also building their pipeline for the future-- that one of the things they're preparing for is instead of a u-shaped recovery, a v-shape. That as soon as people are getting vaccinated, there's an expectation that people are going to hit the hospitality sector pretty quickly-- of wanting to travel, wanting to get out there, because they've been cooped up for the last several months.

So the industries-- those industries particularly are really spending a lot of time with us, of how do they plan to have a workforce get to work really quickly, versus some of the other ones are expecting a little bit more of a u.

ANDY SERWER: I want to go back to the diversity points that you were making a little bit, Irina. And last September, you called gender and race inequality in hiring, disturbing. And have things started to change as the world has changed as we move into 2021, do you think?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Not enough. I will say that the conversation is continuing to stay top of mind, which is really good to hear. One of the things that I continuously talk to CEOs and CHRs of our clients about is they're asking, where can they continue to get diverse talent? And previously, it was something that was a nice to have, a metric that a company was measuring themselves on, but it is much more top of mind and here to stay from a conversation perspective.

But when you look at the data, it's going to be lagging some of the activities that we're seeing. And it's continuing to lag when you look at unemployment, when you look at some of the wage discrepancies, they're really alarming-- that Black Americans are making 61% of median white household income, and that only went up from 57% in the 1970s.

So the progress has been really slow over the last few decades. But I am really hopeful and optimistic based on what I'm hearing that the activity is starting to be not only consistent but very top of mind for many employers.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, do CEOs get this?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: They understand it. And it's one of the most important things that we can do as CEOs. And not only is it good for culture and engagement, but it's also good for your bottom line. There is a lot of studies out there that say when you have a diverse pool of talent compared to your competitors that don't, you're outperforming your P&L by 25% to 30%, your stock prices perform better, your teams work better, you get more innovation. So there's data-- not only is it a good thing from a morale and an employee perspective, it's also just good for business.

ANDY SERWER: Irina, let me shift gears a little bit and ask you about you. You and your parents immigrated from Ukraine when you were young. And my understanding is you started off as a kid washing cars in your neighborhood. How did that shape the way you approach your work and your career?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Andy, I did anything. I sold water bottles at garage sales. You name it, I was doing it. But it shaped it a lot. It shaped-- when I think about when we came here, we came as refugees, as you mentioned, in the late-80s during a recession.

My parents didn't know a lot of English. We weren't able to take almost anything with us, so we came with $270 and a few suitcases. And it was interesting to see just so much of my wanting to really work and help drive CareerBuilder came from that early immigration experience, because how do you translate your work experience if you don't have tools to help you do that?

And so one of the things I would do with my dad-- and he had a PhD in engineering-- and it's hard to figure out how to take mechanical engineering from Russian to turn it into English. And I would watch him send thousands and thousands of resumes out. And it's really inspiring to see now that we're putting technology in front of people that can just literally help them do that translation by putting in the role. And it helps them write their resume for them.

But it's influenced-- every part of my life it's influenced, from a work ethic, from an appreciation perspective, from a hard work mentality. But it's something that stays with you.

ANDY SERWER: And what do you think the keys to your own success are, Irina? What is your-- I mean, sounds like hard work and determination definitely, but what is your key skill set?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: One of the things that-- and we talk about it, but it's something I have a lot of pride in-- is the team that I'm able to build and the team that is willing to come and work with me is really important. And it's a diverse team. It's diverse thought. One of the things that I've really spent a lot of time on is, how do I hire people that are better, smarter, wiser than me?

Because the exciting thing about being part of a team is them telling you ideas and pushing you. And it's also exciting for me, because we all want to be learning animals. We want to continuously improve. And putting yourself and surrounding yourself with people that push you to do that, it's very contagious. And it feeds off each other. And so that would be one of the biggest things, I would say.

ANDY SERWER: And you worked, what, on Wall Street, and went to business school at the same time, and had to pay for the school, and all of that, right?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Well, so, again, I was putting myself through college. And so I was able to get a job on Wall Street. I actually went to NYU's undergrad business school because it was in New York. And so I knew it would allow me to have internships. And I had jobs that I didn't have a degree-- and really leverage those skills instead of that experience top track that we talked about.

But I was able to find the minimum wage jobs-- sometimes it was a few of them-- to help pay for school. And it gave me such a different experience that I was able to get access to all these different jobs before graduating and working all these different roles. And not only that, but it allowed me also to pay for school, which is always nice when you definitely need to finance your own education.

ANDY SERWER: What advice do you have for others, maybe especially young women, who want to achieve that same level of professional success?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: The number one thing I would say is believing in yourself. Especially coming through finance and moving into operations, it's really important that sometimes you might be the only one at the table that is your first of your kind-- whatever it is, a woman, whether you are a man at the table with all women, whether you're a Black American, white American, Hispanic-- but it's really being focused on believing in yourself and not really taking, no, for an answer.

One of the things I always talk about at CareerBuilder is you're either asking the wrong person, or you're asking the wrong question. And so how do you really push through that? And sometimes it's a lot easier to listen to the negative sayers or to the negative perspectives out there than to really continue to believe and push forward. And hard work-- a lot of it is hard work. It's continuing to stay at it-- you know more than anybody, Andy. And a little luck doesn't help-- doesn't hurt.

ANDY SERWER: All right, let me ask you the most important question of this interview, which is, how did you get your job at CareerBuilder?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Well, it's interesting. I happened to get a phone call from Apollo that owns CareerBuilder and the board of CareerBuilder. And they were looking for somebody that would really believe in the mission, which is about empowering employment. And they wanted somebody to help really capitalize on the growth opportunities that were there for the business.

And it's a 25-year-old brand that is pretty well-known and one of the leaders in the employment space. And they wanted to bring somebody in that had passion for employment and for what could be really realized with CareerBuilder. And, Andy, you asked about my immigrant experience, and those two really overlapped for me. To go through really that kind of childhood that I went through, I have just such an appreciation on how employment can be really a great equalizer on so many different levels.

And having an ability to influence that in some way is just something that's really exciting for me. And the team it's-- where our mission-driven values come from, it's why we come every day to work to see how we can help have a little bit of an impact on the world we're in.

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you a little bit more about CareerBuilder-- what's the business model? How does it make money?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Yes. So we are a two-sided marketplace. So we are one of the largest job advertising sites. We have over 160 million candidate profiles. So for candidates, it's absolutely free. They come and look for different job openings, they post their resume, and then on the employer side, we work with the majority of the Fortune 500, most of the small and medium-sized businesses-- again, we're one of the largest. And they essentially pay us to advertise their jobs to those 160 million candidates that we have. So it's essentially a matching service for jobs.

ANDY SERWER: What are mistakes or maybe the biggest mistake that applicants make?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Not really reviewing what they're posting. Grammar-- there is a lot of mistakes on grammar. Not highlighting their skill set is a second one. A lot of people spend a lot of time on their experience, but they don't pull out what is it that they did at their experience. And then really what they're looking for as well-- again, highlighting their skill set.

But the employers make a lot of mistakes as well. One of the things that we've seen is the biggest employer mistakes is the job description-- is whether it's written biased, or it's not as inclusive as it can be. And it's actually the biggest reason, Andy, that candidates don't click on a job or don't want to apply for a job is based on the job description.

ANDY SERWER: And similar kind of question-- what's your top advice for people applying for jobs during the pandemic?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Make yourself as available as possible. So make sure that you are where recruiters are looking, that you are on the top job sites, that you are attending virtual networking events, that you're attending virtual hiring events. And sometimes that means that you might get a few rejections, but you're going into their queue, you're going into their pipeline.

And one of the things that we do with all of our clients is we re-engage past candidates. The majority of our matches are based on our recommendation engine, which reengages candidates. So making sure that you're out there and in front-- and also, again, highlighting the skill set. And we talked about this a little bit, but the economy is changing, roles are changing.

Postal meter readers used to be one of the biggest roles out there, and that doesn't exist anymore. And so how do you pivot that if you're in a role that no longer has a lot of demand, how do you make sure that you are considered for your skill set into other industries?

ANDY SERWER: And final question, Irina-- you have many more years ahead of you in your career. So I'm going to ask you one of those, again, job interview questions-- where do you see yourself in 10, 15, 20 years? What do you hope to accomplish?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Andy, I will tell you that one of the things that has made me successful and has allowed me to do what I do is I really focus on the present and the now. And it's hard to think too far out. I think one of the important things for me in the role that I do is I really wanted to be part of helping to build American culture. And I feel so grateful to be in this country and have had the opportunities that I do-- that in every role that I'm in, I really try to see if I can leave some sort of mark on what has made this country great.

And so it's not a great, clear answer for you, Andy. But it's how do I stay focused on what I'm doing? And it's helping employ America, and helping get that American re-hire going, and making sure that I'm getting and giving the best to my employees, and leaving a little bit of a mark on a country that's left a huge, huge mark on me.

ANDY SERWER: No, I think it's a great, clear answer-- I have to disagree with you. A great answer.

[LAUGHTER]

Thank you so much, Irina Novoselsky. Thank you very much for your time.

227,2021-02-03T22:28:23+00:00,EBay Projects Revenue That Tops Estimates on Customer Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc. gave revenue and profit forecasts for the current period that topped analysts’ estimates, suggesting the company is gaining new customers amid an e-commerce boom. Shares jumped about 10% in extended trading.

Sales will be $2.94 billion to $2.99 billion in the first quarter, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Earnings, excluding some items, will be $1.03 to $1.08 a share. Analysts estimated profit of 85 cents a share on sales of $2.54 billion.

Pandemic-wary shoppers have turned to online marketplaces like EBay and Amazon.com Inc. to avoid stores in the era of social distancing. EBay said it ended the quarter with 185 million active buyers, an increase of 7%.

“EBay is proving that it has the ability to sustain the gains it is seeing from Covid,” said Ygal Arounian, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “We expect these trends to increasingly become ingrained in consumer behavior, which will support EBay in 2021.”

The e-commerce company has been divesting pieces under pressure from activist investors. Last year, it sold event-tickets marketplace StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion and its classifieds business to Norway’s Adevinta ASA in a cash-and-stock deal worth $9.2 billion that leaves EBay with a 44.4% stake in the company. It is exploring the sale of the company’s online marketplace in Korea where EBay gets more than 10% of its revenue.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone, who took the helm in April, is still trying to show that a slimmed-down EBay can lure customers and get them to spend more on the site.

Revenue jumped 28% to $2.89 billion in the period ended Dec. 31, beating analysts’ average projection of $2.7 billion. Profit, excluding some items, was 86 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 82 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Gross merchandise volume, the value of all goods sold on the site, rose 21% in the holiday quarter to 26.6 billion, down from a 22% year-over-year increase in the third quarter.

Shares rose to a high of $64.86 in extended trading after closing at $58.04. the stock has increased almost 70% in the past 12 months.

229,2021-02-03T20:37:56+00:00,Here’s what Bezos’ stepping down from Amazon could mean for ETFs,"Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous and Cinthia Murphy, Managing Editor of ETF.com, discuss how Bezos’ stepping down from Amazon could impact ETFs.

Video Transcript

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Amazon is a big driver of performance across several Exchange Traded Funds. There are at least six ETFs where Amazon represents 20% or more of the entire portfolio. So what did the change at the top of Amazon, or that announcement, at least, mean for those ETFs? Joining me now is Cinthia Murphy. She's managing editor of ETF.com. Cinthia, good to see you. So let's start with the impact you have seen thus far. It doesn't look like the stock has moved in any big way in either direction after this news.

CINTHIA MURPHY: Hi, Alexis. Yeah, absolutely. It's been a very muted reaction. I think the market was expecting a really good earnings report, which they got. And Jeff Bezos's announcement yesterday, I was a little surprised actually how little reaction it got, but maybe that's a positive sign for the company. Maybe people think Amazon is kind of a self-driving vehicle already. It doesn't really matter who's at the top. It just keeps on growing. So there wasn't as much volatility as you might have expected.

But, you know, the lesson here from an ETF perspective is that, you know, like you mentioned, at least six ETFs, Amazon is at least 20% of the portfolio. So you buy an ETF to be broadly diversified across a segment or across a part of the market. And then you have one single stock in that mix that carries 20% to 25% of the whole portfolio, meaning any action in Amazon could really drive the performance of these funds.

Now, luckily, this time around, there wasn't much of a movement in the stock. But you have to know what your portfolio consists of and how much single stock risk is in that mix. If you think of, overall, there's almost 300 ETFs that own Amazon stock-- I was just doing some math before the show today-- that's almost more than $100 billion worth of Amazon market cap today is tied to ETF portfolios. So it's not a negligible amount. It's a huge amount. So any news on Amazon definitely has a direct impact on several ETFs.

Story continues

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: All right, always good advice, though, right, just to see inside your ETF, what is it that's there. Because I think a lot of folks think, oh, it's just this basket of stocks, and I'm well diversified. But within that basket, you might not be well diversified, as we see those six ETFs there with 20% or more making up-- of Amazon making up the whole portfolio. So what should investors be looking for when they're out there looking for an ETF? What are sort of some check-- check off some boxes for us in terms of what it is they should be looking for.

CINTHIA MURPHY: Yeah, to use the Amazon as an example, you find Amazon mostly in consumer discretionary ETFs. So if you start with your-- you know, the biggest, which is the Select Sector SPDR, XLY is the ticker. It's a market cap weighted portfolio. It carries the same stocks and the same weighting as there in the S&P 500 within that segment. So if Amazon is almost 25% consumer discretionary, it's going to be that allocation's portfolio. It doesn't make any adjustments for that kind of concentration.

Now if you're not comfortable with that, if you want to go away from just your pure beta market exposure, then you might want to consider like an equal weighted ETF that just tilts more heavily towards some of the smaller names, take some of the weight out of the big ones, so you are more purely diversified across then. You might want something that puts other screens, like different fundamental screens. So the offering is huge. There's no really one solution for every investor. It really has to be how comfortable you are with a single stock risk, with the drivers of the portfolio.

But, again, like you said, you can never assume that you are totally well diversified and safe. Because on a market cap weighted ETF, which most are, you are just going to get some of these concentrations as these companies grow.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Cinthia, what about the other big theme we saw this week? And that's that big run up we saw in silver as, again, investors on these online forums decided to push it up in the hopes of hurting those who were shorting silver. How did that impact ETFs that have a lot of exposure to the metal?

CINTHIA MURPHY: So silver has been an interesting case because, you know, if you really want to invest in silver, you either have to buy a mining company, which is not really a pure exposure to silver, or you've got to go through the futures market, which is not as easily to access as anybody out there with a brokerage account. So ETFs tend to be a very-- a big-time used vehicle for access because you're buying a silver ETF that actually has silver bullion vaulted in London somewhere. But you're buying like you're buying any stock through an exchange, so it's very widely used.

The biggest silver ETF, the ticker SLV from iShares, it's picked up in 2021 alone more than $3.3 billion in net inflows. So even though the short squeeze may have fizzled out, it didn't really work. It was clearly a vehicle of choice for people trying to buy this upward momentum. Because for every ounce of-- every share you buy of that ETF, they have to have that ounce stored away in a vault somewhere. So you have-- it's a direct correlation to the silver price and the ETF share price.

And the amount of volume in these ETFs has been huge this year. They already came from a record last year. And this year is just taking on another life of its own. So it's kind of an easy access point. If you want to play these commodities through your brokerage account, ETFs are the tickers, so it's easy to go.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: And what about just overall interest in ETFs? What have the inflows been looking like now as we're here in the second month of the new year?

CINTHIA MURPHY: You know, for January, we are already ahead of the pace we saw in 2020, which was a record pace. So January versus January of last year, we've already beaten that number. A lot of the flows have gone into equity ETFs, especially international equity ETFs. So there's a lot of value hunting in some of these more of the emerging markets and some of the European markets.

But demand is strong. Traders are out there. Long-term investors are out there. And the ETF demand just keeps on rising. We're already at a new record pace for 2021 one month in. So it's looking good.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Off to the races we go. Cinthia Murphy, managing editor of ETF.com, good to see you.

231,2021-02-03T15:05:08+00:00,UPS CEO Calls Sale Of UPS Freight To TFI A 'Win-Win',"UPS Inc.'s (NYSE: UPS) sale of its less-than-truckload business, UPS Freight, to Canadian firm TFI International Inc. (NYSE: TFII) works out well for both parties as it relieves UPS of a noncore, low-margin asset and puts the business in the hands of a more freight-centric carrier, UPS CEO Carol Tomé said Tuesday.

The $800 million all-cash deal, which was announced last week, is expected to close at the start of the second quarter, Tomé (pictured) told analysts on a conference call Tuesday to discuss UPS' fourth-quarter and full-year results. UPS will use the proceeds to pay down debt, she said. Montreal-based TFI will rebrand the unit as TForce Freight. UPS will sell the new TFI service for no less than five years and will provide back-office services for three years. All 14,500 UPS Freight employees, including 11,500 Teamsters union members, will join TFI.

Tomé said she made the disposal of UPS Freight a top priority as soon as she started the job on June 1. Tomé, who was named to UPS' board in 2003, watched as UPS acquired Overnite Transportation Co., the forerunner of UPS Freight, two years later for the then-lofty price of $1.25 billion, only to take an impairment charge shortly after the acquisition was completed.

""It's never turned out to be what we thought it would be,"" she said, referring to UPS Freight. ""It's a capital-intensive, low-margin business that we don't need to own"" to make money by offering an LTL solution to shippers, she said.

Tomé said that UPS Freight employees should also be happy to join a company that's more aligned with their interests than was UPS, a parcel-delivery-focused concern that positioned UPS Freight as a loss leader by offering cut-rate prices in exchange for more small-package business.

""We couldn't be happier"" with the way the transaction turned out, Tomé said.

Her remarks came as the Atlanta-based package giant reported one of its most impressive quarters in years. The nation's largest transportation company also reported all-time annual records for revenue at $84.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $8.23. After adjustments and dilution, UPS posted a fourth-quarter gain of $2.66 a share, way above estimates that ranged between $2.10 and $2.20 a share. The adjusted EPS figures were 55 cents higher than the adjusted 2019 results, equating to a 26.1% year-on-year gain, Atlanta-based UPS said.

Story continues

On an adjusted basis, operating income rose 26% to $2.2 billion, the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's 114-year history.

The 2020 adjustments included a $4.9 billion noncash charge for pension-related changes; a $545 million after-tax impairment change for selling UPS Freight; and a $114 million after-tax charge for UPS' ongoing multiyear project to reengineer its massive distribution network to handle more business-to-consumer (B2C) traffic resulting from online orders.

Fourth-quarter 2020 revenue rose 21% to $24.9 billion. The domestic package division was the upside standout, with domestic revenue up a surprising 17.7%, and operating margins up 8.8%, also higher than analysts had expected. U.S. domestic revenue per piece rose 7.8%, the highest growth rate in more than 10 years. Ground revenue per piece increased by 11.2%.

In what Tomé referred to as a ""turning point"" for the company's finances, domestic package revenue grew faster than average daily volume during the fourth quarter, a pattern she said will continue into 2021. This bodes well for pricing and margin strength, she said.

UPS clearly benefited in the fourth quarter by a massive spike in peak-season online ordering, which by the end of the year had accounted for more than 20% of all U.S. retail sales. Tomé does not see much of a leveling off in 2021 because a broader swath of the U.S. population has become comfortable with and accustomed to e-commerce. This will continue to put pressure on capacity and push UPS to further optimize its network, she said. As a result, UPS will likely emphasize the higher-margin SMB segment and focus less on the big, high-volume customers that have long enjoyed favorable pricing conditions.

This may include Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which accounted for 13.3% of UPS' 2020 revenues in 2020 and remains its largest single customer.

UPS shares closed the day Tuesday up more than 2.5% at $160.29 a share.

The Seattle-based e-commerce company plans to expand the program to 15 more cities this year, it said in a blog post. Amazon, which is backing Rivian along with Ford Motor Co., is buying 100,000 electric vans that are custom-built for Amazon Prime. The first vehicles were due to start making deliveries this year.

Rivian recently raised $2.65 billion in new funding from a group of investors led by T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and is one of a number of startups trying to bring new electric vehicles to market and take on incumbent Tesla Inc., whose shares skyrocketed last year. Rivian plans to build a full-size battery-powered sport-utility vehicle and truck at a plant in Normal, Illinois, a retooled former Mitsubishi Motors Corp. factory.

An Indian court blocked Future Group's sale of a swathe of assets to rival Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the deal, in a battle of the retail titans that could reshape the shopping sector.

The appeal against that order is set to be filed later on Wednesday in the court, the source said, declining to be identified.

238,2021-02-03T03:48:35+00:00,Reliance’s $3.4 Billion Deal With Future Group Temporarily Halted,"(Bloomberg) -- Future Retail Ltd.’s dollar bonds plunged on an Indian court temporarily restraining parent Future Group from selling its retail assets to Reliance Industries Ltd., after Future’s partner Amazon.com Inc. had sought the suspension.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday ordered the Future Group and Indian authorities to ensure the status of the indebted Indian retailer’s assets are maintained as is, putting on hold any further steps toward completing the $3.4 billion sale to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance conglomerate. Future Retail’s dollar bond due January 2025 tumbled 7.4 cents to 78.8 cents on Wednesday, the sharpest drop in three months.

Amazon, which is opposing the deal with an eye to dominating a large and vital consumer market, alleges that the plan violates its own contract with Future Group. It had filed an urgent petition last week seeking the suspension. The order can be challenged in a higher court.

The freeze bolsters the Jeff Bezos-led e-commerce giant, which had also urged the court to jail Future Group’s founder and seize its assets for violating an October order from the Singapore arbitration court. The cash-strapped Indian retailer -- it risks bankruptcy if the deal with Reliance fails -- is caught between two of the world’s richest men as they compete for dominance in India’s estimated $1 trillion consumer retail market.

The Indian court said it was of the prima facie view that the Singapore tribunal order, which asked Future Retail to not proceed with the deal, is enforceable in India.

Future Retail will “explore all legal remedies and take appropriate steps to pursue the scheme of arrangement,” it said in a stock exchange filing late Tuesday. Amazon appreciates the court’s order, it said in an emailed statement.

Advantage Amazon

The stakes are high. For Amazon, which has struggled to gain traction in China where local giants dominate the e-commerce sector, India with a population of 1.3 billion is the only other market of similar size that can boost the company’s growth. Blocking Reliance, which is already the country’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, is key. Acquiring Future’s assets will double Reliance’s retail footprint -- an advantage Amazon is not willing to cede.

Story continues

The Indian retailer’s lawyer Darius Khambata told the court that Future Group wasn’t willing to hold talks with Amazon to explore an amicable out-of-court settlement. Khambata said Future does not want to complicate matters as it has sought regulatory approvals for the asset sale deal. Amazon’s lawyer said the e-tailer was willing to talk, without giving up its rights in the case.

“The Singapore arbitration decision places Future Group in an unenviable position with no immediate resolution in sight,” said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director at consultancy Bexley Advisors. A probable option now is bankruptcy court “where residual value could be unlocked, which in Future Group’s case would be significant. The key question is who that value accrues to,” he said.

Wilful Disobedience

Amazon, in its recent petition, alleged that Future had displayed deliberate and willful disobedience of the overseas arbitration court’s order. The e-tailer owns a minority stake in one of Future Group’s firms and has accused the latter of violating a contract when it agreed to the deal with Reliance.

The legal victory for Amazon comes after its letters to Indian regulators seeking to stop approvals for the deal were unsuccessful. The antitrust regulator gave its approval in November. The stock exchanges earlier this month reported no adverse observations.

Future Retail Ltd., the group’s flagship firm, missed a Jan. 22 deadline to make an interest payment on its dollar bond and proposed to meet the obligation in a month. The court order threatens its ability to repay.

240,2021-02-02T22:20:43+00:00,Google Cloud Reports Huge Operating Losses in New Disclosure,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. said its Google Cloud business had an operating loss of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a new disclosure that may disappoint some Wall Street analysts.

The Mountain View, California-based company revealed the number on Tuesday in a statement. For 2020, the cloud division lost $5.6 billion, Alphabet said.

“An important element of our operating loss is that we have been building out our organization ahead of revenue, and that includes our product portfolio, the network of data centers,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. This will help the company pursue this large market opportunity, she added.

Google Cloud revenue climbed 47% to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter, matching analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Brian Fitzgerald, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., was looking for Google Cloud to generate an operating margin of less than 20% in the fourth quarter, or roughly $750 million in profit on revenue of $3.75 billion.

Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak expected Google Cloud to make about $3 billion last year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Read the Preview: Alphabet Results to Reveal New Data Wall Street Wants to See

The results are way behind Amazon.com Inc., which runs Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider. That business generated fourth-quarter operating income of $3.56 billion on revenue of $12.7 billion.

Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian is trying to catch Amazon and Microsoft Corp. He has spent rapidly to expand the cloud sales force and the company has continued investing in new data centers.

Some analysts expect profitability to emerge as the division matures. Morgan Stanley’s Nowak sees Google Cloud’s EBITDA reaching $13 billion by 2024 on revenue of $35 billion.

242,2021-02-02T17:33:23+00:00,Rocket Maker Astra to Go Public Through Merger With a SPAC,"(Bloomberg) -- The next chapter of “SPACs in Space” has been written.

Astra, a maker of small rockets used to send satellites into orbit, plans to reveal Tuesday an agreement to go public by merging with Holicity Inc., a special purpose acquisition company run by telecommunications legend and billionaire Craig McCaw. The deal will value Astra at $2.1 billion and let the company tap into $300 million raised by Holicity, along with another $200 million from funds managed by BlackRock Inc.

If the deal closes as expected in the second quarter, Astra will trade under the ticker symbol ASTR on the Nasdaq exchange, the companies said. The news sent Holicity’s shares surging as much as 51% on Tuesday.

Founded in 2016 by Chris Kemp and Adam London, Astra has been manufacturing a line of small, relatively cheap rockets at its factory in Alameda, California. The company quickly built its first test rockets but later ran into problems with its initial launch attempts—some of which ended in fiery explosions.

In December, Astra’s Rocket 3.2 had a successful launch from a spaceport in Alaska where the machine performed well for several minutes but narrowly missed reaching its target orbit in space. According to Kemp, Astra’s chief executive officer, some minor tweaks should solve the issue and allow Astra to fly again this summer. The goal is to begin monthly rocket launches through the latter half of the year. “We have demonstrated our ability to reach orbit, and now it’s about putting capital into the business to build out our factory and bring in some of the best talent,” Kemp said.

In the private space arena, Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is the dominant maker of large rockets designed to carry thousands of pounds of satellites into orbit at a cost of roughly $60 million per launch. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab, which was founded in New Zealand by Peter Beck, has been the only small rocket maker to fly regular missions at about $10 million to $13 million per launch. Its Electron rocket can carry hundreds of pounds of satellites for commercial and government customers. Astra’s rocket will be capable of carrying less cargo than Rocket Lab’s, although it will only charge $3 million per launch.

Story continues

The first—and last—significant rocket maker to go public was Orbital Sciences in 1990. SpaceX and Rocket Lab remain private. On the space tourism side of things, Virgin Galactic went public via a SPAC arrangement in 2019. Richard Branson’s aerospace company has been performing tests with its space plane designed to carry people up about 55 miles where they can briefly experience weightlessness.

All of these companies are part of a frenzied, global competition to reduce the cost of putting people and objects into orbit, while outflanking governments and government contractors that have long done this type of work. Companies like Astra are betting that the commercial space revolution has just begun and that there will soon be demand for daily rocket launches as startups and larger companies look to fill the skies with communications, imaging and scientific instruments.

“Since Day One, we have been focused on building a company that can completely open up access to space,” Kemp said. “We want to help launch this whole new generation of companies that are observing and connecting and improving life on Earth.”

For McCaw, the deal is a return to a business the telecom mogul tried to crack decades ago. Going back to the early 1990s, McCaw took a number of stabs at trying to lower the cost of building satellites and getting them into the space. He hoped to build a type of space-based communications and internet system similar to what SpaceX, OneWeb, Amazon.com Inc. and others are in the process of building now. According to McCaw, the traditional rocket makers and aerospace players made the costs of the underlying technology too expensive for his earlier ventures to succeed.

“The whole system was just wrong,” McCaw said. “They expected people to use crummy stuff and take on severe risk. The insurance costs alone were equivalent to about 30 of Astra’s rocket launches. We are coming back to launch because it’s the item of greatest frustration where the most change has yet to occur.” Bill Gates, a longtime business partner of McCaw, is also a backer of Holicity.

With so many companies reaching for the same territory above our heads, Astra will have to learn quickly how to turn the traditionally low-profit rocket launch business into a successful long-term venture while also outpacing competitors, McCaw said. Virgin Orbit, a private Branson venture separate from Virgin Galactic, recently reached orbit with its rocket, and other companies are expected to follow in the next couple of years. “The challenge of a business like this is making sure you don’t fall into becoming a commodity,” McCaw said. “You can see that there will have to be a shakeout in the launch business. The question is, Who gets there, and who doesn’t? That’s the critical test for Astra.”

As part of a push toward profitability, Astra plans to begin building the core elements of satellites into its rockets. This would allow satellite and scientific startups to avoid much of the grunt work. Meanwhile, Astra would be able to charge for satellite services. Rocket Lab has already moved in this same direction. “We will have a spacecraft that clicks into our rocket,” Kemp said. “This will allow customers to focus on their camera or their software or the unique radio they want to fly. We are trying to build a platform that has launch as its foundation.”

The need for social distancing remains generally positive for the ecommerce segment, which includes pureplays as well as traditional retailers with ecommerce capabilities. However, estimates from the Commerce Department indicate that some of the traffic that moved online during the initial months of the pandemic is moving back to stores-

Accordingly, ecommerce sales in the last quarter were 36.7% above 3Q19 (down 1% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 7.0% (up 12.0% sequentially). Ecommerce accounted for over 14.3% of total U.S. retail sales (it was 20%+ in the second quarter).

Despite these stats, there's evidence that the race to digitization is accelerating, consumer habits are altering for good and supply chains are adjusting to help the two sides meet.

Given the very strong growth in 2020, we could expect flat to slightly down earnings this year because of more difficult comps. Certain names that still stand out are JD.com, ASOS plc, Jumia Tech, Monotaro and Overstock.com.

About the Industry

Electronic-commerce, the method of buying and selling goods and services via a software platform, continues to evolve as the technologies driving it get more advanced.

On the one side are user devices, which are getting bigger, brighter and more capable. Voice-controlled devices like smartwatches and smart home devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod are joining these to facilitate conversational commerce.

On the other side are the software platforms facilitating the transaction, which are getting AI-enabled, sometimes including AR/VR and getting generally more sophisticated, and therefore, more capable of delivering a satisfying user experience. Social commerce is developing into a major trend as are chatbots that facilitate back-end operations and customer care.

Story continues

Differentiation in the industry comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty and so forth, which generally tip the scale in favor of larger players. Particularly because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting, which keeps prices down.

A peculiarity of the market is Amazon's complete dominance in the U.S. and its growing presence in other important markets. This is driving some traditional players to partner with Amazon. Chinese companies Alibaba and JD.com are other significant players.

Factors Shaping the Future of the Internet-Commerce industry:

The pandemic has proved extremely beneficial for ecommerce players, and not just because of the government-mandated stay-home orders that led to soaring business volumes. Markets have been open across the country for a couple of quarters now, but purchasing trends haven't gone back to where they were before. Just like many companies temporarily adopting work-from-home practices are expected to make it a broader trend, many shoppers are also likely to keep away from stores, at least until a broader vaccination of the population. One thing this trend should boost (if technology companies are up to it) is the adoption of AR/VR technology because of its potential to greatly enhance showcasing. The technology is already being leveraged very effectively in the housing market. Also, the ability to fit things like furniture or other items where people want it in their homes is better even than physical retail. More stores will likely be converted into delivery hubs to facilitate this trend. As American companies like Amazon and Walmart continue their march to conquer the world, it's relevant for this outlook to include data that goes beyond the borders. So, according to eMarketer's projections, global retail ecommerce is expected to decelerate from 27.6% growth in 2020 to 14.3% growth in 2021 even as total retail sales go from down 3.0% to up 5.1%. The U.S. piece of ecommerce is expected to go from 32.4% growth last year to 6.1% this year while total retail improves from a decline of 3.2% to an increase of 1.6%. The categories experiencing strongest ecommerce growth in 2020 include consumer electronics; furniture and home furnishings; health, personal care & beauty; and food and beverages.  The categories experiencing weakness include all kinds of traditional retail; auto, which however picked up quite strongly in the second half; all kinds of online booking for public travel and hospitality, hitting companies like Expedia and TripAdvisor; and apparel, which was however stronger than initially expected. This year, traditional retailers will double down on digital initiatives including click and collect, cashierless checkout, contactless payment and digital signage while online retailers focus on social commerce, grocery sales and the buy-now-pay-later option. Both ecommerce pureplays and traditional retailers branching into ecommerce are seeing a surge in ecommerce sales. However, physical presence remains important because it is only proximity to a consumer that can facilitate quick delivery. So the trend moving retailers toward a hybrid/omnichannel model that customers can get quick delivery from, or from where they can pick up the items ordered online (BOPIS, curbside pickup), at their convenience, and through apps arranging personal shoppers, is likely to remain. Self-driven delivery vehicles and drones are already on the horizon to deal with logistics problems and make deliveries smoother and cheaper.  Also, data mining has never been easier. Because of the many details involved in satisfying a customer, data mining has grown in importance over the years, with the party controlling the customer's data being best positioned to identify and service demand while also delivering the desired experience. Most of the big ecommerce players are also into payments processing, which gives them further insight into a customer's tastes, preferences and buying habits. As machines read and process this data, they can create programs and processes to maximize customer satisfaction and drive sales. Artificial intelligence such as that used by companies like Amazon already decides how competitive a player is. But in the not-too-distant future, more and more retailers will jump on board and harnessing big data will become imperative for survival.

All said, revenue growth rates may be expected to remain very strong as a result of more companies moving online and existing players utilizing more advanced tools and analytics to increase their return on investment. But profitability could come in for some pressure (for some) as companies invest heavily in building out infrastructure to support the strong revenue growth and also comply with safety guidelines. Experiential retail is also likely to be an important area of investment for retailers.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects The Strong Prospects

The Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #199, which places it at the bottom 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects.

The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of its relative performance versus others. As far as aggregate estimate revisions are concerned, it appears that analysts expect earnings to decline this year and the next on revenue that will be down slightly this year but grow strongly in the next.

The net decline in the 2021 and 2022 earnings estimates are 30.5% and 23.0%. The net decline in the revenue estimate for 2021 is 1.0% and the net increase for 2022 is 7.1%. The delta is likely attributable to increased cost of operation and amortization and other charges related to infrastructure buildup.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Leads On Shareholder Returns

The Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry is trading at a premium to both the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.

So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 42.7% over the past year, compared to the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector's 33.6% and the Zacks S&P 500 Composite's 15.9%.

Industry's Current Valuation

On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which is a more appropriate valuation criterion in the current situation, we see that the industry is currently trading at a 4.53X multiple, higher than the S&P 500's 4.49X and understandably higher than the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.32X.

Over the past year, the industry has traded as high as 5.69X, as low as 4.00X and at the median of 4.82X.

3 Stocks Standing Out

JD.com: Through its website www.jd.com and mobile applications, JD offers a broad selection of products to customers in China. The company is the second largest ecommerce company in China after Alibaba.

JD's leadership in the fragmented and fast-growing Chinese ecommerce market, the breadth of its products and particular strength in electronics, continued innovation and ability to cater to strong demand following the pandemic are expected to generate very strong results in the foreseeable future.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up a penny in the last 30 days.

The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is up 126.2% over the past year.

ASOS: This is a British provider of fashion goods including womenswear and menswear, footwear, accessories, jewelry and beauty and grooming products that are sold through its website, asos.com. It operates in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, the U.S., Russia and China.

The company has recently picked up the famous Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge brands from Arcadia, which went out of business. ASOS has also seen the same pandemic-driven surge in its results that other ecommerce players in the U.S. have seen. While the company is well positioned for growth this year, it primarily caters to young adults in their twenties, and there is some pandemic-driven unemployment risk in this group.

This Zacks Rank #2 company's current year EPS estimate up 16.1% in the last 30 days.

Its shares are up 50.8% over the past year.

Jumia Technologies: Jumia is a German online retailer of dresses, leggings, skirts, polo shirts, belts, watches, sunglasses, health products, beauty products and a range of products for children, among other things to a number of countries in Africa.

The main positive for this company is its first-mover advantage in Africa, where there are a number of emerging economies. However, infrastructure isn't the same as it is in the U.S. or Western Europe, so there are also challenges to its becoming the ""Amazon of Africa"" as it has often been referred to. The pandemic hasn't moved the needle for Jumia in 2020, but this year could be different since there has been a resurgence in important markets like South Africa and Nigeria.

The company is yet to turn in a profit, but its per share loss for 2021 is down 1 cents in the last 60 days. It's also down 38 cents from the estimated loss for 2020.

The shares are up 920.4% from last year and a short squeeze could be brewing.

Legal Marijuana: An Investor's Dream

Imagine getting in early on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027.

Although marijuana stocks did better as the pandemic took hold than the market as a whole, they've been pushed down. This is exactly the right time to get in on selected strong companies at a fraction of their value before COVID struck. Zacks' Special Report, Marijuana Moneymakers, reveals 10 exciting tickers for urgent consideration.

245,2021-02-01T09:44:45+00:00,InPost Inks Amazon Deal to Tighten Grip on Polish E-Commerce,"(Bloomberg) -- Parcel locker company InPost SA has clinched a five-year deal with Amazon Inc. as the U.S. giant enters Poland’s revved up $19 billion e-commerce market.

Fresh from last week’s successful initial public offering, InPost Chief Executive Officer Rafal Brzoska revealed the contract in an interview with Bloomberg. The Amsterdam-listed company will handle some Amazon deliveries in Poland through its network of automated lockers as well as directly to homes, he said.

The deal, which doesn’t cover shipments abroad, will help maintain InPost’s revenues if Amazon eats into the dominant position of Allegro.eu SA, the east European country’s e-commerce leader and the biggest client for its parcel lockers. The Polish company is boosting capacity to accommodate what it expects to be a gradual ramp-up of operations by the U.S. giant.

“We expect our friends from Amazon to pace their entry -- this is not going to be a Blitzkrieg,” Brzoska, 43, said by phone. Amazon’s step is “very positive, because it means increased volumes. For the entire market, it means faster e-commerce penetration.”

InPost shares gained as much as 3.1% and traded 1% higher at 10:42 a.m. in Amsterdam, while Allegro dropped 5.1% in Warsaw before recouping most losses. The Amazon-InPost deal shows that the U.S. giant has “serious plans” for Poland, and making use of a delivery method often preferred by Poles may help it grow, Erste Group Bank AG’s analyst Konrad Grygo said.

Lifestyle Change

Amazon last week invited sellers to start registering for its new Polish website that will go live soon. The move coincided with InPost’s market debut via a 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) IPO which turned Brzoska into a billionaire. The company jumped 24% since its listing and is worth 9.9 billion euros.

InPost, which has more than 10,000 lockers, plans to add 4,000 to 5,000 more this year, predicting market growth after better-than-expected volumes in the fourth quarter. The company isn’t changing its mid-term capex plan of as much as 625 million zloty ($168 million) per year after Amazon’s decision, the CEO said.

Story continues

Brzoska is betting that Poles’ embrace of online shopping is a lifestyle change that will outlast the pandemic and that the eventual lifting of virus-related restrictions won’t be a big hit for InPost’s business model.

InPost shrugs off competition risk from companies that seek to encroach on its home turf, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s AliExpress, Poland’s post office and state-run refiner and retailer PKN Orlen SA. Even as these companies may install as many as 5,000 lockers in Poland over next few years, they would still lack the technology to undermine InPost’s position, he said.

Tech Tandem

While clinching the Amazon agreement, whose business or financial details haven’t been published, Brzoska remains confident about InPost’s relationship with Allegro.eu.

The two companies signed a seven-year delivery deal in September, even as Polish marketplace plans to launch its own machines. Brzoska wants to see such step as diversification only. About 70% of Allegro’s merchandise go through InPost lockers.

“We created a tandem that has generated the biggest tech IPOs in Europe,” he said. “We achieved so much together already and I believe we can achieve even more.”

Erste’s Grygo said he expects the entry of Amazon to potentially push Allegro toward foreign expansion so it can maintain its rapid growth.

Brzoska is also looking to expand in western Europe. InPost wants to double its U.K. network of automated lockers to 2,000 machines this year. In France, where about 40% of all online purchases are delivered through the out-of-home model, it will seek to buy logistic companies running pick-up and delivery chains in early 2021.

He said the pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the western European model based on pick-up and drop-off points located in convenience stores or in cafés, which became overwhelmed during peak shopping seasons. That creates a lifetime opportunity for InPost.

“Merchants in Western Europe have reached their limits,” Brzoska said. “Pick-up points can serve about 20-40 parcels a day while our lockers even 700. Polish merchants have learned their lesson, now it’s time for Western Europe.”

246,2021-02-01T09:44:45+00:00,InPost Inks Amazon Deal to Tighten Grip on Polish E-Commerce,"(Bloomberg) -- Parcel locker company InPost SA has clinched a five-year deal with Amazon Inc. as the U.S. giant enters Poland’s revved up $19 billion e-commerce market.

Fresh from last week’s successful initial public offering, InPost Chief Executive Officer Rafal Brzoska revealed the contract in an interview with Bloomberg. The Amsterdam-listed company will handle some Amazon deliveries in Poland through its network of automated lockers as well as directly to homes, he said.

The deal, which doesn’t cover shipments abroad, will help maintain InPost’s revenues if Amazon eats into the dominant position of Allegro.eu SA, the east European country’s e-commerce leader and the biggest client for its parcel lockers. The Polish company is boosting capacity to accommodate what it expects to be a gradual ramp-up of operations by the U.S. giant.

“We expect our friends from Amazon to pace their entry -- this is not going to be a Blitzkrieg,” Brzoska, 43, said by phone. Amazon’s step is “very positive, because it means increased volumes. For the entire market, it means faster e-commerce penetration.”

InPost shares gained as much as 3.1% and traded 1% higher at 10:42 a.m. in Amsterdam, while Allegro dropped 5.1% in Warsaw before recouping most losses. The Amazon-InPost deal shows that the U.S. giant has “serious plans” for Poland, and making use of a delivery method often preferred by Poles may help it grow, Erste Group Bank AG’s analyst Konrad Grygo said.

Lifestyle Change

Amazon last week invited sellers to start registering for its new Polish website that will go live soon. The move coincided with InPost’s market debut via a 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) IPO which turned Brzoska into a billionaire. The company jumped 24% since its listing and is worth 9.9 billion euros.

InPost, which has more than 10,000 lockers, plans to add 4,000 to 5,000 more this year, predicting market growth after better-than-expected volumes in the fourth quarter. The company isn’t changing its mid-term capex plan of as much as 625 million zloty ($168 million) per year after Amazon’s decision, the CEO said.

Story continues

Brzoska is betting that Poles’ embrace of online shopping is a lifestyle change that will outlast the pandemic and that the eventual lifting of virus-related restrictions won’t be a big hit for InPost’s business model.

InPost shrugs off competition risk from companies that seek to encroach on its home turf, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s AliExpress, Poland’s post office and state-run refiner and retailer PKN Orlen SA. Even as these companies may install as many as 5,000 lockers in Poland over next few years, they would still lack the technology to undermine InPost’s position, he said.

Tech Tandem

While clinching the Amazon agreement, whose business or financial details haven’t been published, Brzoska remains confident about InPost’s relationship with Allegro.eu.

The two companies signed a seven-year delivery deal in September, even as Polish marketplace plans to launch its own machines. Brzoska wants to see such step as diversification only. About 70% of Allegro’s merchandise go through InPost lockers.

“We created a tandem that has generated the biggest tech IPOs in Europe,” he said. “We achieved so much together already and I believe we can achieve even more.”

Erste’s Grygo said he expects the entry of Amazon to potentially push Allegro toward foreign expansion so it can maintain its rapid growth.

Brzoska is also looking to expand in western Europe. InPost wants to double its U.K. network of automated lockers to 2,000 machines this year. In France, where about 40% of all online purchases are delivered through the out-of-home model, it will seek to buy logistic companies running pick-up and delivery chains in early 2021.

248,2021-01-30T17:37:10+00:00,Reddit-Hedge Fund Battle Loser Candlestick Capital’s Top 10 Stock Holdings,"In this article, we reviewed Candlestick's losses from short bets and examined the top 10 holdings to determine whether its stock portfolio has the potential to recover losses. Click to skip ahead and see Candlestick Capital's Top 5 Stock Holdings.

Candlestick Capital Management, founded by former Citadel portfolio manager Jack Woodruff, is among the hedge fund losers in a tug of war with Reddit’s day traders. The hedge fund, which started fiscal 2021 with almost $3 billion, fell at a low- to mid-teens range on its short bets for the year through Wednesday. The losses came after the firm has generated annual returns of 26% in 2020, thanks to its positions in consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks. Several other hedge funds including Steve Cohen Point72 and Dan Sundheim’s D1 Capital have also lost significantly amid a buying frenzy fueled by retail day traders.

Along with other stocks, GameStop was among the main focus of Reddit’s WallStreetBets crew over the past couple of weeks. Other prominent short squeezed stocks include BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) Express (EXPR), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Koss (KOSS), and Nokia (NOK).

Hedge funds have also started closing their positions despite losses as shares of short squeezed stocks are not cooling off. Citron Research's Andrew Left, for instance, stated on Wednesday that the firm has closed most of its short position at a loss of 100% when GameStop's stock traded around $90.

One of the most well-known short bets investment firms Melvin Capital Management, which received a huge emergency cash injection of $2.75 billion from Steven Cohen, Ken Griffin, and other partners, is down 30% year to date due to its short bets on GameStop and other stocks. Reddit's army has particularly targeted short bets of former star portfolio manager for Steven A. Cohen, Gabriel Plotkin. Melvin Capital, however, closed its GameStop positions this week (see Melvin Capital's Top 10 Stock Holdings).

Story continues

Short-sellers' losses amounted to $5 billion in betting against GameStop alone, according to data from the financial-analytics firm S3 Partners. Steve Cohen's hedge fund lost almost 15% in 2021 due to bets on GameStop, while Sundheim’s D1 Capital Partners is down about 20%. D1 Capital was one of the best performing hedge funds last year. Market Crash Candlestick Capital Jack Woodruff

Maplelane Capital, which started the year with $3.5 billion and has a track record of annualized 30% gains since inception, lost about 45% this year through Wednesday amid short bets.

Besides wrong short bets in 2021, Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management has outperformed the broader market index last year and its position in consumer discretionary, consumer staples and information technology stocks are performing well since the beginning of this year.

Hedge fund industry's reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start examining Candlestick's Top 10 stock holdings to determine whether its portfolio has the ability to recover losses it incurred on short bets. The hedge fund's top 10 holdings represent 31.77% of the portfolio.

10. Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE: DRI)

Although Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI) performed well during the second half of 2020, shares of restaurant stock underperformed since the beginning of this year. Fortunately, the hedge fund has capitalized on the rally in 2020 by selling a 34% stake in the September quarter. DRI is the tenth largest stock holding of Candlestick Capital Management, accounting for 1.80% of the overall portfolio.

The market pundits are optimistic about the future performance of large restaurant stocks. ""We expect large chains to capitalize on the digital transformation to drive top-line growth, more efficient 1x1 marketing, and strategy decisions. Strong and improving unit-level economics and share opportunities from independent restaurant closures in 2020 support unit development,"" Goldman Sachs said.

9. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ: KDP)

The beverage company Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ: KDP) also underperformed compared to the tech-heavy NASDAQ and the broader market index in 2020 as well as during the first month of 2021. Its shares are up 13% in the last twelve months. KDP is the ninth-largest stock holding of Jack Woodruff’s hedge fund portfolio, accounting for 1.87% of the portfolio.

Oakmark Fund, which returned 6.2% for the third quarter, stated in an investor’s letter that Keurig Dr Pepper stock is trading at discount. Here is what Oakmark Funds stated:

“Keurig Dr Pepper is one of North America’s leading beverage companies and commands dominant positions in single-serve coffee and flavored sodas. We believe single-serve coffee pods will capture almost all of the incremental growth in at-home coffee consumption because coffee drinkers increasingly prefer K-Cups over drip brewing due to its greater convenience, quality, variety and value. Keurig’s competitive advantages (low-cost production, the largest installed base of brewers, exclusive brand partnerships) allow it to collect a toll on most pods sold in North America. The company’s soda franchises remain highly profitable, and we do not expect health-related concerns about sugar to materially impact consumption trends. We believe that Keurig’s brands should deliver steady growth, consistent market share gains and significant excess cash. We think the company is an above-average business trading at a meaningful discount to the broader market, its beverage peers and historical private market transactions.”

8. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: SEAS)

The hedge fund has used the dip in the theme park and entertainment company SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: SEAS) stock price as buying opportunity and it appears that the strategy worked for the hedge fund. Jack Woodruff has initiated a position in SeaWorld during the second quarter and increased its stake by 7% during the September quarter. SeaWorld’s share price rallied almost 86% in the last six months.

The future fundamentals of SeaWorld improved significantly after coronavirus vaccine discovery. The company had posted a revenue drop of 77% for the September quarter.

7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA)

The hedge funds strategy of buying Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) during the final quarter of 2019 didn’t work because shares of the payment technology company increased only 1.25% in the last twelve months. It is the seventh-largest stock holding of Candlestick’s 13F portfolio. However, the future fundamentals of Mastercard improved as international traveling resumed in the past couple of months.

Del Principe O’Brien Financial Advisors, which returned 8.9% for the third quarter, claimed that the dip in Mastercard stock price during last spring was a buying opportunity. Here is what Del Principe O’Brien Financial Advisors stated in an investors letter:

“The market pullback in the spring gave us a chance to become owners of Mastercard, one of the biggest players in the global payments industry. In fiscal year 2019, the company processed almost $5 trillion in purchase transactions and holds 29% of the global market share for credit cards and 24% of the global market for debit cards.

In June, Mastercard entered into an agreement to acquire Finicity, a financial data and insight provider, for a purchase price of $825 million. The move is meant to strengthen Mastercard’s existing open banking platform. Open banking is a system that gives third parties, including other banks and tech start-ups that provide financial services (think budgeting apps), digital access to financial data. A user-focused innovation in the banking industry, open banking is thought to be the future of banking. We see an active investment in its open banking platform as a good move for Mastercard toward maintaining its leadership in the global market.”

6. Coca-Cola European Partners plc (NYSE: CCEP)

Jack Woodruff’s strategy of buying Coca-Cola European Partners plc (NYSE: CCEP) stock during the pandemic related selloff worked for the hedge fund. Candlestick Capital Management has initiated a position in Coca-Cola European Partners during the second quarter and increased its stake by 90% during the September quarter. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of Candlestick’s 13F stock portfolio, accounting for 1.96% of the overall portfolio.

Shares of Coca-Cola European Partners grew 29% in the last three months compared to S&P 500 growth of 15.79%. Coca-Cola European Partners produces, distributes, and sells a range of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live on this Friday morning. Myles Udland here in New York, again, watching markets that are lower, all the action happening in some of those heavily shorted names. We're going to stay on that story all day.

But let's take a step back and talk about another sector of the market that we've certainly watched closely over the last year and could have a very interesting year ahead, and that is what's happening over in the pharmacy space. Joining us now to discuss everything happening within that business, we're joined by Syed Husain. He's a managing director over at PJ Solomon. Syed, thanks for joining the show this morning. And I'd love to just start with how COVID changed what the pharmacy sector thought of itself, what businesses thought they could do, should do, need to do, and how we're starting to see that maybe play out.

SYED HUSAIN: Well, thank you very much for having me. And COVID has had a huge impact on the world of pharmacy. And really, what I think it's done is it's hastened the transformation that was already occurring in pharmacy to a really front line, health care accessible location. And what I mean by that is I think when you look at the availability of testing and how it was ramped up so quickly, and then ultimately the plan to really leverage the pharmacy footprint for the vaccination, that really has shown the tremendous need for the pharmacy footprint, as well as the pharmacies themselves.

BRIAN SOZZI: How big a risk do you think Walmart's role in the pharmacy space is to the likes of a CVS and a Walgreens? Walmart, I would say, has very been-- has been out in front of trying to get people into its stores, whether it's for a vaccine or first testing. What type of risk does that present to the big pharmacy chains?

Story continues

SYED HUSAIN: Well, I think Walmart's always been there. I think they've now gotten into broader offerings that really CVS Health and Walgreens had already begun. For example, the CVS Health Hubs and really leveraging other usage for their footprints, as well as Walgreens' recent alignment with VillageMD and leveraging their footprint along to be primary care access points. So Walmart has now gotten into that.

So I don't know that there's dramatic risk. I think the big pharmacy chains always expected Walmart to be a stronger player. And they were already a pharmacy player.

JULIE HYMAN: Syed, what do some of the business combinations going forward potentially look like? I mean, there are definitely some startups that are in the pharmacy business now. You also have all these telehealth players that have come out. Does it make sense for some of the big pharmacy chains to make those kinds of acquisitions?

SYED HUSAIN: Yeah, that's a really good question, Julie. When I think about M&A activity in the pharmacy space, I really look at kind of three reasonings-- one, economic headwinds and tailwinds, tailwinds being margin compression and-- I'm sorry, headwinds being margin compression, and the tailwinds really being the amount of capital that's available to invest in health care and pharmacy.

And then, to your point, competitive disruption, right? New players like Amazon getting into pharmacy, Medly Pharmacy, a digital player that's out there, as well as things like Hims & Hers that have more of a direct-to-consumer kind of platform. I think what that's really done is it's caused the large strategics to really take a step back, and rather than talk about it, really invest and have an omnichannel presence.

I don't think that the future is one or the other. It's not going to be all digital or all physical. I think you have to have an omnichannel presence, because one thing we've learned through COVID is consumers want a choice. They want a choice that's convenient for them. They want accessibility that is convenient for them. And a true omnichannel gives them that. So I think what you'll do-- you'll see is M&A activities, and with financial sponsors, as well as large strategics, looking at filling in those gaps so that all of-- that everyone has that true omnichannel presence.

BRIAN SOZZI: We learned this week that Roz Brewer is coming in as the CEO of Walgreens. Do you think mission critical for her is splitting up the Walgreens Boots Alliance business and just getting Walgreens focused on its US core pharmacy operations?

SYED HUSAIN: I do. I think that that's a good way to look at that. I think her mission critical is probably doing that, but at the same time very quickly getting familiar with the US pharmacy and health-care business in preparation for vaccination efforts and the transformation within the pharmacy business model to get pharmacists to practice at the higher end of their license. So I think those are really the primary things that she needs to jump over. I think corporate will handle kind of the separation and the transition of the wholesale business.

But she very quickly-- and now is the time, right? Now is the time. And she really needs to become an expert on the pharmacy business per se, especially as the pharmacy business model transitioned for less of a dispensing role and more of a primary-care health-care role, where pharmacists are practicing at the higher end of their license with adherence programming, vaccination, and assisting payers with improving star ratings and lowering health-care costs.

Remember, one of the key things is specialty pharmacy is growing at a bigger amount than any other segment within pharmacy for that pharmacy dollar. And those specialty drugs are expensive. They're great breakthrough therapies, but they're expensive and they require high touch usage. And so clinical pharmacists need to be involved in ensuring that those products are used correctly.

MYLES UDLAND: Really interesting stuff, Syed, and I think something that we maybe don't think enough about the role that pharmacists play in this whole system. And it certainly sounds like it's going to be a larger role within the health system as we go forward in the years ahead. And I hope we'll stay in touch to talk about that. Syed Husain, managing director at PJ Solomon, really appreciate you taking the time this morning.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Who are your role models, Mabarak, in terms of tech CEOs and leaders and maybe people in other fields of endeavor. For instance, Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Do you, do you look to them?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I'd say I look to Bill Gates quite a bit from an aspect of competitiveness and from an aspect of focus, because he has this ability to look at things and look at them to a level that, until he gets what he wants. But I think what I borrow mostly, who I borrow mostly from is Warren Buffett, because I think Warren Buffett represents, he represents a mature American business person that is so neatly organized and thorough and to the point.

ANDY SERWER: Have you ever met Warren Buffett or been to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: No, but I will one day.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the rest of your career and your life, Mubarak? You're only 26 years old. What are your aspirations? What do you hope to achieve over the next decade and throughout your lifetime?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: You know, I think the most important thing is to figure out a way in which I can make enterprise software basically accessible to all. That's around the world, just not in Africa. Thanks to statistics and newly acquired information that informs insight on multiple things. So I think for the foreseeable decade that, I think, is what I really want to achieve, because what we've been able to do is make enterprise software standard, which was something that was really not possible in the past.

ANDY SERWER: And last question, Mubarak if you could ask Warren Buffett one question, what would it be?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I'd say investment, but then, yeah, I'd say investments.

ANDY SERWER: You'd ask him about investment?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Right. Not actually investment, but actually, ask him to invest with me.

ANDY SERWER: Oh, you would ask him to invest. Right. Good one. Love it. All right, we're going to have to leave it there, Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace. Thank you so much for joining us, Mubarak.

Levi Strauss Co. (NYSE:LEVI) released its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closed on Jan. 27. The company recorded higher than expected earnings and revenue for the quarter as strong online sales negated sales loss due to pandemic-related store closures. However, results were down on a year-over-year basis.

Performance at a glance

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with LEVI. Click here to check it out.  LEVI 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of LEVI Peter Lynch Chart of LEVI

The San Francisco-based manufacturer of denim products posted adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents, which exceeded analysts' expectations of EPS of 15 cents. Revenue of $1.39 billion tumbled 12% on a year-over-year basis, but edged past estimates of $1.34 billion.

Reflecting on the company's performance, executive vice president and chief financial officer Harmit Singh said:

""We delivered strong results through the last months of our fiscal year despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, including beating our revenue and Adjusted EPS expectations while posting a record fourth-quarter gross margin. While the future impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain in the near term, our sequentially-improving performance, financial discipline and focus on operational excellence have given us the confidence in our ability to execute our strategies against the things within our control, and, if conditions do not worsen, return the company to pre-pandemic revenues by the end of 2021, with Adjusted EBIT margins of twelve percent or more.""

E-commerce sales grew 34% in the reported quarter and accounted for 23% of the company's total quarterly revenue. The growth includes both sales on Levi.com and its wholesale partners like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The company noted its wholesale channel sales dropped 15% in the reported quarter, while the direct-to-consumer business fell 5%.

At the end of the quarter, the company had total liquidity of about $2.3 billion. In addition, the company has another $714 million available under its revolving credit facility.

A closer look

The company reported sales declines in all regions as stores remained shut for the majority of the quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak. Sales fell 12% in the U.S., 9% in Europe and 14% in Asia. Online sales in all the segments were strong, but not enough to make up for the loss of sales due to store closures.

The company's women's business flourished during the quarter, courtesy of robust demand for blouses, shorts and jeans. Presently, women's apparel account for 37% of Levi's total sales, up from 20% in 2015. The company strategizes to boost the women's category such that it accounts for 50% of the top line in the long term.

The jeans maker reported in July that it would cut 700 jobs, which is equal to 15% of its global corporate workforce, in an effort to trim costs. Berg said that the move would result in annual savings of $100 million.

Guidance

For the first quarter of 2021, the clothing company is guiding for earnings of around 20 cents to 24 cents per share. This is lower than the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate of 33 cents.

Video Transcript

- At some point, you applied to Harvard, though--

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Right.

- --and then got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: What was the case was this. When I won the award the very first time at national level, the thing became, what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, Chris Kirubi? So he had been an alumni of Harvard, so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school.

And he had gotten to almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time, so I was supported through the whole application process. And it was really an amazing experience, but then it got to a point, where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this on [? Zetia. ?] So it brought in, like, a new dynamic in the competition.

Because for the first time, what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds. They already had employees, and they were already competing. And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them, so it became a situation, where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead, so that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a weight on this.

And actually, what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of, like, three years by the time I came to think about it again.

Story continues

- Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to-- every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. And at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind, so I wouldn't say, I regret. I just think that there was a different path to take.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/business-growth-africa-depends-big-110000591.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0P00012B2W.TO', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'ASBCX.US', 'ASBFX.US', 'BB.US', 'CAAFX.US', 'CCAMX.US', 'CEAMX.US', 'CFAMX.US', 'CSCO.US', 'FB.US', 'FFTSX.US', 'FSBTX.US', 'FTSBX.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US']",['HARVARD'],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.187}"
258,2021-01-27T19:25:33+00:00,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: There is ‘a big crisis right now’ for cybersecurity,"Microsoft (MSFT) is officially a cybersecurity giant. For the first time on Tuesday, Microsoft disclosed revenue from its various security offerings as part of its quarterly earnings — $10 billion over the last 12 months.

That amounts to a 40% year-over-year jump in the growing security business, making up roughly 7% of the company’s total revenue for the previous year.

“We waited in some sense [until] this milestone to show the depth, the breadth, the span of what we are doing,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Wednesday, a day after the company released its quarterly earnings report.

“And, you know, [there’s] a lot of work ahead, but we are investing very heavily because guess what? You know 10 years from now we'll still be talking about it as technology becomes even [a deeper part] of our lives in our society in all critical industries.”

The $10 billion figure comes from the security-related revenue generated by services including Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory, Intune, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Office 365, Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Information and Governance, Azure Sentinel, Azure Monitoring, and Azure Information Protection. In this May 6, 2019, file photo Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at Build, the company's annual conference for software developers in Seattle. AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)

Each of those makes up what Microsoft calls its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. Those overarching segments generated $14.6 billion and $13.4 billion in revenue, respectively, in the company’s fiscal Q2 2021.

“What we have built is very helpful in times of crisis and there is a big crisis right now,” Nadella said. “But you need to sort of obviously build all of this over a period of years if not decades and then sustain it through not just product innovation, but also I would say, practice every day.”

The announcement follows Microsoft’s involvement in uncovering the breadth of the massive SolarWinds cyber attack in December, which hit private companies like cybersecurity firm FireEye (FEYE) and government agencies including the Treasury, Commerce, and State Departments, as well as the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.

Story continues

Microsoft itself was also hacked, though no customer data was breached. A Reuters report indicated that, as part of the hack of the National Telecommunications and Information Agency, Microsoft’s Office 365 software was attacked, allowing the intruders to monitor agency emails for months. Microsoft, however, said at the time that it has identified no vulnerabilities in its cloud or Office software.

Though hit by the attack, Microsoft also worked with the government and customers to help determine the scale of the hack.

“I was most proud that we became the first responders for this attack,” Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft corporate vice president of security, compliance, and identity marketing, told Yahoo Finance.

“We were the defenders that other defenders were turning to. We were working with FireEye and across the public sector and private sector coming together saying ‘What should we do, and how should we protect our world against it?’ ” she said. The U.S. Treasury Department was one of the victims of the SolarWinds hack. (Image: Xinhua/ via Getty Images)

Part of Microsoft’s ability to respond to the hack has to do with what’s called “zero trust” architecture, Nadella explained. Essentially that means a company’s cybersecurity capabilities always function as though there has been a breach of some kind. It’s a defense against being left flatfooted when a new hack comes along that you’re not able to protect against.

“One of the things about Microsoft’s investment is really not just about the security investment — which is substantial when you look at Defender or Sentinel or Azure Active Directory and the list goes on — but it is that ability to take all of our investments in AI and data and infrastructure and bring it to bear for security,” Nadella said. “And that I think is what makes us pretty unique.”

Working from home adds to companies’ security needs

The SolarWinds hack came as the coronavirus pandemic spurred many companies to allow their employees to work from home, which introduced a new attack vector for hackers. When you’re working from your office, you’re, hopefully, hooked into a secured connection that can monitor for things like malware or other strange network activity.

At home, though, you’re running on your own network, adding a wrinkle to your employer’s ability to protect itself. It wouldn’t take much for you to download malware on your computer at home, then accidentally send that software to your company’s systems when you connect to its network to update a spreadsheet or upload a report.

“Security has to be built in at every single point,” Jakkal said. “It cannot be an afterthought,”

Microsoft says it currently protects more than 400,000 customers across 120 countries, including 90 Fortune 100 companies. The tech giant breaks its security offerings down into four categories: security, compliance, identity, and management.

Part of that includes providing security not just for Microsoft-powered devices, but those running Apple’s (AAPL) iOS and macOS and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android, as well as products running on competing cloud platforms like Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Google’s Google Cloud Platform.

“There needs to be a real different approach to creating a cybersecurity solution for customers,” Nadella said.

“In what is an interconnected world it's not about any one point solution, it is about having, I would say, an architectural approach, which then needs to be reinforced every day.”

As cloud services continue to expand, and Microsoft’s stake in the industry grows alongside it, protecting the customers who use those services will prove ever more important.

“It is not just transformation in order for you to remain in business. You need to have that digital control plane, not just for your workers so that they can log on to their PCs from home and be on Teams calls,” Nadella said.

“Your manufacturing plant needs to continue where the engineers, the operational data all need to be reasoned over. That is the transformation that I think we are seeing the acceleration of.”

Of course, hackers and cybercriminals will continue to hit at businesses regardless of what company they have protecting them. But with the continued growth in cloud computing and an expanded work-from-home environment, Microsoft stands to benefit as a player in the cybersecurity industry.

Gabriel Plotkin’s hedge fund Melvin Capital Management’s short-bets against GameStop (NYSE: GME) and a few other stocks went the wrong way and resulted in hefty losses. Melvin Capital, which started the year with $12.5 billion of assets under management, is down 30% year to date according to media reports. The 42-year-old Gabriel Plotkin, however, received an emergency cash injection of $2.75 billion from Steve Cohen's Point 72, Ken Griffin's Citadel, and other partners in the battle against Reddit's WallStreetBets crew.

“I am incredibly proud to partner with Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen,” Plotkin said. “The team at Melvin is eager to get to work and reward the confidence of these two great investment icons.”

CNBC on Wednesday reported that Melvin Capital closed out of GameStop's short position and Melvin manager Gabe Plotkin stated that speculations about a bankruptcy filing are false.

The day trader’s army on Reddit has been calling to buy and avoid selling in order to boost GameStop stock price. Fortunately, they have been successful as shares of GameStop rallied 685% this year to around $147 at the end of Tuesday trading. Other short sellers have also been in trouble as GME shares extend the upside trend. GameStop short-sellers have lost $5 billion in 2021, according to data from the financial-analytics firm S3 Partners. Gabriel Plotkin Melvin Capital Management

Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also jumped into the rally and started following WallStreetBets forum's move of buying GME stock. He tweeted ""Lot's of $GME talk soooooo.... We bought Feb $115 calls on $GME this morning. Let's gooooooo!!!!!!!!.""

Tesla founder Elon Musk also entered into the GameStop phenomena on Tuesday with a one-word tweet “Gamestonk” and reports indicate that Musk tweet pumped in $4 billion into the GameStop stock. Share of videogame retailer rallied 92% on Tuesday and added another 50% in the post-market trading.

Story continues

A former star portfolio manager for Steven A. Cohen, Gabriel Plotkin has also been facing stiff competition on his other short bets from Reddit's day traders.

The fight started two months ago after a Reddit user posted a video with the title “GME Squeeze and the Demise of Melvin Capital”. That post went viral among Reddit users and even they have started mentioning other stocks that Melvin Capital is shorting. Melvin Capital has placed dozen of other short bets and reports show that many of those stocks are also soaring.

Bed Bath and Beyond (NYSE: BBBY) is among those short bets of Gabriel Plotkin’s hedge fund and it is soaring at a massive pace. Shares of BBBY are up 107% since the beginning of this year, thanks to Reddit users buying strategy. Several other stocks have also seen surprisingly high volume and stock price surge in the past few days.

Besides the latest losses, Melvin Capital Management has a strong track record of generating big returns for investors. The firm's short or long bets paid off as its average returns stand around 30% since its inception in 2014.

While Gabriel Plotkin’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let's start our countdown on Melvin Capital Management’s top ten stock holdings to determine how its stock holdings are performing in a fight against Reddit users.

10. AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO)

Shares of AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) underperformed in the last twelve months due to coronavirus spread and social distancing policies. The hedge fund has slashed its 52% stake in Autozone during the September quarter. Despite that, the automotive retailer is the tenth largest stock holding of Melvin Capital, accounting for 2.42% of the overall portfolio.

Meanwhile, AutoZone's board of directors believes that shares are undervalued and authorized to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion of common stock after repurchasing more than $650 million of common stock in the September quarter. The company has also been reporting strong financial numbers despite pandemic related pressure. Its September quarter revenue of $3.15 billion grew 12.9% from the year-ago period while operating profit increased 35% year over year.

9. Pinterest, Inc (NYSE: PINS)

Gabriel Plotkin is bullish on Pinterest, Inc (NYSE: PINS) as Melvin Capital has raised its position in Pinterest by 173% in the third quarter after initiating a big position in the second quarter. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Melvin Capital, accounting for 2.48% of the 13F portfolio. Fortunately, Gabriel Plotkin's strategy worked for his hedge fund because the share price of Pinterest rallied more than 200% in the last twelve months.

Argosy Investors, which returned 29.8% in select accounts in 2020, stated in the investor's letter that the firm has capitalized on the strong share price rally of Pinterest. Here is what Argosy Investors stated:

“With that in mind, we trimmed Pinterest (PINS) multiple times during the fourth quarter as the price increased over 200% from our initial purchase price in November 2019. This was a starter position for us at the time, and this is one of those stocks that investors kept buying because of Pinterest’s perceived benefit from stay-at-home orders. We agree that the lockdowns likely forced people globally to try things they wouldn’t have normally. As the CEO of Post Holdings (POST), Rob Vitale, said on a recent conference call about customers trying cereal while stuck at home, “that level of trial would have been extremely expensive and challenging to obtain”. Similarly, we believe people tried and liked Pinterest at a rate that would be extremely expensive for them to acquire through advertising.”

8. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Melvin Capital has taken advantage of its Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) position. The hedge fund has reduced its 45% stake in the world’s largest e-commerce platform in the third quarter to capitalize on the stunning share price rally. Amazon's stock price surged close to 80% in the last twelve months on the back of social distancing policies.

Other hedge funds are also bullish on Amazon. L1 Capital International Fund, which returned 5.1% for the quarter, highlighted the growth prospects of Amazon in an investor’s letter. Here is what L1 Capital stated:

“Several investments in the technology sector were trimmed on valuation grounds with the proceeds used to increase our investment in Amazon. Amazon’s successful flywheel business model and Amazon Web Services are well known. However, we believe the current share price under‑appreciates:

– The consistency and longevity of Amazon’s growth potential in its key businesses;

– The importance of additional revenue streams such as advertising which are high margin and growing rapidly; and

– The strengthening barriers to competition and competitive advantages arising from Amazon’s stepped‑up investment in logistics and other infrastructure.”

7. Advance Auto Parts Inc (NYSE: AAP)

Automotive retailer Advance Auto Parts Inc (NYSE: AAP) is the ninth-largest stock holding of Melvin Capital, accounting for 2.84% of the overall portfolio. Shares of Advance Auto Parts underperformed in the last twelve months compared to the broader market index. Slower revenue growth due to virus spread and lockdowns negatively impacted Advanced Auto Parts' performance in the past couple of quarters.

Diamond Hill Capital stated in an investor's letter that Advanced Auto Parts is set to improve its market share and margins. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated:

“Advance Auto Parts, Inc. is a leader in the automotive aftermarket parts retail market where the top companies produce some of the best margins in all of retail. Following a complex acquisition in 2014, Advance underperformed and lost market share under the leadership of a previous management team. The company is executing well on a plan to gain market share and materially improve margins.”

6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE: NOW)

Melvin Capital Management has been holding a stake in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE: NOW) since 2017 and the firm has raised its stake by 63% in the September quarter. The hedge fund has benefited from its ServiceNow position because shares of cloud computing company rallied 72% in the last twelve months, extending the five years gains to 580%.

The revenue growth is supported by robust financial performance. The company has generated 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the September quarter while it has also raised its subscription revenue and billings guidance for the full year.

""In a challenging pandemic environment, Q3 was a fantastic quarter for ServiceNow. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, underscoring the power of our product portfolio and our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Overall, we see strong momentum heading into the last quarter of the year and our robust pipeline gives me confidence in our ability to continue executing well into 2021. I’m very excited about the traction we are seeing in our journey towards becoming a $10 billion revenue company and the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century,"" says ServiceNow CFO Gina Mastantuono.

260,2021-01-27T15:57:04+00:00,GameStop (GME) Casualty Melvin Capital’s Top 10 Stock Holdings,"In this article, we discussed Melvin Capital Management’s short bets that resulted in big losses along with its top 10 stock holdings. Click to skip ahead and see Melvin Capital's Top 5 Stock Holdings.

Gabriel Plotkin’s hedge fund Melvin Capital Management’s short-bets against GameStop (NYSE: GME) and a few other stocks went the wrong way and resulted in hefty losses. Melvin Capital, which started the year with $12.5 billion of assets under management, is down 30% year to date according to media reports. The 42-year-old Gabriel Plotkin, however, received an emergency cash injection of $2.75 billion from Steve Cohen's Point 72, Ken Griffin's Citadel, and other partners in the battle against Reddit's WallStreetBets crew.

“I am incredibly proud to partner with Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen,” Plotkin said. “The team at Melvin is eager to get to work and reward the confidence of these two great investment icons.”

CNBC on Wednesday reported that Melvin Capital closed out of GameStop's short position and Melvin manager Gabe Plotkin stated that speculations about a bankruptcy filing are false.

The day trader’s army on Reddit has been calling to buy and avoid selling in order to boost GameStop stock price. Fortunately, they have been successful as shares of GameStop rallied 685% this year to around $147 at the end of Tuesday trading. Other short sellers have also been in trouble as GME shares extend the upside trend. GameStop short-sellers have lost $5 billion in 2021, according to data from the financial-analytics firm S3 Partners. Gabriel Plotkin Melvin Capital Management

Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya also jumped into the rally and started following WallStreetBets forum's move of buying GME stock. He tweeted ""Lot's of $GME talk soooooo.... We bought Feb $115 calls on $GME this morning. Let's gooooooo!!!!!!!!.""

Tesla founder Elon Musk also entered into the GameStop phenomena on Tuesday with a one-word tweet “Gamestonk” and reports indicate that Musk tweet pumped in $4 billion into the GameStop stock. Share of videogame retailer rallied 92% on Tuesday and added another 50% in the post-market trading.

A former star portfolio manager for Steven A. Cohen, Gabriel Plotkin has also been facing stiff competition on his other short bets from Reddit's day traders.

The fight started two months ago after a Reddit user posted a video with the title “GME Squeeze and the Demise of Melvin Capital”. That post went viral among Reddit users and even they have started mentioning other stocks that Melvin Capital is shorting. Melvin Capital has placed dozen of other short bets and reports show that many of those stocks are also soaring.

Bed Bath and Beyond (NYSE: BBBY) is among those short bets of Gabriel Plotkin’s hedge fund and it is soaring at a massive pace. Shares of BBBY are up 107% since the beginning of this year, thanks to Reddit users buying strategy. Several other stocks have also seen surprisingly high volume and stock price surge in the past few days.

Besides the latest losses, Melvin Capital Management has a strong track record of generating big returns for investors. The firm's short or long bets paid off as its average returns stand around 30% since its inception in 2014.

While Gabriel Plotkin’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Let's start our countdown on Melvin Capital Management’s top ten stock holdings to determine how its stock holdings are performing in a fight against Reddit users.

10. AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE: AZO)

Shares of AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) underperformed in the last twelve months due to coronavirus spread and social distancing policies. The hedge fund has slashed its 52% stake in Autozone during the September quarter. Despite that, the automotive retailer is the tenth largest stock holding of Melvin Capital, accounting for 2.42% of the overall portfolio.

Meanwhile, AutoZone's board of directors believes that shares are undervalued and authorized to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion of common stock after repurchasing more than $650 million of common stock in the September quarter. The company has also been reporting strong financial numbers despite pandemic related pressure. Its September quarter revenue of $3.15 billion grew 12.9% from the year-ago period while operating profit increased 35% year over year.

9. Pinterest, Inc (NYSE: PINS)

Gabriel Plotkin is bullish on Pinterest, Inc (NYSE: PINS) as Melvin Capital has raised its position in Pinterest by 173% in the third quarter after initiating a big position in the second quarter. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Melvin Capital, accounting for 2.48% of the 13F portfolio. Fortunately, Gabriel Plotkin's strategy worked for his hedge fund because the share price of Pinterest rallied more than 200% in the last twelve months.

Argosy Investors, which returned 29.8% in select accounts in 2020, stated in the investor's letter that the firm has capitalized on the strong share price rally of Pinterest. Here is what Argosy Investors stated:

“With that in mind, we trimmed Pinterest (PINS) multiple times during the fourth quarter as the price increased over 200% from our initial purchase price in November 2019. This was a starter position for us at the time, and this is one of those stocks that investors kept buying because of Pinterest’s perceived benefit from stay-at-home orders. We agree that the lockdowns likely forced people globally to try things they wouldn’t have normally. As the CEO of Post Holdings (POST), Rob Vitale, said on a recent conference call about customers trying cereal while stuck at home, “that level of trial would have been extremely expensive and challenging to obtain”. Similarly, we believe people tried and liked Pinterest at a rate that would be extremely expensive for them to acquire through advertising.”

8. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Melvin Capital has taken advantage of its Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) position. The hedge fund has reduced its 45% stake in the world’s largest e-commerce platform in the third quarter to capitalize on the stunning share price rally. Amazon's stock price surged close to 80% in the last twelve months on the back of social distancing policies.

Other hedge funds are also bullish on Amazon. L1 Capital International Fund, which returned 5.1% for the quarter, highlighted the growth prospects of Amazon in an investor’s letter. Here is what L1 Capital stated:

“Several investments in the technology sector were trimmed on valuation grounds with the proceeds used to increase our investment in Amazon. Amazon’s successful flywheel business model and Amazon Web Services are well known. However, we believe the current share price under‑appreciates:

– The consistency and longevity of Amazon’s growth potential in its key businesses;

– The importance of additional revenue streams such as advertising which are high margin and growing rapidly; and

– The strengthening barriers to competition and competitive advantages arising from Amazon’s stepped‑up investment in logistics and other infrastructure.”

7. Advance Auto Parts Inc (NYSE: AAP)

Automotive retailer Advance Auto Parts Inc (NYSE: AAP) is the ninth-largest stock holding of Melvin Capital, accounting for 2.84% of the overall portfolio. Shares of Advance Auto Parts underperformed in the last twelve months compared to the broader market index. Slower revenue growth due to virus spread and lockdowns negatively impacted Advanced Auto Parts' performance in the past couple of quarters.

Diamond Hill Capital stated in an investor's letter that Advanced Auto Parts is set to improve its market share and margins. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated:

“Advance Auto Parts, Inc. is a leader in the automotive aftermarket parts retail market where the top companies produce some of the best margins in all of retail. Following a complex acquisition in 2014, Advance underperformed and lost market share under the leadership of a previous management team. The company is executing well on a plan to gain market share and materially improve margins.”

6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE: NOW)

Melvin Capital Management has been holding a stake in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE: NOW) since 2017 and the firm has raised its stake by 63% in the September quarter. The hedge fund has benefited from its ServiceNow position because shares of cloud computing company rallied 72% in the last twelve months, extending the five years gains to 580%.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: At some point you applied to Harvard, though, and got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, what was the case was this. When I won the award in my very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, [INAUDIBLE].

So he had been an alumni of Harvard. And so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he got into the almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time. So I was supported through the whole application process. And was really an amazing experience.

But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this [INAUDIBLE]. So it brought in like a new dynamic in the competition, because for the first time what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing.

And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them. So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a wait on this.

And actually what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. So at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret it.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: It's often said that life is about the journey, not the destination. Well, Mubarak Muyika's path to success is like none you've ever heard. Growing up in Kenya's middle class and orphaned at a young age, opportunities in a tech industry were limited. But as Mubarak tells it, he refused to be a victim. Driven by his competitive spirit and win at all cost attitude, Mubarak first revealed his knack for technology by taking the top spot in not one, but two, nationwide science fairs and went on to launch a web services business at the age of 17.

Now at 26 years old, Mubarak is in Silicon Valley with a new company and a dream to bring big tech to Africa's small businesses. In this episode of Influencers, I'm joined by Mubarak Muyika, founder and president of Zagace, as we discuss his entrepreneurial journey, why he turned down a scholarship from Harvard, and what he admires about billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.

[INTERLUDE MUSIC]

- Hello and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace, an enterprise software company, and Mubarak joins us from Nairobi. Mubarak, nice to see you.

- Thank you very much for having me here.

- So I want to ask you about your company, and it's fascinating, and you've got an incredible story. First of all, why don't you tell us about what Zagace does.

- Zagace is an enterprise management platform that seeks to make enterprise software basic and accessible to all with a focus for small businesses. That's basically what Zagace does, and that's what it is.

ANDY SERWER: And who do you compete with? And who are your customers? And how does that all work?

Story continues

MUBARAK MUYIKA: We compete with a number of customers that are described as point tools. So the first point tool that we consider a competitor is Quickbooks, Quickbooks and TurboTax. These are primary competitors, but they don't address the direct line of business that we're in because we have a suit of products that focus on making a full experience for small businesses, but TurboTax and Quickbooks tend to focus more on accounting and the taxation piece.

So we tend to address a wide range of business, small business needs. So you find that small customers tend to use a variety of tools. They could use Excel at one point, you could use a different subscription, so when you tend to look at the experience of a small business, it's more like-- it's just a chaotic alternative to Zagace. They are-- they have all these subscriptions they have to use.

- And are your customers in Africa? Are they all over the world?

- We have customers in over 60 countries. Our primary and largest customer market is in Africa, but then over time, the business-- the business needs and the business pardons are almost the same in different parts of the world. So it's enabled us to acquire customers from different parts of the world.

- I want to talk about your story, as I mentioned. It's a pretty incredible one, but you had personal tragedy. You were orphaned at a young age, and then started a business when you were 17. Can you talk about your upbringing first for us?

- OK, so I grew up-- I grew up in a household that was pretty middle-class from a Kenyan standard. At the time, that's in the 90s, being born in the 90s. My dad being a civil servant. So it was a pretty middle-class standard type of lifestyle. And then when my dad passed on, there used to be a number of circumstances that we started to experience that's from we were having issues keeping up with our active lifestyle, our beating on beetles, living a single mother, so it was really a challenge. So in all that period, it was an environment that was super competitive because we used to have multiple relatives and multiple friends that we didn't have. Suddenly, we couldn't keep up. So it used to feel like it was really a big deal to keep up.

So in that whole process, at a later time a couple of years later, I lost my mom, too. So when I lost my mom, it became a point where it required that I personally start to take care my younger brother and start to be like, I thought a thing, and make sure that all problems that we have are solved, not more than just it, but they needed kind of solutions. So in that whole process where multiple relatives supported, and then in the whole process of supporting, I had grown up being a competitive person. That's from my childhood. I like video games. I've always wanted to win. So it was always a thing of mine.

So in that whole process, I figure that, me, I'm not going to be a victim of any of this kind of stuff. So my only thing is that what's my play? And how I'm going to win. So that's what I became my focus. So when I got into high school, the very first thing that really changed my perspective in high school was the fact that I actually never got into a high school that I really wanted to because I kind of felt like, it wasn't the really best, but it was really good. And so it made me feel like I got beat at some point, something that I'm not used to. You know, I've gotten used to winning, getting what I want.

So when you fail to get that at some point, it makes you feel like you need to compete even better. So when that began to happen in high school, we had this situation or school arrangement where there were science fairs that you could participate in, and compete in schools all over the country. So it had multiple stages. So you'd have to come up with, a project convince people to with you convince multiple people to support it by allocating resources and multiple things.

So from that whole experience I got into it I go to a national level when I was about 17. That was I was actually-- I was actually not 17. I was 16. Then that was just I was the youngest person to get to the national level. It was a completely new experience. For the first time at my age I could see people from different schools. I had a perspective that was a national level. So the whole thing about it was that it became a new reality that I had to embrace.

So with that, the following year now, I became the best, and when I became the best at national level, I had known a couple of people so many times. So the thing was now, what's the next thing? The next thing was now how do I look at it from an international level? So you know that in high school, I won two awards at the national level. And that's the science fairs, although I had multiple projects, all of them at the national level. But the two of them that I won was more of a perspective of things that were my interests, things that I liked, and things that I really believed were the best.

And so with that, it changed my game from an aspect of persons that I interacted with because the largest companies in Kenya were the ones supporting the events. So it felt like a really new experience. So with that, a whole new angle came in. Some of the participants that were in older theme, I'd really defeated them, and then there was this aspect of an African competition called the Anzisha prize. So it used to be it was more like I'd been beaten at a point or something that I didn't know about. So I entered it the following year, and I actually won an award for the work that I was doing with a company called Hype Century.

So Hype Century was a company that I started when I was in my final year in high school. The specific thing about it was it came as a result of my initial innovation, which was creation of a database to track multiple tracking tracks for oil tankers, and for just purposes of management office of management of a business. So with all that I used to get requests from clients to build websites, and then in that whole process of building websites, the clients was starting to stock up. And when they started to build so many, what used to be the case I got-- I decided to structure our business in which companies could pay subscriptions.

- And then, let me just jump in here, so at some point, you applied to Harvard though,

- Right.

- And then got a scholarship but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

- What was the case was this: when I won the award in my-- the very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level? Which was the advice of multiple partners and teachers and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting that the whole event, Chris Kerubi. So he had been an alumni of Harvard, and so it felt like the next best thing to do-- considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he'd got into almost the highest level from a business perspective --so I applied to Harvard, and it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time.

So I was supported through the whole application process, and it was really an amazing experience. But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had set some of my peers, had actually won an award which was this Anzisha. So it brought in a new dynamic in the competition because for the first time, what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing, and that would take me five years behind for me to actually catch up with them.

So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this, I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide I can put a wait on this, and actually, what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first, then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

- Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

- I actually-- I never thought about it like that because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs because the problem at the time was I used to-- every time I look at multiple people and peers I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me? So that whole thing used to be like that, so and at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret, I just think that there was a different path to take.

- Right. And you made your way to Silicon Valley eventually. Talk to us about that.

- Yeah, so the very first thing was, you know, with this whole experience about raising money, reality started to set in from a business perspective. So the ecosystem in Kenya and Africa is pretty much very small, and the equals really small at the time. So from a fundraising perspective, we were looking at a situation where I already had close to 1,000 business customers in Nairobi from a perspective of 2013-2014.

That was really huge because if you have really huge corporate customers, any expansion in business would mean extending into a business line that's outside of my scope of excellence, or my scope of expertise. So it got to a point where the only most relevant place where it would be practical to expand to and move to, would be the Bay area because of the time, I had multiple contacts I had interacted with from investors to customers to different mentors who were helping out, and they had multiple people that had been supported to move to the Bay Area to raise funding, get customers, so it became a thing that was the next best thing to do when you reach a certain customer point. So it is at that point that it became obvious and necessary that moving into the Bay Area is the next most practical thing.

So what I decided to do, I decided that this is an important and crucial thing. So I made a business decision to decide to expand to the Bay Area. That was like having the company registered, getting an office, and moving to the Bay Area to start initially with a focus to get investors. But then when I got to the Bay Area, the thing of the time was I didn't think that it would turn out the way it did because I think the experience was so blissful because 1, at the time, there was this thing that Obama was a Kenyan.

So when I got to the Bay Area, being a Kenyan was just like the coolest thing I'd ever experienced in my life. I was treated so well. I was invited to so many places. I used to get so many messages and so many emails that it took me to close to two years to actually read them because at the time, the experience was just exciting. That whole process, I figure that there's actually a possibility of value and expansion in terms of business from things like joint ventures, from things like partnerships, where products can actually-- products from Africa can actually be sold to different customers bundled together and that whole that whole thing.

So in that whole process, I figured out a way in which we can structure a corporation. That's good advice from multiple mentors and multiple partners who are helping out, and that's pretty much how I ended up in the Bay Area. Then ever since, it's been more like-- it's been more like a thing that's been really good because it's really helped the business development around the world because that single thing has given Zagace the ability to acquire customers in multiple places around the world with so much ease, and the level of sophistication also changed significantly because the amount of data that we were working with in Nairobi as a Nairobi company, is really different from what we do now as a multinational company. And then the operations--

- And you mentioned how it was advantageous to be from Africa when Barack Obama was president, had things gotten more difficult when Donald Trump was president? Because, of course, he notoriously denigrated African countries.

- I'd say that Trump is more of a businessman than Obama, so the thing is what happens is that at the time, people didn't meet me like a businessman. People met me as a Kenyan. So during Trump's time, I did both. I had grown up so my interactions with people are more business, terms, agreements. So I'd say that it didn't affect much, it was just at a different time, and not grown up.

- Right, OK. So Zagace found a market in the trend of African companies going online. Where does that trend stand now? And has COVID-19 accelerated that?

- Big time, big time. As of today, we are doing close to 10 million sign-ups-- businesses that we've acquired through multiple product stocks from businesses that have signed up online from resellers or partnerships. With all that, we've gotten approximately two million customers. So this whole process is-- 70% of the customers come from Africa, and it's largely driven by COVID-19.

And then the other thing about it is that what's really driving growth in Africa isn't really COVID-19, it's about big tech politics in the Bay Area, because you realize that the technical system in Africa isn't controlled in Africa. If you want to expand a business in Africa, it doesn't make sense to really invest in Africa. You invest in the Bay Area, because that's where the talent that's where is the big tech. And so it's more of we are at the point where the next billion customers for the big tech, the big five, are going to come from Africa. We are talking about a population that's going to be joining the internet as users or becoming banked users. That's from an aspect of fintech.

Persons who have no-- persons who have no access to banking facilities or have no access to internet, and it also presents a direct opportunity considering the countries are so many, and it's so different. So regulation is easy to go around as compared to a country like India, which offers the same opportunity for big tech in the Bay Area. So the thing about it becomes that the only way we can live with the trend in Africa, to become a big tech company in Africa, we have to be like the big five in the Bay Area, and they're like, we are, we follow them, so we're just like a bear on their back.

- Let me-- I want to get back to Zagace in a minute though, but I want to ask you about COVID in Kenya and in East Africa generally? What is the situation like there right now?

- The situation-- I think the situation is really-- could be really bad, but the problem is that 1, the economy is really bad. And then the process of tracking it is really slow. So we cannot get an accurate picture in the short term. So right now the information is foggy and hazy, but what I'd say the situation could be really bad because what's on the ground and what's reported takes time before you can actually match the two.

- Right. So getting back to your company, how big is it right now, Mubarak, in terms of revenue? And what are the key ingredients for growth?

- I think from an aspect of last year, we did around $2 million in revenue. And the key aspects of growth are we're talking about users, APIs, those are just the main things that are driving growth in the short term. And here we're talking about users, we talk about small businesses, and individual solopreneurs.

- Right, and how fast is the company growing right now? How do you measure that?

- I'd say during-- since COVID started, we've done close to 5 million sign-ups, businesses that we would never had access to that we do have access to right now from the multiple product stocks.

- Right. Do you think there is room for a company like you in enterprise software with all the big giants like Salesforce and Oracle?

- Big time. There is so much room for us because you see the biggest problem about small businesses is usually around customer lifetime cycles and the support cost. So our innovation isn't really enterprise software. Our innovation is the distribution. What we've innovated is the distribution. So the main reason why we built Zagace is more of to make enterprise software basic and accessible to all. So the enterprise software already existed, and it will continue to exist, but is it an Oracle thing to make it basic and accessible to all? Definitely not, and that's not their business.

So and then the other thing is that the economics around getting small business owners and solopreneurs are completely different from enterprise customers because from the time they begin to pay from the amount of data that it requires to collect for them to actually find value in those products, so there is room for us. Big time.

- You talked about how you were accepted when you went to Silicon Valley because you're from Kenya, but on the other hand, have you faced any issues of discrimination or being limited in terms of the capital that you like to get because you're a person of color?

- I'd say how I'd look at it is more I felt that, but I haven't felt-- I haven't experienced it directly because I've been fortunate because at the time that most of the people that I got to interact with were persons that looked at me as a person of industry, as a professional in the industry. So it wasn't more of a startup thing, and in as much as the discrimination exists, I didn't experience it because of a controlled network and a controlled group of people that were helping me out. So, yes, it's there, from an aspect of larger rounds, but then I haven't had first-hand customer experience where someone has directly done it to me as a person individually.

- Do you see other people in your shoes in Kenya and maybe beyond in Africa who need financing who can't get it? Or do they have access to capital?

- I think it's a really big problem in Africa, but there you see in terms of corporate, if your structure matches as a corporate, there are many ways to go around some of those things, because I think about it like this: if I have $50 billion that I am to give to somebody in the Bay Area and to give to someone in Nairobi, I definitely have a preference for someone that I know in an environment that I know. So if you look at it from that perspective, I think it isn't more about discrimination, it's about how to structure it because it's more about just going for it.

People tend to work with people that they feel comfortable around and people that they feel comfortable with. So I look at it from that perspective, as a as opposed to an aspect of discrimination because the issue is usually yes, you can say this discrimination, but is there really value or too much of the need for that money? Because the problem becomes in as much as there are so many people who don't have funding, there are also not very good innovative stuff that need accurate a money. Most of it is just stuff that can't pass the statistical, [INAUDIBLE] viable to meet those investment needs. So if you look at it from that perspective, any business or innovation that is financially viable and sustainable over time can have access to funding with proper corporate structuring that can still be [INAUDIBLE] discrimination problems.

- What tech companies are-- American tech companies --have large market shares in Nairobi? In other words, is it Apple? Is it Facebook? Is it Twitter? Do people use Skype? What are the tech products and services that Kenyans use?

- We're talking like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and yeah, I think WhatsApp. So pretty much those are the main ones from an aspect of the largest number of customer ba-- actually Facebook is more of a pointer, in terms of how we grow in the business because of their style of business operation.

- And I want to ask you about microfinance because that's a popular way for Western entrepreneurs to support businesses in developing countries. Do you see that in Kenya much? And what do you think about that?

- Microfinance is a really reliable thing because it creates a personal relationship between the financing and the persons involved, but then the thing about it is that it may be good for small scale, but the impact-- the impact is only from an aspect of getting out of poverty but not big business growth. It's the one for small businesses and individuals from a poverty perspective, and it's really sustainable, but when it comes to big business, I think it's a really unsustainable model because it creates politics in big business and then brings in unnecessary bureaucracy from an aspect of big business operation.

- Mubarak, you mentioned that the economy is not very good in Kenya. Why is that?

- I think it's because of one-- there's a discrepancy between information that we acquired from debt and corruption matter, so what usually happens is that the stories that we read today are information that will take more like three months for you to actually get a clearer picture of what's going on, and that's from an aspect of government information and independently collaborated information because we have constant information being disputed over time.

So the only way you can have information that's constantly reliable is that it takes like three months or something like that. So the economy-- the economy's really bad because of one the debt thing, and then the COVID situation, and then you add to that the corruption, so when you bring in the corruption in the equation, information exchange gets hazy because we cannot tell what up to a certain point when it's undisputable, or indisputable.

- Do you live full time in Nairobi? Or do you split time between Nairobi and Silicon Valley? Where do you-- where do you live most of the time?

- I actually moved full time to Silicon Valley. I only-- I only come to Nairobi once in a while because it's more of I have family and family ties and things like those, so it's more I moved to the Bay Area fully.

- Who are your role models, Mubarak, in terms of tech CEOs and leaders and maybe people in other fields of endeavor? And for instance, Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Do you-- do you look to them?

- I'd say I look to Bill Gates quite a bit from an aspect of competitiveness and from an aspect of focus because he has this ability to look at things and look at them to a level until he gets what he wants. But I think what I borrow mostly-- who I borrow mostly from is Warren Buffett because I think Warren Buffett represents-- he represents a mature American business person that is so neatly organized and thorough and to the point.

- Have you ever met Warren Buffett or been to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting?

- No, but I will one day.

- And what about the rest of your career in your life, Mubarak? You're only 26 years old. What are your aspirations? What do you hope to achieve over the next decade and throughout your lifetime?

- No, I think the most important thing is to figure out a way in which I can make enterprise software basic and accessible to all. That's around the world, just not in Africa. Thanks to statistics and newly acquired information that informs insight on multiple things. So I think for the foreseeable decade, that I think is what I really want to achieve because what we've been able to do is make enterprise software standard, which was something that was really not possible in the past.

- And last question, Mubarak. If you could ask Warren Buffett one question, what would it be?

- I'd say investment, but then yeah, I'd say investments.

- You'd ask him about investment?

- Right. Not actually investment. I'd actually ask him to invest with me.

- Oh, you would ask him to invest. Right. Good one. Love it. All right we're going to have to leave it there. Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace. Thank you so much for joining us, Mubarak.

- Thank you.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: I'd love to begin by talking a bit about the work you've done at Revolution, the Rise of the Rest fund, and this distribution dynamic we've seen play out as a result of COVID, people leaving San Francisco, leaving New York, and if you feel like this is COVID specific or if this is the market coming to the thesis that you've been outlining here for several years.

STEVE CASE: A little bit of both. As you said, we started the Rise of the Rest initiative and Startup America almost a decade ago and said, we need to have a more evenly dispersed innovation economy. We can't just have the successful startups in a few places like Silicon Valley. We need to spread them all around the country. And the data from the venture capital associations over the last few years, about 75% of venture capital has just gone to three states-- California, New York, and Massachusetts.

So we've been on this for a while. And we've long predicted that at some point, there would be a, after a brain drain of talent, people leaving the middle of the country to go the coast because that's where the opportunity was, there'd be a kind of a returning, a boomerang. And we're seeing an acceleration of that because of the pandemic. So maybe that is one of the silver linings.

A lot of people that were in San Francisco, were in New York, some of these major startup cities, did decide to shelter in place. I think initially, they thought they would just do that temporarily. Some of them have decided to stay, whether they be entrepreneurs or venture capitalists. I think that bodes well for the Rise of the Rest.

JULIE HYMAN: How is that distribution going to play out? Because, you know, I'm looking at the map of your footprint of the Rise of the Rest fund and some tour dates that you guys were making. I mean, Miami is on here. That has obviously been a hot destination for people to move to. Nashville has been hot. Dallas has been another place that people have been looking to, Denver. Are we going to get-- are you at all concerned about new kinds of unequal distributions based on the migrations that we're now seeing as a result of the pandemic?

Story continues

STEVE CASE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, right now, if you look at the last couple of decades, in terms of what's happened with the innovation economy in this country, it has overwhelmingly been in three cities. What we're trying to do with the Rise of the Rest is spread that to more, like, 30 cities. And so far, we have visited I guess 44 cities with our Rise of the Rest bus tour. Our Rise of the Rest fund has invested in over 150 companies and 70 cities.

So there's a lot of things happening there. And I think that really is going to be helped and catalyzed by what's happening with this pandemic. So certainly, there are challenges in each of these cities. And it's great to see mayors like the mayor in Miami and other leaders in different cities really saying, this is a moment. Let's seize it. Let's really focus on startups. Just try to be a magnet for the talent. Then we can be a magnet for the capital, and we can have some of the next generation, big, iconic breakthrough companies follow.

We actually just published a week or so ago a new playbook, a Rise of the Rest playbook. You can go to the revolution.com site and click on it. And it's a free guide that really just talks about what's happening in cities like Miami, cities like Tulsa, cities like Denver, and more broadly, in states like Ohio.

There's some amazing things that have been bubbling, really, for a number of years. It's just we're now seeing this acceleration because of the pandemic. And hopefully, that will mean over the next five or 10 years, more of the venture capital will spread out. More of the startups will spread out. And therefore, more of the job creation will spread out.

MYLES UDLAND: And, you know, Steve, related to that, you hear a lot from VCs, who will say things like, you know, a city needs a big exit to kind of be codified as a major place that you want to put a lot of capital. And what we're seeing in public markets today is the SPAC is now so popular, such an easier route for companies to come public. Do you think that will help take a city like Columbus to its first deck of corn exit, right? If that's something that that kind of a hub needs to have more folks like yourself say, hey, I want to look specifically at a hub like that to put a lot of capital to work.

STEVE CASE: Well, some of it, I think, for venture capital just expanding the aperture. There actually have been some breakout multibillion dollar successes in Indianapolis, in Columbus, in Denver, in Provo, Utah. But this has already been happening. We're just now seeing an acceleration. And that's what I think is going to be interesting to watch over the next decade.

I think SPACs do create a great option for companies that have a long-term growth plan, that they really need to tell that story and show how they're going to grow. And the SPACs do seem to be better pricing those growth stories in more of a traditional IPO, where you're more constrained in terms of what you can disclose.

More options for entrepreneurs, more options for companies, more capital going to startups in general is a good thing, which is why I worked on the JOBS Act seven or eight years ago to change some of the rules regarding capital formation. And there's still work to be done. So any innovations such as SPACs I think can be helpful.

BRIAN SOZZI: Steve, you also helped develop Section 230 way back when. Looking at the debate that has evolved since, how would you modernize it?

STEVE CASE: It's a good question. When I was running AOL now almost, I guess, 30 years ago, that was when some of the initial rules of the road of the internet, whether it be e-commerce, whether it should be taxes or how do you keep things safe for kids, but also the 230 rule. At the time, it was different, obviously, because fewer people were on the internet. And even on AOL, it was mostly about posting messages and message boards.

The phenomenon in the last decade in particular, with things like Facebook and the news feed, where there's algorithms that are kind of putting things higher up in the list, that does change some of the dynamics. So I do think it requires a fresh look. Obviously, there's a lot of focus here in Washington now on that. Exactly how it should change, I haven't focused on it enough recently to really know.

But it's fair to say that now that the internet has really arrived and the way these systems are working, particularly social media platforms, is different. And they are playing more of a role in terms of what people are seeing. It's not just serendipitous. Taking a fresh look at 230 does make sense.

BRIAN SOZZI: What would that fresh look like, Steve? What would it look like to the bottom line of big tech?

STEVE CASE: Well, it's hard to say. I think it's a sensitive issue. There's a lot of nuance to it. So I think you have to really kind of dig in and understand what sort of the-- you're trying to deal with. How do you solve it in a way that has positive benefits for the broader startup ecosystem? Obviously, some of these big, powerful companies, whether it be Facebook or Google or others, are so strong, it's hard for startups to really compete with them.

So anything that can level the playing field and allow more startups to do things that are more disruptive, including challenging incumbents, not just in legacy industries, but also some of the Silicon Valley giants I think would be a good thing. 230 is only a small part of that discussion, but I think it could be an important part.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, obviously, antitrust and lots of other stuff going to be part of the discussion also. Steve, I do want to switch gears and talk to you about that phenomenon that Myles was talking about at the top of the show that we've been watching closely, which is the heavy short interest in a lot of shares that are now seeing the sort of counter bull raid, for lack of a better term.

And there's also been talk with SPACs, with hot IPOs, with certain stocks that have just been going to the moon, and a lot of parallels being drawn to 1999, a period that you are very familiar with. And so, I'm curious, do you think we are at another one of those moments, which are always hard to call? But what are you seeing in here that maybe gives you pause in this market or not?

STEVE CASE: Well, I think it is a little different. The 1999 obviously was the internet was just coming of age. It was sort of this phenomenon. Any company with dot com in their name, people were interested in investing in. Many companies went public that really had little or no revenue, and in some cases, didn't even know what their business model was going to be. So it really was really a pure concept dynamic.

That's not what we're seeing today with IPOs or even with SPACs. There's much more granularity in terms of the growth trajectories of these businesses. We've involved-- you know, Revolution Growth, which is sort of the flagship fund at Revolution, has been involved last year. DraftKings went public quite successfully via SPAC. Now it's trading at a $20 billion plus valuation. More recently, a couple of weeks ago, we announced the transaction. Still have a couple of months before we'll close with Talkspace and the telehealth base also via SPAC.

So we do think it's a useful mechanism for companies that need access to capital and want to tell their story with more transparency that they're able to do on the IPO side. Is the market fully valued? Time will tell. There are some stocks that maybe are a little high, but there are also a lot of stocks that have missed because a lot of the momentum has been for those giants, the so-called FAANG stocks.

We also need to focus not just on the companies that exist today that are going public or are public, but this next generation of companies, which is why backing startups everywhere, going back to the discussion about the Rise of the Rest, is really, really so important.

JULIE HYMAN: And so, let's talk about that for a moment, the private market. Are you finding good value on that side? Are you finding ample opportunity? Are you finding it at prices that you think are attractive right now?

STEVE CASE: Well, we're careful. We have three funds at Revolution that, you know, as I said, Revolution Growth is the main one. About 2/3 of our assets under management. We also have Revolution Ventures, which has been quite significant. It had a lot of momentum. And then, more recently, this Rise of the Rest in seed fund.

We're being careful, particularly on the later stage growth investments. We're being pretty disciplined. We make three or four investments typically in a year. Some make 15 or 20. And some of that is because we want to make sure we're really backing the right entrepreneurs and have the time to help them scale those companies. But also, in some cases, we have thought valuations were on the high side. So we've been careful in terms of pulling the trigger, if you will, on making new commitments.

MYLES UDLAND: And, you know, Steve, just to wrap up, finally, we started the conversation with kind of how COVID changed the geographic distribution perhaps of where people are looking. I'm curious if there's new areas of the market, particularly in healthcare, that folks are more interested in, given the way that, you know, the pandemic certainly confronted us with a lot of shortcomings within that part of the system. And Talkspace, we talked to them a couple of weeks ago-- certainly a part of that. But I'm curious if there's other opportunities there that you guys are seeing.

STEVE CASE: Absolutely. We also have another company-- Revolution Growth-backed Tempus in Chicago has done some amazing things using big data to try to better diagnose initially cancer, but they also focused on COVID. CLEAR, a company we also backed at Revolution Growth, initially focused on kind of an airport fast pass, but also launched in this past year a health pass. Actually powered the bubble that the Hockey League used and NHL used in Canada a few months ago, and now expanding that with a lot of corporations embracing the health pass.

So I do think-- because I think the pandemic was a reminder how important health is in terms of everyday life and how some of the delivery systems aren't very effective. So creating better care, better outcomes, more affordability, kind of a greater convenience, I think people are on it. And there will be a lot of momentum in that sector over the next decade. We're already seeing it. We expect that to accelerate.

Also, by the way, it ties in with the Rise of the Rest because some of the most important healthcare organizations, like M.D. Anderson in Texas or Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio or the big health plans like United in Minneapolis, a lot of health plans in Nashville. I think as healthcare becomes more important, and we're entering this third wave of the internet, these rising cities will become more important as well. So that's why I'm so optimistic about the future.

BRIAN SOZZI: Steve, we've got some new data out this morning. Definitely, I want to get your thoughts on it. From the Americans for Tax Fairness, they came out and noted that the wealth of America's billionaires increased $1.1 trillion through the first 10 months of the pandemic, which really seems out of whack. It really does. What would you like to see from the body administration to close that wealth gap between the haves and have-nots?

STEVE CASE: Now I've been very concerned about this and talked about it over the years. And some of that ties in with the work we're doing, trying to back startups to do create jobs and good-paying jobs, not just in those companies, but for every startup job, there are about five other jobs in the community in housing and services and so forth.

And in terms of your specific question, when he was running for office last summer, now President Biden put this Build Back Better plan in place that did deal with income inequality and also did deal with this issue of, how do you make sure we don't have the innovation haves and have-nots, where some people, but not that many, are really benefiting from this innovation economy? A lot of people are being left behind by it. And that included trying to get more capital to more entrepreneurs in more cities, to back more startups and create more jobs, as well as, more recently, the legislation they introduced, which included a $15 minimum wage.

So I think the Biden administration's on it. They recognize that we continue to be the leader of the pack, the most innovative entrepreneurial nation in the world. But it hasn't been particularly inclusive. And we need to have a kind of reboot capitalism and reboot innovation and entrepreneurship so it brings everybody along. Everybody gets the benefits, and everybody has an opportunity to participate in the innovation economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/steve-case-innovation-economy-2021-170436051.html?.tsrc=rss,"['300206.SHE', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'DKNG.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'TWTR.US', 'XLK.US']",['INNOVATION ECONOMY'],"{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.131}"

At the time, it was different, obviously, because fewer people were on the internet. And even on AOL, it was mostly about posting messages and message boards.

The phenomenon in the last decade in particular, with things like Facebook and the news feed, where there's algorithms that are kind of putting things higher up in the list, that does change some of the dynamics. So I do think it requires a fresh look. Obviously, there's a lot of focus here in Washington now on that. Exactly how it should change, I haven't focused on it enough recently to really know.

But it's fair to say that now that the internet has really arrived and the way these systems are working, particularly social media platforms, is different. And they are playing more of a role in terms of what people are seeing. It's not just serendipitous. Taking a fresh look at 230 does make sense.

BRIAN SOZZI: What would that fresh look like, Steve? What would it look like to the bottom line of big tech?

STEVE CASE: Well, it's hard to say. I think it's a sensitive issue. There's a lot of nuance to it. So I think you have to really kind of dig in and understand what sort of the-- you're trying to deal with. How do you solve it in a way that has positive benefits for the broader startup ecosystem? Obviously, some of these big, powerful companies, whether it be Facebook or Google or others, are so strong, it's hard for startups to really compete with them.

So anything that can level the playing field and allow more startups to do things that are more disruptive, including challenging incumbents, not just in legacy industries, but also some of the Silicon Valley giants I think would be a good thing. 230 is only a small part of that discussion, but I think it could be an important part.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, obviously, antitrust and lots of other stuff going to be part of the discussion also. Steve, I do want to switch gears and talk to you about that phenomenon that Myles was talking about at the top of the show that we've been watching closely, which is the heavy short interest in a lot of shares that are now seeing the sort of counter bull raid, for lack of a better term.

And there's also been talk with SPACs, with hot IPOs, with certain stocks that have just been going to the moon, and a lot of parallels being drawn to 1999, a period that you are very familiar with. And so, I'm curious, do you think we are at another one of those moments, which are always hard to call? But what are you seeing in here that maybe gives you pause in this market or not?

STEVE CASE: Well, I think it is a little different. The 1999 obviously was the internet was just coming of age. It was sort of this phenomenon. Any company with dot com in their name, people were interested in investing in. Many companies went public that really had little or no revenue, and in some cases, didn't even know what their business model was going to be. So it really was really a pure concept dynamic.

That's not what we're seeing today with IPOs or even with SPACs. There's much more granularity in terms of the growth trajectories of these businesses. We've involved-- you know, Revolution Growth, which is sort of the flagship fund at Revolution, has been involved last year. DraftKings went public quite successfully via SPAC. Now it's trading at a $20 billion plus valuation. More recently, a couple of weeks ago, we announced the transaction. Still have a couple of months before we'll close with Talkspace and the telehealth base also via SPAC.

So we do think it's a useful mechanism for companies that need access to capital and want to tell their story with more transparency that they're able to do on the IPO side. Is the market fully valued? Time will tell. There are some stocks that maybe are a little high, but there are also a lot of stocks that have missed because a lot of the momentum has been for those giants, the so-called FAANG stocks.

We also need to focus not just on the companies that exist today that are going public or are public, but this next generation of companies, which is why backing startups everywhere, going back to the discussion about the Rise of the Rest, is really, really so important.

JULIE HYMAN: And so, let's talk about that for a moment, the private market. Are you finding good value on that side? Are you finding ample opportunity? Are you finding it at prices that you think are attractive right now?

STEVE CASE: Well, we're careful. We have three funds at Revolution that, you know, as I said, Revolution Growth is the main one. About 2/3 of our assets under management. We also have Revolution Ventures, which has been quite significant. It had a lot of momentum. And then, more recently, this Rise of the Rest in seed fund.

We're being careful, particularly on the later stage growth investments. We're being pretty disciplined. We make three or four investments typically in a year. Some make 15 or 20. And some of that is because we want to make sure we're really backing the right entrepreneurs and have the time to help them scale those companies. But also, in some cases, we have thought valuations were on the high side. So we've been careful in terms of pulling the trigger, if you will, on making new commitments.

MYLES UDLAND: And, you know, Steve, just to wrap up, finally, we started the conversation with kind of how COVID changed the geographic distribution perhaps of where people are looking. I'm curious if there's new areas of the market, particularly in healthcare, that folks are more interested in, given the way that, you know, the pandemic certainly confronted us with a lot of shortcomings within that part of the system. And Talkspace, we talked to them a couple of weeks ago-- certainly a part of that. But I'm curious if there's other opportunities there that you guys are seeing.

STEVE CASE: Absolutely. We also have another company-- Revolution Growth-backed Tempus in Chicago has done some amazing things using big data to try to better diagnose initially cancer, but they also focused on COVID. CLEAR, a company we also backed at Revolution Growth, initially focused on kind of an airport fast pass, but also launched in this past year a health pass. Actually powered the bubble that the Hockey League used and NHL used in Canada a few months ago, and now expanding that with a lot of corporations embracing the health pass.

So I do think-- because I think the pandemic was a reminder how important health is in terms of everyday life and how some of the delivery systems aren't very effective. So creating better care, better outcomes, more affordability, kind of a greater convenience, I think people are on it. And there will be a lot of momentum in that sector over the next decade. We're already seeing it. We expect that to accelerate.

Also, by the way, it ties in with the Rise of the Rest because some of the most important healthcare organizations, like M.D. Anderson in Texas or Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio or the big health plans like United in Minneapolis, a lot of health plans in Nashville. I think as healthcare becomes more important, and we're entering this third wave of the internet, these rising cities will become more important as well. So that's why I'm so optimistic about the future.

BRIAN SOZZI: Steve, we've got some new data out this morning. Definitely, I want to get your thoughts on it. From the Americans for Tax Fairness, they came out and noted that the wealth of America's billionaires increased $1.1 trillion through the first 10 months of the pandemic, which really seems out of whack. It really does. What would you like to see from the body administration to close that wealth gap between the haves and have-nots?

STEVE CASE: Now I've been very concerned about this and talked about it over the years. And some of that ties in with the work we're doing, trying to back startups to do create jobs and good-paying jobs, not just in those companies, but for every startup job, there are about five other jobs in the community in housing and services and so forth.

And in terms of your specific question, when he was running for office last summer, now President Biden put this Build Back Better plan in place that did deal with income inequality and also did deal with this issue of, how do you make sure we don't have the innovation haves and have-nots, where some people, but not that many, are really benefiting from this innovation economy? A lot of people are being left behind by it. And that included trying to get more capital to more entrepreneurs in more cities, to back more startups and create more jobs, as well as, more recently, the legislation they introduced, which included a $15 minimum wage.

So I think the Biden administration's on it. They recognize that we continue to be the leader of the pack, the most innovative entrepreneurial nation in the world. But it hasn't been particularly inclusive. And we need to have a kind of reboot capitalism and reboot innovation and entrepreneurship so it brings everybody along. Everybody gets the benefits, and everybody has an opportunity to participate in the innovation economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/steve-case-innovation-economy-2021-170436051.html,"['300206.SHE', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'DKNG.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'TWTR.US', 'XLK.US']",['INNOVATION ECONOMY'],"{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.131}"

The Chinese Internet behemoth lost 6.3% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization below $890 billion. Traders took profit after Monday’s 11% rally, which was Tencent’s biggest in almost a decade. Adding to the caution were comments by an adviser to China’s central bank at a conference, reported by local media, indicating that excessive liquidity was creating asset bubbles.

Thousands of bullish Tencent options lost almost all their value, after some surged as much as 118,300% on Monday. The frenzy in derivatives trading pushed the cost of one-month Tencent options to the highest since March 2014 relative to those tracking the Hong Kong benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The prospect that China will tighten funding conditions threatens to derail Tencent’s stock rally, which has been underpinned by a relentless flow of capital from the mainland. Onshore funds have purchased a record amount of Hong Kong shares this month, with about a quarter of that targeting Tencent. As more than a billion people use its WeChat social-media platform, Tencent is ubiquitous to Chinese investors who have no access to Hong Kong shares of rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. through the trading links.

Tencent was the most recent mega-cap company to benefit from investor enthusiasm for the tech sector, with its looming milestone a marker for the euphoria sweeping the stocks globally. Before Tuesday, the stock had added $251 billion in January alone -- by far the biggest creation of shareholder wealth worldwide. Warnings are rising that easy monetary policy is fueling bubbles in global equities, especially in the U.S., where gains have been led by the Nasdaq.

As investors seek cheaper alternatives, they’ve been piling into Hong Kong equities. That’s helped make the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks in the past month.

Story continues

While Tencent has long been an investor favorite in Asia, returning more than 100,000% since its 2004 initial public offering as of Monday, there are other risks to the rally.

In 2018, a government crackdown on China’s online gaming industry squeezed Tencent’s most profitable business, which at the time accounted for about 40% of its revenue. Coupled with a slowing Chinese economy and a weakening yuan, Beijing’s nine-month halt on approvals for new games contributed to a 22% slump in the shares.

A campaign against monopolistic practices since late last year has targeted many of the industries in which Tencent and rival Alibaba operate, including the online payments industry. But while increasing regulatory risk has left Alibaba’s shares about 18% lower than their October peak, Tencent has closed at a record in seven of the past nine sessions.

Tencent would be the second Chinese firm to join the trillion-dollar club after PetroChina Co., which was briefly worth more than that in late 2007 before collapsing in value. U.S. tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also worth more than $1 trillion each, as is Saudi Arabian Oil Co.

Tencent was founded in 1998 by four college classmates and a friend from Shenzhen who devised a Chinese version of the instant messaging service ICQ. Led by “Pony” Ma Huateng -- ma is Chinese for “horse” -- the company’s chat software became the primary communication tool for a generation of young Chinese.

Tencent’s surge has outpaced all but the most bullish analysts’ forecasts. The stock’s closing level of HK$766.50 on Monday was almost 10% higher than the consensus 12-month price target compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 2014.

We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether shares of Jumia Technologies AG - ADR (NASDAQ: JMIA) will reach $100 by 2022.

Jumia Stock Forecast

Jumia Technologies is a pan-African e-commerce platform that connects sellers with consumers. It includes a logistics service for shipping and delivering packages from sellers to consumers. The company also has a payment service for transactions among participants in selected markets.

Jumia directly provides more than 5,000 jobs and many more through the sellers and logistics partnerships.

In a case for future growth, research by Jumia suggests less than 1% e-commerce penetration in Africa versus 12% in the U.S. and 20% in China.

Jumia's stock was trading as low as $2.15 in early 2020 and was valued at a few hundred million dollars. After an explosion of growth amid the pandemic, Jumia now trades at around $59 with a market cap of $4.62 billion dollars.

It can be said Jumia seeks to become the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) of Africa, as the firm attempts to achieve market penetration within Africa similar to that of the FAANG giant.

Other e-commerce firms to consider, and who Jumia may choose to model themselves after amid the firm’s rise, include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR, Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP), Wayfair Inc (NYSE: W) and Overstock.com Inc (NASDAQ: OSTK).

Our study revealed 74% of Benzinga traders and investors think Jumia will reach $100 per share by the end of next year.

Traders and investors who participated in our study believe shares of Jumia will continue to grow off an increased desire to receive goods via e-commerce delivery services across the African continent, as well as a shared belief that Jumia will eventually be viewed as a tech company first and foremost, and an e-commerce service provider second.

278,2021-01-22T22:21:13+00:00,Parler’s New Partner Has Ties to the Russian Government,"(Bloomberg) -- Parler LLC, the social media app popular with Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists, is attempting to get back online with the help of a Russian company whose clients include an internet service provider to Russian intelligence, raising concerns about the conservative social forum’s security if it ever formally returns.

U.S-based Parler began working with DDoS-Guard on Jan. 17 after getting cut off from Amazon Web Services. The Russian company offers its customers cybersecurity services and web hosting, which includes reserving website names, collecting platform data and piecing it together to present on the internet.

Publicly available internet information shows Parler’s data flows through a DDoS-Guard server registered to an address in Belize, which cybersecurity experts believe is a tool to protect the true identity and location of Parler’s web host. The Russian company declined to say what services it’s offering Parler.

Nevertheless, cybersecurity researchers said Parler’s relationship with DDoS-Guard -- which has fulfilled contracts with several government entities including the state-owned telecommunications company TransTeleCom Co ZAO -- raises concerns that its millions of users could be susceptible to surveillance if the platform returns online. Russian telecommunications companies play an essential role in the government’s digital surveillance program, SORM, which requires service providers and carriers to install backdoors to state intelligence.

“Most people would be afraid of being fronted by Russians, but Parler actually signed up for it,” said Justin Shattuck, senior security solutions engineer at Resilience Cyber Insurance Solutions. “It’s a little crazy.”

A data analysis indicates that Parler is the only American company -- aside from some phishing and crypto scam pages -- entrusting DDoS-Guard to host or secure any portion of its platform, Shattuck said.

Mike Convertino, the former chief information security officer at F5 Networks, CrowdStrike Inc. and Twitter Inc., said that if bad actors got access to Parler’s unencrypted data, they could alert, insert or delete content on the platform.

“They could insert anything they want -- cram words in the Parler CEO’s mouth or Sean Hannity’s,” said Convertino, now the chief security officer at Resilience Cyber Insurance Solutions. “You could also build a massive compendium of our citizens, or at least those who follow Trump. To see a conservative entity go into the waiting arms of a Russian hoster is out of some dystopian dream.”

Parler didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment. The app became a popular alternative for supporters of Donald Trump after Twitter and Facebook cracked down on false claims by the former U.S. president and his followers. It was then taken offline on Jan. 11 after Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its web hosting, determining that the social media site had failed to moderate content which contributed to rioting at the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6.

On Thursday, a federal judge in Seattle refused Parler’s request to order Amazon to immediately restore hosting.

A DDoS-Guard spokesman said Parler doesn’t use its hosting service but wouldn’t say exactly what services it provides. “As far as we know, the social network did not violate any laws or policies in the past.” DDoS-Guard didn’t comment on its relationship with Russian intelligence or TransTeleCom Co ZAO.

TransTeleCom, among DDoS Guard’s other clients, is a state-owned telecommunications company that in turn provides internet services to a Russian intelligence agency. DDoS-Guard has also worked with the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sberbank Insurance -- majority owned by the Russian central bank -- and a regional digital development and communications committee along the Russia-Ukraine border, according to contracts and filings reviewed by Bloomberg News.

When asked about Parler’s relationship with DDoS Guard, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government isn’t familiar with the company.

“Of course we don’t know about this company so I can’t tell you anything,” he said. “Undoubtedly there are many competitive firms in Russia’s IT sphere and even more in cyber-security area.”

U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, called on Jan. 21 for the FBI to investigate Parler’s role in the Capitol insurrection, as well as the company’s finances and ties to Russia “given the company has re-emerged on a Russian hosting service.”

As long as Parler remains in its state of internet purgatory -- the homepage currently explains its technical difficulties but little more -- the platform’s user data isn’t at risk. The concerns only become a reality if Parler returns to form on its desktop and mobile apps.

Despite its struggles, Chief Executive Officer John Matze said on the website that the platform’s “return is inevitable.”

But even its relationship with DDoS-Guard remains in doubt. On Thursday, the cybersecurity blog KrebsOnSecurity reported that DDoS-Guard may lose a massive volume of server addresses in Belize. This could either prompt DDoS Guard to find a server closer to home, or force Parler to find yet another partner.

DDoS-Guard is run by two Russians, Evgenii Marchenko and Dmitry Sabitov, and since 2017, it has offered its services to TransTeleCom. The telecom provides services to the Federal Security Service, known as FSB, the successor to the Soviet Union’s KGB, according to contracts and public records reviewed by Bloomberg News. The intelligence agency has been sanctioned and indicted by the U.S. for waging cyber-attacks against corporate and government networks, according to the U.S. Treasury and Justice departments.

The FSB’s efforts to spy on telecommunications systems is rather explicit. The Russian government requires telecommunications providers to install the FSB’s hardware so it can conduct surveillance on its population, including monitoring phone calls, web activity and email communications, according to the Russian Ministry of Communications and critics of the program.

“The potential worry is for Parler communications to get wrapped up in SORM (Russian intelligence) requirements for Russian access,” said Joe Slowik, senior security researcher at the cybersecurity firm DomainTools.

Parler’s decision to hire DDoS-Guard came six weeks after the U.S. government discovered a sprawling cyber-attack that breached government agencies and private companies. U.S. intelligence and the FBI have said that Russia was likely behind the attack, which utilized several methods including inserting malicious code in updates for software from Texas-based SolarWinds Corp. Cybersecurity researchers have found similarities in the techniques used in the recent hacking campaign, which was first disclosed last month, to tools used in the past by Russia’s FSB.

As its name suggests, DDoS-Guard provides protection against what are known as distributed denial of service attacks, or DDoS for short, in which a massive amount of junk traffic is directed at a server or network to disrupt service. Essential to DDoS protection service are filters used to scrub user data for malicious traffic when it arrives at the host server.

As these data packets speed through the filters, service providers may receive unencrypted access to review the incoming traffic -- a place where an impostor could lurk to intercept data, according to Convertino.

Access to such unencrypted data could allow adversaries to collect information about Parler’s user base, which accounts for a chunk of former Trump’s base of supporters, said Gene Yoo, chief executive officer at the cyber intelligence firm Resecurity.

“Foreign intelligence may collect unique data using DDoS-Guard to filter Parler’s traffic, which would allow them to enumerate all of Trump’s fans and far-right supporters,” Yoo said. “Having this kind of data is a priceless asset for any foreign intelligence agency, which we know has already targeted Trump’s base with digital influence campaigns.”

279,2021-01-22T20:51:22+00:00,Canoo’s Eccentricities Are Both a Blessing and a Curse,"Though electric vehicles (EVs) have been stealing headlines lately, most of the sentiment has arguably focused on sector king Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). On the surface, that doesn’t bode particularly well for EV upstarts like Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV). Then again, competition is always good, driving more innovation and delivering lower prices for the consumer. So, is GOEV stock a buy for your portfolio? A Canoo MPDV being loaded with small shipping containers

Source: Canoo media

It’s not a clear-cut answer, as I hope to explain. From the immediate collective emotional state, GOEV stock certainly benefits from compelling tailwinds. First and foremost, it’s official: Joe Biden is the 46th President of the United States.

As you know, Biden has been hammering environmental causes throughout his campaign. With Democrats controlling Congress, he’ll be sure to aggressively push through climate-related issues as he’s already done. Frankly, that’s a huge catalyst for GOEV stock and clean-energy-related companies.

Second, Canoo isn’t just a “linear” competitor to Tesla. Indeed, the upstart rival has brought innovative platforms and thinking to the game. For starters, its “skateboard” architecture that allows myriad vehicle designs under a single base frame not only saves costs, but it also attracted the attention of automakers like Hyundai and Kia.

One of the key characteristics of this skateboard format is that it allows manufacturers to adapt to shifting consumer trends quickly. Given that expectations regarding consumer experiences have never been higher, this architectural innovation could potentially swing GOEV stock higher.

Also, Canoo is deploying a subscription model for its consumer EV. Having such a model would be incredibly convenient for consumers. Theoretically, it will also help transition prospective buyers or those on the fence into EVs from combustion cars. That’s the kind of smart thinking that I like to see from startups looking to disrupt a deeply ingrained industry.

Story continues

Question Marks Also Hang Over GOEV Stock

Nevertheless, like any endeavor, Canoo has some pros and cons. Right off the top, the design element is going to be controversial. Previously, I described the Canoo EV as a toaster on wheels. Sure, some people will like the look. At scale, I’m beginning to have my doubts.

That’s because automobiles naturally go through an evolution of design over many years. You might even say that the overriding automotive design motif of a set time described the culture of that period. The problem with Canoo’s drivable toaster is that it’s not design evolution but regression.

Will consumers go for it? Maybe. But it’s something to keep in mind before getting too heavily involved with GOEV stock.

More critically, as I study the nuances of electrification of transportation, EV upstarts may have trouble attracting consumers on the reasonable end of the income range. For instance, when people talk about charging at home, they almost always mean that they already installed a level 2 charging system (240 volts) in their garage. Charging an EV with a standard 120V system will take several days.

You can probably get an electrician to do the conversion for around $1,000 or so. But the bigger issue is that homeownership rates for millennials have lagged that of prior generations. So, much of Canoo’s key demographic probably won’t be able to enjoy at-home charging (because they live in restrictive apartments or condominiums).

Therefore, public charging is something that many young Canoo buyers must use. That leads to other inconveniences, because public charging can be confusing and frustrating, especially for non-Tesla drivers. Further, fast charging may improve the inconvenient aspect, but it’s not great for the battery to fast charge all the time.

While these headwinds may not sound like a big deal, add them up over time, and they can drag on customers.

Canoo’s Subscription Risk?

And that brings me to my final concern about GOEV stock, the underlying subscription service. Typically, if you bought an EV from a “standard” automaker, you’re stuck with the vehicle. Essentially, a normal automotive business model forces petrol heads to learn to love EVs.

But with Canoo’s subscription service that requires only a minimum one-month term, why, if you have a problem with the zero-emissions lifestyle, you can return that puppy. You’re just out one car payment — no biggie!

Thus, GOEV stock may have a pre-recovery Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) risk. Before Best Buy transitioned the company to be more relevant to the consumer, it was treated as a showroom floor for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). If that happens to Canoo, and it becomes a try-before-you-buy-something-else platform, it will do a service to EVs, perhaps, but not for itself.

And bringing it back full circle, that’s the risk of having an uninspiring design. Combined with a subscription model, you’re inviting customers with ulterior motives.

However, I don’t want to get too negative. Again, Canoo’s skateboard architecture could be the real deal. Certainly Hyundai thinks so, and that’s not a fly-by-night operation.

Bottom line, I think there’s enough here for speculators. But if you’re a conservative investor, you may want to wait for GOEV stock to lose some of its choppiness and gain some established composure before moving in.

Since going public in mid-December 2020, WISH stock has returned over 10% and is currently hovering at $26. The logo and information for the Wish (WISH) mobile app are displayed on a smartphone.

Wish’s platform is based on a personalized and visual browsing experience. One could compare it to how one browses around in a physical store. Therefore, the company has been able to generate significant buzz around its platform and app.

The Wish app has become one of the most downloaded global shopping apps in the past several years. Currently, the company has more than 100 million monthly active users as well as over 500,000 merchants around the world.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Today’s article discusses what investors can expect from WISH stock in the early part of the year. If you are not yet a shareholder, you could consider starting a position in WISH shares, especially if declines toward $22.50 or lower. As it is still early days for the group, the road ahead could be choppy. However, I expect the shares to create significant shareholder value in the coming quarters.

Recent Earnings

Global e-retail sales hit $3.53 trillion in 2019. Then came the exponential growth in 2020. Consumers were already drifting towards online shopping before the coronavirus pandemic became the dominant force in our lives. Last year, the move to e-commerce has gained further momentum, as many retailers have been temporarily closed all over the world.

7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day

Meanwhile, investors are looking for the next Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) to bet their fortunes on. Therefore, a recent IPO like WISH stock gets significant headlines.

The company released Q3 earnings in mid-December and painted a mixed financial picture. Revenue was $606 million and increased by 33% YoY. Net loss was $99 million compared to a loss of $134 million a year ago.

Story continues

When looking at the metrics for the first nine months of 2020, analysts were concerned to see a net loss of $176 million. A year ago, it had been a net loss of $5 million in the same period. Put another way, despite the growth, ContextLogic’s profitability metrics are headed in the wrong direction.

CEO Peter Szulczewski said, “Based on data, we will both double down and pull back on various initiatives as we continually pursue better performance and results. We have made great progress to date, but we are still in the very early days of our journey and are excited for what lies ahead.”

Despite the growth in revenue, the stock is richly valued. It currently has a market capitalization of about $15 billion. Although the company potentially has a lot of room to run, the short-term moves in the share price may not necessarily be smooth sailing.

Furthermore, there are question marks around the quality of products sold on the platform. By selling discounted goods, ContextLogic has definitely created a niche for itself. However, the lower-quality has also created customer complaints. The issue of quality may create headwinds for WISH stock.

The Bottom Line in WISH Stock

The Street’s interest in e-commerce stocks is likely to continue in the new year. The “stay-at-home, work-from-home” trend of last year has contributed to the growth of online shopping worldwide. As a result, e-commerce apps have become among the most popular apps downloaded on smartphones.

The Street also has a big appetite for new offerings. However, it is important to remember that WISH stock does not yet have a long trading history. Also, the company is still unprofitable. As I find WISH stock frothy at these levels, I’d wait to invest until the next earnings statement is released.

Therefore, if you have a two- to three- year horizon, you could consider investing in the shares if WISH stock declines toward $22.50 or even lower. Meanwhile, in the long-run, the company could also find itself a takeover candidate.

Investors who are not yet ready to commit capital into WISH stock could also consider investing in an exchange traded fund (ETF) focusing on e-commerce. Examples include the Amplify Online Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:IBUY), the EmergingMarkets Internet & Ecommerce ETF (NYSEARCA:EMQQ), the Global X E-Commerce ETF (NASDAQ:EBIZ), the ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:ONLN).

Similarly, those market participants who are interested in participating in the growth of newly listed companies may consider the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX), the Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO), or the First Trust IPOX Europe Equity Opportunities ETF (NASDAQ:FPXE).

281,2021-01-22T14:42:07+00:00,Intel Tumbles After New CEO Recommits to Chip Manufacturing,"(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares tumbled after the incoming chief executive officer pledged to regain the company’s lead in chip manufacturing, countering growing calls from some investors to shed that part of its business.

“I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally,” Pat Gelsinger said on a conference call to discuss financial results. “At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it’s likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products.”

He plans to provide more details after officially taking over the CEO role Feb. 15, however Gelsinger was clear that Intel is sticking with its once-mighty manufacturing operation.

“We’re not just interested in closing gaps,” he told analysts on a conference call Thursday. “We’re interested in resuming that position as the unquestioned leader in process technology.”

Keeping production in-house may be bad for Intel because its manufacturing technology has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for many of Intel’s rivals. If the U.S. company can’t catch up, its products will become less competitive and it could lose sales and market share.

Intel shares fell 5.7%% at 9:36 a.m. in New York on Friday. They have declined about 6% over the last 12 months compared with a 16% increase in the S&P 500.

Activist Dan Loeb has suggested the company consider spinning off its manufacturing business. Other investors have been waiting to see if Intel will outsource more production.

“Where investors are going to be disappointed is that some were expecting some sort of larger announcement of a strategic partnership with TSMC,” said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Logan Purk.

TSMC recently announced capital spending of as much as $28 billion for 2021 to maintain its lead. Purk said Intel would have to increase its own spending massively to try to catch the Asian company.

TSMC dropped 3.6%, the most since March 23. Shares of some Intel suppliers also dropped, with Screen Holdings Co. down 3.7% and Tokyo Electron Ltd. declined 1.6%.

Gelsinger is taking the reins of a company in the midst of its worst crisis in at least a decade. It has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years, dominating the $400 billion industry by making the best designs in its own cutting-edge factories. Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold plants and tapped other firms to make the components. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operations and created better semiconductors.

That strategy has crumbled in recent years as Intel struggled to introduce new production techniques on time. It is now lagging behind TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., which make chips for Intel competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and big Intel customers including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.

AMD shares rallied in extended trading while Gelsinger discussed his goal of improving Intel’s in-house manufacturing.

Intel’s quarterly results, released before the market closed on Thursday, initially sent the shares higher. A hacker accessed sensitive information from Intel’s website, prompting the company to report the numbers earlier than planned.

Revenue in the period ending in March will be about $17.5 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said. This excludes the memory chip division Intel is selling. Analysts were looking for $16.2 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Intel sees strong demand for laptops through the first half of the year, Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview. Earnings in the second part of the year will partly depend on whether corporations increase spending on new hardware, he added.

“The question is will we see support from enterprise,” he said. “They’ve been very quiet.”

Intel’s personal computer chip division had revenue of $10.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts expected $9.72 billion. Its higher-margin data center unit generated sales of $6.1 billion. Wall Street was looking for $5.37 billion.

In Intel’s data center business, revenue from cloud service providers fell 15% from a year earlier. Enterprise and government sales slumped 25%. Volumes and average selling prices declined. Owners of large data centers are working their way through unused stockpiles of chips.

In its PC business, Intel reported a 30% surge in laptop chip sales, even as average selling prices declined 15%.

Fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, was $1.52 a share on $20 billion of revenue, down 1% from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated $1.11 a share on revenue of $17.5 billion.

Intel’s gross margin, the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of production, was 56.8%. This is a key indicator of the strength of its manufacturing and product pricing. Intel has historically delivered margins of about 60%.

Shares of the Tide laundry detergent and Gillette shave care owner popped nearly 2% on Wednesday followed another blowout quarter and upbeat outlook, both powered by changing consumer habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company saw organic sales growth in all business segments, paced by a 12% gain in the fabric care business as households do more dish and surface cleaning seeing as they are at home 24/7.

“We're building on strong momentum that we built over the last number of years. And that's continuing through the COVID environment,” P&G Vice Chairman and CFO Jon Moeller told Yahoo Finance.

Here’s how P&G performed compared to Wall Street estimates for its second fiscal quarter.

Net Sales: $19.7 billion vs. estimates for $19.23 billion Core Diluted EPS: $1.64 vs. estimates for $1.51 a share FY21 Outlook: Organic sales growth of +5% to +6% and core EPS growth of +8% to +10%

Previous Organic Sales Growth Outlook: +4% to +5% Previous Core EPS Growth Outlook: +5% to +8%

What’s more, P&G raised its full-fiscal year sales and profit outlooks, and said it will repurchase $10 billion in stock. Previously, the company planned to buy back $7 billion to $9 billion in stock in its fiscal year, but Moeller says P&G has gained added confidence in the direction of the business.

The main question Wall Street has right now on consumer staples is how they will, as the industry jargon goes, “comp the comp” in the second half of 2021. In other words, can consumer staples still show strong sales and profit gains versus a year ago at the height of the pandemic as people worldwide get back to some form of new normal after inoculation. That return to normal could mean fewer purchases of a range of consumer staples from frozen food to laundry detergent and a related growth slowdown at consumer staples.

P&G’s Moeller is well aware of the concerns on the Street, but remains confident the business is in a new steady state.

288,2021-01-20T14:19:00+00:00,"P&amp;G raises full-fiscal year sales and profit outlooks, 'building on strong momentum' amid COVID-19","If the approaching earnings season for consumer staple companies looks anything like earnings day for Procter & Gamble (PG), then many stocks in the sector could get one more leg higher.

Shares of the Tide laundry detergent and Gillette shave care owner popped nearly 2% on Wednesday followed another blowout quarter and upbeat outlook, both powered by changing consumer habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company saw organic sales growth in all business segments, paced by a 12% gain in the fabric care business as households do more dish and surface cleaning seeing as they are at home 24/7.

“We're building on strong momentum that we built over the last number of years. And that's continuing through the COVID environment,” P&G Vice Chairman and CFO Jon Moeller told Yahoo Finance.

Here’s how P&G performed compared to Wall Street estimates for its second fiscal quarter.

Net Sales: $19.7 billion vs. estimates for $19.23 billion Core Diluted EPS: $1.64 vs. estimates for $1.51 a share FY21 Outlook: Organic sales growth of +5% to +6% and core EPS growth of +8% to +10%

Previous Organic Sales Growth Outlook: +4% to +5% Previous Core EPS Growth Outlook: +5% to +8%

What’s more, P&G raised its full-fiscal year sales and profit outlooks, and said it will repurchase $10 billion in stock. Previously, the company planned to buy back $7 billion to $9 billion in stock in its fiscal year, but Moeller says P&G has gained added confidence in the direction of the business.

The main question Wall Street has right now on consumer staples is how they will, as the industry jargon goes, “comp the comp” in the second half of 2021. In other words, can consumer staples still show strong sales and profit gains versus a year ago at the height of the pandemic as people worldwide get back to some form of new normal after inoculation. That return to normal could mean fewer purchases of a range of consumer staples from frozen food to laundry detergent and a related growth slowdown at consumer staples.

P&G’s Moeller is well aware of the concerns on the Street, but remains confident the business is in a new steady state.

“We're looking forward to serving what we believe will be a forever altered consumer need for products that help them with health hygiene and a clean home. There are habits that are being formed during this unfortunately long COVID period that we believe will continue to some degree post COVID,” Moeller said.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

ADAM SHAPIRO: All right, 15 minutes to the closing bell. It looks as if we're going to close-- the indices are going to close in positive territory. The S&P 500 could close up about 1%. And I mention the S&P 500 because our next guest, in one of his notes recently to clients, is saying that over the next 20 years, you can expect a compound increase in the S&P 500 on an average of 7% to 9%.

Let's break this down with Nick Colas. He is the co-founder of DataTrek Research. And your note was very inspiring to me. I'm one of the millions of people who are lazy passive investors. There's a lot of warning that comes with that. But that statistic I just said in your call that over the next 20 years, good news or bad news? What am I missing there, news?

NICHOLAS COLAS: You know, on the good news side, we've never had a 20-year period in the S&P where we've had negative total returns either on a real or nominal basis. So a 20-year horizon is a pretty good one to think about when stocks will always break even or do better for you. So that's the good news, we're north of 0 and should obviously be north of 0 for the next 20 years.

The weird bit is that the returns over 20 years can vary dramatically. And I mean dramatically. Like, it can be as much as 17% a year, which means you're doubling every three, three and 1/2 years. It can be as low as 5%, which we actually just had through 2018 for the prior 20 years. So the returns over the very long term can be wildly different.

And by saying 7% to 9%, we're thinking that we're going to see returns that are pretty good. You are going to double your money every 10 years or so, get two doubles over 20 years. But not as good as what a lot of us remember from, say, 1980 to 1999. That was really the best ever time.

SEANA SMITH: So Nick, with that in mind, how should investors be positioned, then? I guess, what sectors-- I don't think you can name specific names, so what sectors do you expect to outperform, then, at least in the near term?

Story continues

NICHOLAS COLAS: You know, for the near term, and this is talking now three to five years, so near term being not 20, technology still has pride of place, I think, in most people's minds, in our minds about the group that can generate the kind of outsized earnings because of high rates of productivity growth that will generate good returns. Over the next year, just over 2021, we've got to look at more cyclical groups because we all know tech had a fantastic run last year. A lot of the good news is baked in.

And there's not a lot of earnings leverage in the tech sector, really in most cases less than 0, meaning earnings growth is no better than revenue growth. We have to look at financials, industrial, cyclical groups, the stuff in the consumer discretionary except Amazon for the leadership, and that's exactly what we've seen this year. If you look at the S&P year-to-date, all of it, meaning all of it, is due to a little bit of Tesla plus a whole lot of financials and consumer discretionary ex Amazon.

And that's the real tug of war here for the market going through the rest of the year is do we get those cyclical groups to continue to work? I think we do. But that is the subject of debate.

ADAM SHAPIRO: Nick, if I hear you correctly, though, what I'm hearing is that those of us who are passive investors, now may be the time to perhaps consider actively managed investments if we are in that kind of camp, even with the 100 to 200 basis points that we may have to pay or not. Is that what you're actually saying?

NICHOLAS COLAS: That is a great question and the right question to ask. Because let's say you pay 100 basis points of performance, that's 7% to 9% return. We talked about as being realistic over the next 20 years, you're going to give up north of 10% of that return in those active fees. That's a bit of a challenge. This is not a 10% to 15% return market where it's less than 10%.

So you've got to study that calculus very carefully. Are you willing to give up north of 10% of your return to capture some of the upside? And say your active manager gets you 12% instead of 9&, definitely worth it. But you've got to find somebody who you think has the capability of doing that. And it's not as easy as it was back in the late '90s when you're doing 15% to 17% returns, paying 100 bips, not a big deal.

SEANA SMITH: Hey, Nick, the recent action that we've seen in the market, we've seen kind of this push-pull going on. We have the Dow hovering just around 31,000 at this point. What's generating that push-pull action that we've seen in the market lately? Is it all because of stimulus and then worries about COVID? I guess, what are you attributing it to?

NICHOLAS COLAS: Yeah, I think you put your finger on it. Those are the key points. It comes down to how quick we get vaccine rollouts, obviously a big subject of concern. I'm sitting in New York City, and it hasn't been great here.

On the other side, we are looking for more fiscal stimulus. We had presumptive Treasury Secretary Yellen giving testimony today and answering questions. She's clearly in the camp of more sooner is better, which I would agree with. But we don't know exactly what the composition of that's going to be and how tax rates might take a toll on, say, the investor class in terms of what might happen to those.

So it is a real push-pull in terms of how fast will the economy reaccelerate? What sectors are best for that? We talked about financials, industrials versus technology being the safer play. And that's the tug-of-war the market's facing. And it's not easy given the year that we've had to place your bets now in January, given everything that's run so far, so fast.

ADAM SHAPIRO: All right, great to have you here, Nick. Nick Colas is the co-founder of DataTrek Research.

291,2021-01-19T22:07:27+00:00,EBay Explores Strategic Alternatives for Marketplace in Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc. is exploring a potential sale of its online marketplace in South Korea, the latest step in a reorganization that has already hived off several units from the main U.S. e-commerce business.

The San Jose, California-based company said it has “initiated a process to explore, review, and evaluate a range of strategic alternatives for its Korea business. The company is considering options that would maximize value for its shareholders and create future growth opportunities for the business.”

EBay enjoyed a boost during the pandemic as shoppers flocked online, but it continued to grow at a slower pace than rivals, including Amazon.com Inc. EBay has 183 million active buyers and about 11% of its annual revenue comes from South Korea.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone, who took the helm in April, is still trying to show that a slimmed-down EBay can lure customers and get them to spend more on the site. Under pressure from activist investors, EBay last year sold its event-tickets marketplace StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion and its classifieds business to Norway’s Adevinta ASA in a cash-and-stock deal worth $9.2 billion that left EBay with a 44.4% stake in the company.

293,2021-01-19T21:30:03+00:00,Sectors to watch as Biden heads to the White House,"Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous and Chris Versace, Tematica Research CIO, discuss sectors to watch amid a Biden administration.

Video Transcript

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" We have stocks kicking off the holiday-shortened week with a pretty nice rally. Tech stocks having a beautiful day as well, as you can see there in the NASDAQ composite, now up about 1 and 1/2%. I want to stick with the markets now and bring in Chris Versace. He is CIO at Tematica Research. Chris, good to see you. Why did the market come back with this voracious appetite for US equities today?

CHRIS VERSACE: Well, I think it's a number of different things, you know? When we take a look around, you know, treasury secretary or soon-to-be Treasury Secretary Yellen is talking about going big on stimulus. Of course, the market really likes that. It means that interest rates are gonna be low for a period of time. We're seeing potentially further progress in the Biden stimulus plan or the $1.9 trillion that will put, you know, $1,400 checks in people's pockets. He's talking about a $15 minimum wage that would do more of the same, spurring consumption, which as you, and I'm sure most of your viewers, know is about 2/3, directly or indirectly, of the US economy. So there's a variety of things that are happening on that front.

And I think, too, there's a little bit of a [SIGHS SHARPLY]. The past uncertainty on a number of fronts might finally be fading. And I think people are looking forward to, you know, perhaps a coming together, if you will, of the American people and things in several months improving.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Where now earnings are starting to ramp up here, Chris. What are your thoughts on the bank earnings that we got today? It seems as though, when you look at the health of the banking sector, they've been holding up pretty nicely throughout this pandemic.

CHRIS VERSACE: You know, you're absolutely right. And, you know, I was kind of bracing for comments over what the renewed lockdowns were doing, but it doesn't really seem to be hitting them yet. I do think, though, as we migrate through the rest of the earning season, that we are gonna see, unfortunately, some sectors kind of feeling the pain of that. You know, most notably anybody looking for a rebound in retail, per se.

Story continues

But really stepping back too, though, I think when you talk about this overall earnings season, there will be some sectors, like I said, that have to adjust their earnings down. There'll be some that have to adjust up. But overall, Alexis, to really see a pronounced move higher here, we need to see overall earnings expectations start to move higher for 2021. And, you know, the first quarter, it tends to be a little early for that. But we need to see how the Biden plan translates into higher earnings over the next two, three, four quarters so that consensus expectations for S&P 500 earnings start to move higher, you know? And I say that because the PE multiple is pretty far stretched. So to see any further upside, it's got to come on the earnings front.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: What are clients telling you right now? How are they repositioning their portfolios with a new administration in the White House?

CHRIS VERSACE: So it sounds like we want to talk about some sectors that investors might be wanting to pivot into or look as a result of the new administration. You know, when we take a look at it, there are a number of different fronts. I talked about, you know, consumer-focused stocks that could see a lift. We're also going to see infrastructure potentially get a lift as well. It's pretty well known that the US infrastructure has a D-plus rating from the American Society of Civil Engineers. And the Biden camp has talked about putting people to work to rebuild US infrastructure. There are various forecasts for that, some as high as a $4.5 trillion need.

But when we think about companies that could benefit from that, we're talking Caterpillar on the equipment side, Martin Marietta, U.S. Concrete on the material side, Granite Construction, Dycom, for example, as well. There's also the green initiative. And I think that would bode well for a lot of the solar and wind companies, everybody from First Solar to Sunrun, for example. Electric vehicles are likely to get a boost as well. So, of course, Tesla, but also some of the other companies, major autos that are starting to pivot their business into that. You know, at CES very recently, GM made a big show of that. And I think that they will clearly be a company we'll watch over the coming quarters on the EV front.

And then, finally, one other area, of course, that people are waiting to see what happens is gonna be on the marijuana and cannabis front. And I would argue that while the Democrats might be more inclined to be more lenient and forgiving for that, you know, the real key is going to be, to see, excuse me, financial and banking reform so that those companies can actually tap into the financial system. But those are some of the areas.

Others are the extension of rural broadband, which should be good for a number of equipment companies, as well as those companies that actually lay the cable. So here we're talking about know Nokia, Ericsson, Alcatel Lucent, Cisco Systems, for example, as well as even some of the component companies in Corning, for example. And then we want to talk about the companies that actually build out the networks. And that brings us back to Dycom.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, Chris, Jared Blikre here. I just want to round out the discussion with potential headwinds that we could see. We're all talking about the vaccine, but, you know, we have seen positioning in the US dollar get extreme on the short side. We're also seeing rising interest rates. Anything that you see on the horizon here? I also want to mention that the Citi euphoria/panic/greed model is probably at record highs right now. Is the market due for some kind of a pullback? And how do you see it evolving if it does?

CHRIS VERSACE: Well, I would say, Jared, that I think the market is probably-- you know, we see this happen from time to time-- you would argue priced to perfection, where everything has to go right. And, you know, it means going through the earnings season that we've just started and seeing expectations move higher, like I alluded to a few minutes ago. It's the idea that, you know, the Democrats will be able to pass everything rather easily. And we know that that may not be exactly the case. So I agree with you.

295,2021-01-19T17:40:13+00:00,Microsoft bets on GM’s Cruise while Amazon and others back Rivian amid electric vehicle boom,"It’s another big day in the EV (electric vehicle) and AV (autonomous vehicle) space.

General Motors (GM) announced Tuesday it has entered into a “long-term strategic relationship” with Microsoft (MSFT) focused on GM’s autonomous tech division, Cruise.

Included in the deal is new funding, in which Microsoft will join GM, Honda (HMC) and other institutional investors in a combined new equity raise of more than $2 billion in Cruise, pushing its valuation to $30 billion.

Not to be outdone, electric truckmaker Rivian announced it has raised $2.65 billion from an investor group led by asset managers T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Amazon, through its Climate Pledge Fund. The New York Times and Bloomberg estimate Rivian’s new fundraise values the company at over $27 billion. Ford (F) is also a partner and investor in Rivian.

For the automakers, it makes more and more sense to partner with big technology companies. “Microsoft, as the gold standard in the trustworthy democratization of technology, will be a force multiplier for us as we commercialize our fleet of self-driving, all-electric, shared vehicles,"" Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a statement. DETROIT, MICHIGAN, UNITED STATES - 2019/07/31: People admire a GM Cruise self-driving car on display at the General Motors world headquarters building in Detroit's Renaissance Center. (Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

“As Cruise and GM's preferred cloud, we will apply the power of Azure to help them scale and make autonomous transportation mainstream,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, underscoring Ammann’s sentiments.

For companies like Rivian, that straddle the space between tech and autos, raising money and securing technology partners is a necessary precondition for success. As is competing with the big first mover in the space — Tesla (TSLA).

“The process of creating something like this is anything but simple,” Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe said in an interview with the New York Times. “It’s a complex orchestra, several thousand parts coming from several hundred suppliers. It’s definitely far more complex than people think and far more complex than I thought it would be.”

An electric & autonomous arms race

Story continues

Prior to today’s deal, Cruise was worth around $18 billion on paper based on its last fundraise. Many analysts on Wall Street and investors surmised GM’s Cruise division was worth a lot more, and today’s announcement is something of a validation. Before Tuesday’s deal, GM owned slightly more than 80% of Cruise, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

Indeed, GM shares soared to a new high last week, and another new high today, based on the company’s push to electrify its vehicles, services, and component infrastructure (batteries, drivetrains, etc.).

A big factor in a lot of these big stock movements, and even bigger valuations, is Tesla. “The massive ramp of Tesla stock and overall valuation is an undeniable factor here,” iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer tells Yahoo Finance. NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES - 2019/04/17: Rivian R1T seen at the New York International Auto Show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York. (Photo by Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

Rivian, which is private, has been a darling of the VC community and automotive press, as its highly anticipated electric pickup and SUV near production. The company has taken a more measured approach to fundraising and promoting its products, quietly seeking investment (and not through a public offering or uber-popular SPAC merger) and rolling out updates on its vehicles when there’s something concrete to show.

“We want to launch, demonstrate our capability and let our performance speak for itself before we can look into being public,” Scaringe said.

Though Cruise is a pure AV play and integrated into GM’s EV plans, Rivian also is working on AV tech as well (like Tesla).

The big question is whether upstarts like Rivian, and even established automakers like GM and Ford, can effectively compete with Tesla.

“I think there is a sense that if you're not Tesla, you have to make up for some lost time, and time is money,” Brauer says. “There’s a big investment coming to a lot of these Tesla competitors in order to catch up, to be a player in the space.”

Packaging companies are experiencing a strong growth on the back of the e-commerce boom following the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts think that the packaging industry will see innovation and growth in 2021 and beyond. To skip our investment thesis and reasons to invest in packaging stocks, click to read 5 Best Packaging Stocks to Buy Now.

The packaging industry has a robust and long-term growth potential as its applications are widespread and evergreen. According to consultancy firm Smithers, packaging demand is expected to grow 2.8% to reach $1.05 trillion in 2024. Almost all essential and non-essential industries need some sort of packaging. The demand of packaging products is growing in lucrative domains like food, beverages, cosmetics, personal care, healthcare, industrial items and household products. The industry is usually segmented by the type of material, such as paper, plastic, glass and metal.

Coronavirus Crisis: Growth Catalyst for Packaging Stocks?

The packaging industry has proven to be extremely resilient and anti-fragile. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic when most businesses struggled, packaging companies saw huge spikes in sales amid a rise in ecommerce. As businesses shift their focus towards online channels, they are recognizing the importance of packaging for brand image, customer satisfaction and marketing. According to a survey, a majority of sellers think that the use of branded packaging for online orders affects their perception. The COVID-19 pandemic skyrocketed ecommerce sales worldwide as consumers stopped going to physical stores and loaded up on groceries and other items using online channels. Data shows that consumers spent a whopping $347.26 billion online with U.S. retailers in the first 6 months of 2020, up 30.1% from $266.84 billion for the same period in 2019.

The ecommerce trend was already expanding globally as the “Amazon effect” put several physical retailers out of business, and analysts believe that online shopping will continue to grow in the future. Data shows that the e-commerce packaging market was valued at $27.04 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $61.55 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 14.59% over a period of 5 years.

Story continues

In an April 2020 report, McKinsey said that the effect of the coronavirus crisis would be mixed for the packing industry, as the demand for certain packing items will decline while other categories will see explosive growth. The biggest winners will be the packing products for groceries, healthcare products, and e-commerce transportation, while the firm sees some declines for industrial, luxury, and some B2B-transport packaging. While selecting 10 best packaging stocks to buy now, we will incorporate the level of exposure to the growth categories in the industry.

In September, Moody’s changed its outlook for the global packing industry to positive from negative. The firm sees the industry's global operating income to rise 6%-8% over the next 12 months.

Upcoming Growth

The packaging industry has a lot of room for innovation and growth amid a demand of sustainable boxes, environment-friendly coverings, secure and protective packaging for electronics and fragile items. Companies are investing heavily in packaging technologies to provide greater flexibility and adaption for different surfaces, substrates and materials. Consumer companies also want smart, user-friendly and marketable packing products. For example, beverage companies pay a lot of attention to their packing design, position of words, fonts, image styling and material quality. These trends will enhance growth in the industry.

298,2021-01-16T19:31:26+00:00,"Billionaire Louis Bacon Shuns Bitcoin, Returns 70% By Betting On These Stocks","In this article, we presented billionaire Louis Bacon's top 10 stock picks that helped his hedge fund in generating massive gains in 2020. Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Louis Bacon's Top 5 Stock Picks.

Billionaire Louis Bacon’s hedge fund Moore Capital Management has generated massive profits during the first year of trading after the macro hedge fund manager decided to step back from managing investors’ money in 2019 and consolidating its three funds into a single fund. Moore Capital, which oversees Bacon’s and partner's money, gained more than 70% in one of the most unpredictable years.

One of the most successful hedge fund managers of his era Louis Bacon, who established Moore Capital in 1989 using a $25,000 inheritance from his mother and returned 17.6% annualized return since inception through 2019 from its flagship Remington funds, last year said in an investor’s letter that his firm would operate with less participation from him. Here is what he said in an investor’s letter:

“Dear Investor, As Moore Capital Management (MCM) approaches its 30th year at the end of this decade, the time is propitious to take a step I have eyed for some time and “privatize” our three multi-manager flagship funds-- that is to say returning client assets and funding the multi-manager program with private capital from the principals at MCM. These three funds –MGI (Moore Global Investments), RIS (Remington Investment Strategies), and MMM (Moore Macro Advisors)--will (post the return of investor funds) be consolidated into one proprietary fund which will continue to trade and invest with the same line-up of Portfolio Managers, but with less participation from me.” Louis Bacon MOORE GLOBAL INVESTMENTS

However, the reports are hinting that Louis Bacon has still been working with the portfolio managers. The market value of its 13F portfolio grew from just over $2 billion at the end of the March quarter to more than $5.2 billion at the end of the September quarter.

Story continues

The New York-based hedge fund has quickly been making changes in its 13F portfolio to take advantage of the market volatility. For instance, the hedge fund has initiated 222 positions during the September quarter and increased its stake in 38 existing positions. Moreover, the firm has sold-out 102 positions and reduced its position in 63 stocks.

Louis Bacon’s hedge fund believes in diversifying investments across several securities and sectors. The top ten holdings accounted for 41% of the overall portfolio and the hedge fund ended the September quarter with 368 positions.

While Louis Bacon’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start reviewing the top ten stock picks of Louis Bacon's portfolio to see how many returns these positions have generated during the December quarter and in fiscal 2020.

10. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA: GDX)

The billionaire Louis Bacon’s hedge fund has been showing confidence in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA: GDX) over the years. Fortunately, the GDX position has helped the New York-based hedge fund to generate robust returns in 2020. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF underperformed in the last three months, but GDX rallied more than 28% in the last twelve months. Other macro-focused billionaire hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones have been betting on bitcoin in anticipation of an inflationary environment. Moore seems to shun bitcoin and instead picks the more traditional route of investing in gold and gold miners.

Moore Capital Management has raised its position in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF by 49% in the September quarter to 1.02% of the overall portfolio. Gold price came under pressure in the last month amid a strengthening dollar.

VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF is an exchange-traded fund that invests in public equity markets of the global region. The fund invests in stocks of companies operating across materials, metals and mining, gold, silver sectors.

9. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS)

Moore Capital has initiated a stake in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) during the September quarter. The position in the movies and entertainment giant helped the hedge fund to post big gains in 2020 as shares of Disney rallied close to 37% in the last three months. Disney accounted for 1.27% of the overall 13F portfolio at the end of the September quarter.

Third Point, which has posted a return of 10.8% for the second quarter, has also highlighted a compelling investment case for Walt Disney in an investor's letter. Here is what Third Point said:

“During Q2, we initiated a long position in The Walt Disney Company when shares traded down on fears that closures of theme parks and movie theaters due to the coronavirus pandemic would cripple the company. A slew of sell‐side analysts had recently downgraded the stock but we believed they failed to grasp that the pandemic also provided Disney with an important opportunity – to accelerate a plan to bring its blockbuster content directly to the consumer via streaming, which will further elevate Disney’s position as the world’s pre-eminent media company.”

8. Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB)

Louis Bacon’s hedge fund's stake in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) added to its 2020 performance. The hedge fund has sold 22% of its Facebook position in the latest quarter. Despite that, the social media company accounted for 1.33% of the overall portfolio. Shares of Facebook soared more than 30% in fiscal 2020, thanks to staying at home policies.

Facebook was in 230 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to the previous all-time high of 213.

Wedgewood Partners has highlighted a few stocks including Facebook in the investor's letter. Here is what Wedgewood Partners stated:

“Facebook reported 32% growth in constant currency ad revenue, along with expectations for 50-55% growth in expenses as the Company continued with their telegraphed plan to accelerate investments in privacy and security across their social platforms. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also approved a $5 billion fine for violating a 2012 FTC order by misrepresenting users’ ability to control data privacy. While this removed an overhang dating back to early 2018, continued pressure from politicians and regulators kept Facebook’s earnings multiple in check.”

7. FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX)

Moore Capital has initiated a position in FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) during the second quarter and raised its position by more than 1000% during the September quarter. FedEx also contributed to 2020 gains because its shares surged close to 60% in the last six months. In addition, the air courier company also offer dividends to shareholders.

Hedge fund position in FedEx Corporation hit a new all-time high of 71 hedge funds’ in the September quarter compared to the previous all-time high of 53.

Cartenna Capital, which posted a return of 5.6% for the third quarter, commented on a few stocks including FedEx in an investor's letter. Here is Cartenna Capital stated:

“FedEx Corporation (“FDX”) was the Fund’s largest positive contributor to performance during Q3, and we remain very bullish on the entire parcel sector into Q4. When we initially purchased shares of FedEx, it represented an extremely attractive idiosyncratic opportunity embedded within our constructive transportation market outlook. For the past several years, we have generally held a negative bias on FedEx operations as they have routinely suffered from both macroeconomic headwinds (US-China trade war) and company specific issues that have been self-inflicted (i.e. lost Amazon as a customer, poor TNT acquisition/ransomware attack). However, as FedEx began their Fiscal Year 2021 in June, many of these headwinds were poised to reverse and become tailwinds.”

6. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD)

Moore Capital has also benefited from its JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) position in 2020. Although the firm sold its 24% of stake during the third quarter, the e-commerce platform still accounted for 1.53% of the overall portfolio. Shares of JD.com rallied 121% in the last twelve months amid consumer's move towards online platforms during the pandemic.

Third Point Management, which returned 10.8% for the third quarter, highlighted the confidence in JD in an investor’s letter. Here is what Third Point Management stated:

“As the e‐commerce market matures, we believe Alibaba & JD will leverage scale and growing repositories of transaction data to increase monetization of their platforms through targeted advertising to improve revenue yields (revenues as a percentage of GMV) from a starting point of less than 4% today. As a point of comparison, brick‐and‐mortar retail store rent expenses in China are greater than 10% of sales on average, which provides a significant umbrella for online marketplaces to take a greater share of GMV through a combination of commission and advertising spending as online retailer cost structures converge with brick‐ and‐mortar retail.”

But times like these are precisely when it should be. Trying to time trades is tricky business, even for Wall Street bigshots who have been trading for decades with state of the art equipment and a lifetime of institutional knowledge – and occasionally an advanced degree in mathematics.

Trying to outsmart these people or play their game over the long term might be entertaining, but if your goal is to make money, I wouldn’t bother. Finding companies with solid fundamentals in key industries and buying for the long-term might be boring, but it makes money.

9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon

Here are 7 long-term stocks to buy you’ll want to hang onto:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Clorox (NYSE:CLX) JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) Sony (NYSE:SNE)

These companies deserve your attention for the future because of how well they’ve handled the past.

There are few companies that can turn into a global retail brand the way AMZN has done. From a humble online bookseller in the 1990s to market juggernaut in just three decades, Amazon has been on quite the journey.

Now it’s hard for most Americans to imagine a day that doesn’t somehow involve an Amazon product. Whole Foods for grocery shopping (if you’re not buying supplies off its website). Prime for watching shows and movies. Of course, its bread-and-butter retail and logistics operations. And of course, cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services provides plenty of cash to keep all its new and existing ventures running.

When the pandemic hit, everyone realized how valuable AMZN had become. But its value is much more now, as it holds a nearly $1.6 trillion market cap. It is kind of a one-stock index of the entire modern economy. If you’re a long-term bull on the U.S., AMZN is a long-term stock for you.

Up 70% in the past year, its pace may vary but its continued growth isn’t in question.

This company’s beginnings stand almost in direct opposition to that of AMZN. CLX made one product, bleach, for nearly 50 years and built a big business out of it.

Now more than 100 years old, CLX has diversified its product line a bit, though not significantly. Now it has a portfolio of around 50 brands that are sold in over 100 countries. Reliable names like Glad, Handi Wipes, Liquid-Plumr, Pine-Sol and Tilex along with its titular Clorox line. This is a classic long-term US stock.

During the pandemic, cleaning and disinfecting products have been in high demand at home and abroad. CLX stock remains rock solid. And that’s to be expected after growing through two World Wars, the Great Depression and everything else that has come its way.

9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon

Up 24% in the past 12 months, it’s still trading at a P/E of 21 — below the average forward P/E of the S&P 500 — with plenty of growth ahead.

The growth of digital channels in the U.S. is mirrored in China, where its domestic market is almost an order of magnitude larger than U.S. market. The potential is huge.

Also, the Chinese market operates a bit differently than the U.S. Large companies tend to work with each other to leverage their most important assets rather than try to compete head to head.

But they also diversify. For example, JD is like the AMZN of China (and other Asian nations). It has expanded into logistics, AI, fintech and other sectors.

Yet for all of its strength, it trades at one-tenth the market cap of AMZN and that’s after a 127% run in the past 12 months. Certainly there’s some trade risk here, as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges, but JD is far down that list. This is a top long-term stock for the China’s and Asia’s consumers.

This is the company that launched Elon Musk before he became the maverick CEO we all know today.

Even back then Musk was a handful, getting deposed as CEO after a couple years but still holding more stock than anyone else when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchased PYPL in 2002. That became the seed capital for Musk’s later ventures.

But beyond the personality, PYPL is a pioneer in electronic payments and now in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments with its Venmo app. Time and again Wall Street has dismissed PYPL as not having the kind of financial reputation or muscle to take on the big financial institutions in the digital space. And time and again, PYPL has proven them wrong.

The past year has been a boon for PYPL’s model and has showed that big banks weren’t altogether ready for the quick and massive shift to digital. And PYPL now has credit services as well as other payment platforms.

We’re well ensconced in the Mobility Age at this point. By that I mean what started as the digital revolution has now moved to the point where wireless networks keep us connected nearly all the time, much to some people’s chagrin.

But the fact is, despite the downsides, there are plenty of upsides too. And now that 5G telecom tech is upon us, data will be flowing even faster than before.

One the beneficiaries and leaders in pushing digital mobility further is QCOM, one of the world’s leading telecom companies. Its business model is unique because it develops chips and telecom equipment but makes money licensing the technology for others to manufacture and also taking a cut of sales.

Both U.S. and Chinese (and others) phone makers rely on state of the art QCOM chips, especially for 5G. QCOM just signed a new deal to rekindle relations with Chinese phone makers earlier this week. As long as mobility is a thing, this is a long-term stock to own.

The stock is up 75% in the past 12 months, yet the stock is trading at a P/E of 35.

With unemployment nearing 6.7% and many states admitting that the pandemic has hampered their ability to accurately count the unemployed, there are a lot of Americans trying to figure out how to bring in a paycheck.

Many have turned to driving Uber or Lyft, although passenger numbers are down significantly now as well. And taxis are even worse.

That has led many to try their hands at turning their hobbies into businesses. And that’s where SHOP comes in. It’s a cloud-based platform that helps small and mid-sized business build out professional websites.

The stock is up nearly 1000% over the past three years, and much of that has come in the past two years, as the economy has slowed.

Vaccines may be on the way, and the government is working through another stimulus package, but the damage done to the economy has yet to be seen clearly given all the other issues facing the nation.

Launched in 1946 in Japan, SNE has been known to every generation since for various electronics. For decades, SNE made the best televisions in the world after launching the first all-transistor television in 1959 and taking the global television market by storm.

Then came the video generation. Then the Walkman generation, when SNE defined personal, portable music. And now, it’s the PlayStation videogame system.

Along the way, it has moved into the entertainment industry, on both the content and equipment sides. Its contributions to our electronic era are practically too numerous to list and Sony continues to be a formidable player.

The thing is, it generally cuts a low profile. SNE stock is currently up more than 43% in the past 12 months, yet trades at a P/E below 15. This durable, quality electronics firm may not garner headlines, but it still is a revered and important brand, generation after generation.

But times like these are precisely when it should be. Trying to time trades is tricky business, even for Wall Street bigshots who have been trading for decades with state of the art equipment and a lifetime of institutional knowledge – and occasionally an advanced degree in mathematics.

Trying to outsmart these people or play their game over the long term might be entertaining, but if your goal is to make money, I wouldn’t bother. Finding companies with solid fundamentals in key industries and buying for the long-term might be boring, but it makes money.

9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon

Here are 7 long-term stocks to buy you’ll want to hang onto:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Clorox (NYSE:CLX) JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) Sony (NYSE:SNE)

These companies deserve your attention for the future because of how well they’ve handled the past.

There are few companies that can turn into a global retail brand the way AMZN has done. From a humble online bookseller in the 1990s to market juggernaut in just three decades, Amazon has been on quite the journey.

Now it’s hard for most Americans to imagine a day that doesn’t somehow involve an Amazon product. Whole Foods for grocery shopping (if you’re not buying supplies off its website). Prime for watching shows and movies. Of course, its bread-and-butter retail and logistics operations. And of course, cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services provides plenty of cash to keep all its new and existing ventures running.

When the pandemic hit, everyone realized how valuable AMZN had become. But its value is much more now, as it holds a nearly $1.6 trillion market cap. It is kind of a one-stock index of the entire modern economy. If you’re a long-term bull on the U.S., AMZN is a long-term stock for you.

Up 70% in the past year, its pace may vary but its continued growth isn’t in question.

This company’s beginnings stand almost in direct opposition to that of AMZN. CLX made one product, bleach, for nearly 50 years and built a big business out of it.

Now more than 100 years old, CLX has diversified its product line a bit, though not significantly. Now it has a portfolio of around 50 brands that are sold in over 100 countries. Reliable names like Glad, Handi Wipes, Liquid-Plumr, Pine-Sol and Tilex along with its titular Clorox line. This is a classic long-term US stock.

During the pandemic, cleaning and disinfecting products have been in high demand at home and abroad. CLX stock remains rock solid. And that’s to be expected after growing through two World Wars, the Great Depression and everything else that has come its way.

Up 24% in the past 12 months, it’s still trading at a P/E of 21 — below the average forward P/E of the S&P 500 — with plenty of growth ahead.

The growth of digital channels in the U.S. is mirrored in China, where its domestic market is almost an order of magnitude larger than U.S. market. The potential is huge.

Also, the Chinese market operates a bit differently than the U.S. Large companies tend to work with each other to leverage their most important assets rather than try to compete head to head.

But they also diversify. For example, JD is like the AMZN of China (and other Asian nations). It has expanded into logistics, AI, fintech and other sectors.

Yet for all of its strength, it trades at one-tenth the market cap of AMZN and that’s after a 127% run in the past 12 months. Certainly there’s some trade risk here, as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges, but JD is far down that list. This is a top long-term stock for the China’s and Asia’s consumers.

301,2021-01-15T14:12:06+00:00,Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan could wreck Wall Street's favorite money-making trade,"President-elect Joe Biden’s extensive $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may supercharge economic growth, but also send Wall Street’s favorite five tech stocks known as FAANG into a short-term price slumber.

While naturally Biden’s fiscal relief won’t be causing quarterly earnings misses at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google, his plan could dent market psychology on the stocks and in turn what multiple investors are willing to pay on each.

The line of thinking is rather straightforward to astute market watchers.

Biden’s stimulus package could send investors rushing into more cyclical stocks in the retail, energy and materials space in advance of strong lifts to the respective sector earnings growth rates. Those funds may come from cashing out of FAANG stocks, which gained an average 43% (versus a 27% rise in the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund) over the past year fueled by views on the Street of Big Tech being economic safe havens.

Interestingly, this dynamic may already be playing out. Shares of the FAANG stocks are all slightly lower (Netflix the worst performer, is down 6.1%) year-to-date compared to the 1.1% gain for the S&P 500.

Supporting the possible rotation would be Wall Street analysts moving quickly to push up profit estimates on cyclical areas of the market. Looked at another way, investors would be positioning for faster earnings growth this year and next out of cyclicals relative to FAANG stocks because of the latest stimulus package.

“The spending comes at an interesting junction for analysts and investors as it will no doubt mean further EPS upgrades. It will also mean that many early cycle S&P 500 sectors will see faster earnings revisions than the popular FAANG+ and IT which dominated investor attention in 2020,” points out Jefferies strategist Sean Darby.

Not even 24-hours after Biden released his economic revival plan, Wall Street has already laid the groundwork for the unwind of the FAANG long trade.

Story continues

Darby says his economic team at Jefferies lifted its 2021 U.S. GDP target to 6.4% from 5.25% after the release of Biden’s proposal. Jefferies analysts also raised their price targets and EPS estimates on their industrial coverage, Darby says.

The immediate tone is similar at Goldman Sachs.

“We do not expect all of the elements of the proposal to pass, but we are increasing our assumption of additional near-term fiscal measures from $750 billion (3.4% of GDP) to $1.1 trillion (5% of GDP),” Goldman’s Chief Economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a flash note to clients.

Not everyone on the Street is ready to toss in the towel on FAANG stocks, however.

Bulls argue that with the pandemic continuing to rage on and putting the economic recovery at risk no matter of a fresh stimulus injection, FAANG remains the best place to be. Companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google offer strong business models and growth prospects for the foreseeable future — and any dips in their stock prices should be bought, say the bulls.

“The FAANG names all have Josh Allen-like [Buffalo Bills quarterback] tailwinds, Biden is just evening the playing field for industrial, manufacturing, and small businesses on the other side of this dark chapter of growth,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says. “We view Biden plan as bullish for the market and our view is tech stocks still have another 25%+ upside for 2021.”

No doubt though the winds are starting to blow in the direction of the cyclical on the FAANG off-trade.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, ""Oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.""

HAIM SABAN: I say baloney. You know, he's-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters maybe he's a little bit left of me. But he's more of a centrist than a left wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who was able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal. And I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again there are so many avenues that you can take to address that inequality. But I am truly, in my heart of hearts 100% convinced that he's the right man to address that inequality. He is a guy with a heart. We miss heart over the last four years. We [? were ?] [? all ?] [? served ?] by cynicism and division.

JARED BLIKRE: I want to thank you all for joining our seventh Yahoo Finance Premium webinar, a Roadmap to Trading Profitably and Consistently in 2021, because what a year it's been already. I'm Jared Blikre, and soon, we're going to be joined by JC Parets. He's a chartered market technician who also founded All-starCharts.com. If you follow me on Twitter, you probably know him as well.

We're going to be breaking down the major investment themes that we've seen unfold since the election-- tons of charting, lots of shoptalk. You're going to love it. We're going to show you also how to get the most out of Yahoo Finance Premium-- how you can use it to find stocks that show signs of promising returns, use it to analyze your portfolio, and get some of the latest analysts' insights on all the big tickers that are moving today and this year.

Now, if you've been to one of our webinars before, you probably know how the Blue Jeans software operates. It's owned by our parent company Verizon. For everyone else, here's how it works. Now, you're going to be able to interact with us in real time. You can ask us questions. There is a button for that on the right hand side of your browser.

You can also participate in polls. We're going to do one of those in just a minute here. And again, that's on the right hand side of your browser. So you might want to check that out now. Also, there is a slider on the lower left. And you're going to want to check that out, because you can adjust the presentation sides. We're going to be showing you some charts, and you can also adjust the size of both me and JC. You might want to make us a little bit smaller so you can see all the good stuff that we're going to be showing you.

Story continues

All right, so let's begin here with our first poll. Now, this is a little bit more complicated than we usually begin with, but this has to do with the themes that we're talking about in this webinar. So when the US Treasury yield curve expands, cyclical and value stocks tend to, 1, sell off, 2, trade sideways, or 3, rally?

All right, now I want to bring in JC. And it's great to have you here, really excited for this. And I want to just kind of begin with the layout for 2021. We've seen a lot of rotation going back to November of last year around the election, kind of pricing in things. We just had the Georgia runoff, so we kind of have a blue wave, or maybe just a blue ripple here-- not strong majorities either way. But what are you seeing in the markets, and what do you see for the year ahead here?

JC PARETS: Thanks, Jared, for having me. For me, it's really more of the same. And for us, we always like to think about what the market environment's going to look like if we're going to be proven right. And we want to think about what the market environment is going to look like if we're going to be proven wrong. And we've been incredibly bullish since April, fortunately. We haven't been fighting this trend.

In fact, you know, we've been irresponsibly aggressive is kind of how I like to put it, because, you know, really, everything was favoring stocks going much higher. So coming into the year, what are we watching to perhaps change our mind, maybe get more defensive? We want to look at those defensive assets. What are they doing?

Are Treasury bonds, are they getting a bit? No, they're making new relative lows. What about gold, are they getting a bid? No, they're making new relative lows. What about consumer staples-- are they outperforming or are they underperforming? They keep underperforming.

All of these things are classic characteristics of environments that investors are being rewarded for owning stocks, not for shorting them. Look at the currency market-- something like an Aussie yen keeps making new highs. That would most likely be rolling over if stocks are going to be under pressure. And then we keep getting expansion and participation expansion and breadth.

More stocks making new highs, more stocks getting overbought, more countries around the world breaking out of bases to new highs, not just Taiwan and South Korea, now emerging markets in general breaking out. They're not characteristics of environments that we want to be spending our time looking for stocks to short-- actually the opposite. We want to keep spending our time looking for stocks to buy.

JARED BLIKRE: All right, so let's go over a few tickers. As you were talking, I showed the bond market, TLT-- that's a favorite, also the general market, S&P 500. Tell me what you want to start with? What do you want to take a deep dive into it at this particular moment?

JC PARETS: Well, I think people keep asking me when we're going to get a correction. When is this correction coming? You know, we're due for a correction, or long in the tooth.

JARED BLIKRE: Those are always healthy, by the way.

JC PARETS: What's that?

JARED BLIKRE: I said, which are always healthy, by the way. But sorry to interrupt, go ahead.

JC PARETS: It's when they stop asking, right? Now for me, I look at something like the XLK. The United States Technology Index represents pretty much a quarter of the entire S&P 500 and has done nothing since the beginning of September. And let's remember-- Amazon, Google, Facebook-- none of these are technology stocks. None of those are in the technology index.

So if you add those, let's call technology plus those three big monsters-- and Netflix isn't technology either, throw that in there-- and the truth is, 40% of the S&P 500 has done nothing for four months. You know, you want to look for a correction, what's that?

You know, zoom out-- zoom out, look at the Dow Jones Transportation Index, look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average-- both of those did nothing for three years. They peaked in early 2018. Dow industrials, the global 100 index, the Dow transports peaked early 2018, did nothing for three years-- broke out. So I don't know why everyone's looking for a correction, I think we're just getting going.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, you know, it's kind of easy to do that. I think people get wrapped up in the news cycle. And just one more question, then we're going to get to the poll and get some user questions here. I have to ask you-- in this particular environment, what's informing your decisions the most? I mean, how important is it for investors to just kind of focus on the price action or if they're reading fundamental reports, and just kind of not pay attention so much to the daily, if not hourly and second by second, news flow?

JC PARETS: Well, the only truth, the only facts in this world that we can count on is price. Everything else is an estimate, or an opinion, or a government release that's going to change. So when the government comes out with unemployment, and CPI, and all of this stuff, those are just estimates. We know they're going to be revised in the coming months and quarters. That's not the secret, we know that.

So we know the information that they're delivering is incomplete information, number one-- and estimates. What about fundamental research, like talk to these accountants. I encourage you guys. If you guys think I'm completely full of it, go take out young accountants, and take them out to dinner, take them out to lunch, get them drunk, buy them a bunch of booze, right, get them talking-- 23, 24, 25-year-old accountants that are doing this auditing, they don't know the first thing about the things that they're auditing. Ask them, they'll tell you.

And it's like an ongoing joke internally at these accounting firms. So by the time to sell side analyst gets this research or gets the data, who knows what they're looking at, number one. Number two, let's just assume that the accountants are good and they're getting good data, then the fundamental analyst needs to go in there and figure out what these numbers mean, and then come up with his own estimates or her own estimates.

Again, there's too many variables involved. Forget all that, you can't trust it. What about CEOs? They talk a lot, they say a lot of things. Many cases, they could just be wrong-- that happens-- or maliciously lying to you, you know, for their own selfish reasons. It could be either one of those. Both happen regularly.

So the only thing that we can actually trust, the only fact is that there's a willing buyer and willing seller at a specific price on a specific date at a specific time. And no matter what happens ever, that's not going to change. And we know mathematically-- I mean, you could use common sense by looking at charts, but we know mathematically that market returns don't fall under normal distribution. Markets trend.

That's why technical analysis works. So instead of all that other stuff in the news-- don't even get me started, I don't know how that's helpful-- they're in the distraction business. They're not in the information business. So the only truth that we can count on is price, Jared. Telling you from the bottom of my heart-- sure, there's some other stuff that might be able to help us-- maybe-- but the thing that we know will is the truth, and that's price.

JARED BLIKRE: Wise words there. And on those normal distributions that don't seem to fit to the market, I think that's why we get those 14 standard deviation moves about once or twice a year. But I want to get to--

JC PARETS: Seven sigma moves, moves that should only happen once every, like, 10 billion years happen on a weekly basis.

JARED BLIKRE: They do, especially lately. So here's the results for our first poll. When the US Treasury yield curve expands, cyclical and value stocks tend to-- in fact, they rally. Now, the sell-off answer got 39%, trade sideways 18%, rally is the number one answer at 43%. But that's something that I like to look at on a day-to-day basis.

Where is the Treasury yield, especially a 10-year, opening up? If it's up big, you can probably guess certain stocks like the value in cyclicals and the small caps are going to be bid, at least early on. If it's down, probably going to be those big mega caps. So now we're going to get to our next poll, and then we're going to take some questions from the audience here.

So poll-- what percentage of US stock volume do retail traders now comprise? Is it 5%, 10%, 20%, or 50%? We're going to keep that open for a bit now.

JC PARETS: Do you know the answer, Jared? Do you know the answer?

JARED BLIKRE: Well, just don't tell anybody just yet. They got to vote first.

JC PARETS: I don't. I don't know the answer.

JARED BLIKRE: I got this from a previous-- a previous webinar that I did, somebody sent this. And I was surprised, because it's actually increasing. And I think that has to do with the Robinhood trade. But we'll talk about that when we do the results for that in a second.

So now we got some questions here from the audience. This one's from Alton. With the political turmoil that we are going through today with the US, what impact might we see as a result? Downward effects or no change? And for me, I think this kind of gets back to my statements-- and we were talking about the news flow-- that you can't pay too much attention to it, especially on a day-by-day basis.

Because especially political disruptions, while who's in office, and Democrats versus Republicans, blue wave, whatever, that can inform sector decisions-- and infrastructure is obviously a big play right now-- volatility in the markets due to what happened last year with the storming of the Capitol, that tends to be mean reverting within a few hours or days. And we saw that. We saw price come back that same day, that same night.

So I wouldn't put too much stock into crazy political events, social upheaval. These things tend to be resolved rather quickly. Something that's much more meaningful in the market is what's happening with the economy or what people think is going to happen with the lag. But as JC said, that's all kind of baked into the price.

I want to get to cryptocurrency. We got to get there, because it's been on fire. So we've got a question from Leit-- what is your outlook on investing in cryptocurrency for 2021? I'll let you kick this off, JC. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin and the rest?

JC PARETS: Yeah. Well, first of all, getting back to the political turmoil-- fair to say, when is there not political turmoil? If it's not in this country, it's in another country-- China-- I've been doing this for 20 years. There's always political turmoil. This is not anything new, the market doesn't care.

I mean, the market might care a little bit, it might be a small factor, but there's so many more other important factors taking place than that little quote unquote ""disruption"" that's going to be the big news of the day. But the news of the day and what the market cares about that are structural trends are two completely different things, right? I just want to touch on that. As far as cryptocurrencies, I don't know if you noticed, but the trend is up, right? I mean, that is--

JARED BLIKRE: I noticed that.

JC PARETS: I think 47,000 is next. Where's Bitcoin now? Bitcoin's sitting right around 36,000, right? So we're pretty much in between-- think the floor has been 30,000. I think that's still the case. Ceiling for right now is 45. That's the next target. If it's below 30, I think then it's in trouble, and then there's a lot more risk, in my opinion, if you see Bitcoin below 30.

Above 30, and I think that that's a respectable level, and 45 is next-- 45 to 47, something like that based on our math.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and just real quickly, I think this is kind of how you tend to see the market with these levels that just evolve by the price action that you see in candlestick charts, but you also use Fibonacci extensions. What other tools do you use to help you view the market? And just for the audience, there's no one right answer. You have to do what works for you. But I'm asking you, JC, how are you seeing things here?

JC PARETS: Yeah, you know, there's never been an asset in history where there's no fundamentals like this, right? There's not a company, there's no earnings. It's just fu-gay-zi, fu-gah-zi, right? It's just an idea. So because of that, it doesn't mean you can't make money, there's just no fundamentals.

So you have no choice but to analyze the behavior of the market and market participants-- that's technical analysis. As it turns out, boy, oh, boy does this thing trade-- you can really visualize the supply and demand dynamics that are taking place in this. You know, when we got back up to those former highs, it sold off. Like, that resistance was there.

When we broke out above resistance, it shot up. You know, when it came back and retested it, it tested it successfully and went on. Like, this thing-- you read, like, this is like-- stocks don't trade technically so cleanly, and futures even less-- and currencies don't even get me started. Like, this is, like, chapter one of, like, technical analysis kindergarten class.

Like, this is, like, going back to the basics helps unbelievably in cryptocurrencies-- more so than any other asset class. And I do this all day. I read through 5,000 charts a week, so I'm telling you.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, I know your favorite time is the end of the month here when you get those monthly candlestick bars. And I just want to point out in Bitcoin, that chart we had up showing a 27% decline, which means nothing for Bitcoin. They've had at least four 80% to 90% drawdowns. I'm not sure we're going to see that again given the institutional participation-- whatever that is-- but you got to be able to withstand the volatility.

And if you're trading in the futures market with leverage, good luck. That's why I don't trade it in the futures market. I do want to get to a clip we have of Mike Novogratz. We interviewed him earlier today on our live shows. He's talking about Bitcoin and the prospects for a Bitcoin ETF. So let's take a listen.

MIKE NOVOGRATZ: We have a de facto ETF in the Grayscale Trust. And if you think about what the SEC is supposed to do to protect the little guy, they've now allowed a $20 billion kind of faith ETF, right-- it's a closed-end fund, a trust to be retail's outlet, where retail is buying Bitcoin anywhere from a 15% to 30% premium and paying high fees.

And so it's kind of crazy that the SEC thought they did their job stopping an ETF when they actually allowed various business to get started-- this Grayscale Trust. It should have been the exact opposite. And so I think you will see an ETF come soon.

Again, what is soon? It's probably within the year, because it takes a while when you get to a new job and process this whole thing. A lot of the ETF discussion was around good pricing on the index. Right now, the CME future trades with tons of liquidity. You can argue it's great pricing. And so I think we'll see an ETF, like I said, within the year.

JARED BLIKRE: All right, ETF within the year-- been a long time. And I just want to show this real quickly to show people what he's talking about in case you didn't know. This is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. And if you're a US investor, you have to trade it on the OTC, not an official-- it's not listed on any of the major exchanges here, but it has been quite liquid. And people are noting those inflows into the Bitcoin Trust and out of gold.

All right, so let's take another couple questions from the viewers here before we go into the next section. Let's see-- we've got a Tesla question. We've got to do that. Do you believe the valuation this far, example, Tesla, lots of stocks seem to have gone crazy due to retail investors and not true valuations. This comes from Sid. You know, what's the true valuation? And then I know we're kind of getting into the fundamental side, and that's not what you look at, JC, but there's a lot of--

JC PARETS: There's no fundamentals. They don't make money. There's no fundamentals in Tesla. That's not a thing.

JARED BLIKRE: Hey, they made an adjusted profit over the last, what, four or five quarters? You're rolling your eyes, but I see exactly what you're saying. But let's actually pull a Tesla here. I'm going to share my screen in a second, and maybe you can help me with the technicals here, JC.

And here we go with Tesla. All right, so what do you do with a stock like this? We can see some nice consolidation in certain areas. Specifically, I'm looking at this in here. And this is what Tesla has done many times before. It's based, and then it's broken out.

You could call this kind of a base in here-- maybe we're forming one now. But do you jump in? Do you wait? How do you attack this, JC?

JC PARETS: Yeah, no, we've been bullish for sure. Our targets actually were just getting hit over the last couple of weeks, so now I think it's time to sort of shy back a little bit, or a lot. This isn't for us right now. It's had a heck of a run. We're thrilled about it. The consolidation you're pointing to from September, October, November, that-- speaking of classic technical analysis, like, that is-- pick any uptrend ever, right, on any time frame ever, you know what you're going to find? You're going to find those.

You're going to find things exactly like that-- a sideways consolidation, sort of a series of higher lows, a series of lower highs, sort of approaching an apex, and ultimately a resolution. That resolution tends to happen many more times over in the direction of the underlying trend, not reversing in the opposite direction. And this time, obviously, was no different-- consolidated perfectly, obviously within an ongoing uptrend, result higher.

So it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, unless you were just, like, looking at the chart upside down or blindfolded or something, right? So it was pretty obvious here. Our target is 900, we're basically there. So now I think we let it chill out.

Listen, I think this thing can go to 1,500, I just don't think it's going to get there tomorrow. I think we let it chill out. Let's say we get another one of these consolidations over the next few months, then we buy the next breakout. And that could take a while.

JARED BLIKRE: Tesla $1,500 for the second time. All right, this is going to help us answer the previous poll. And we can see this tracks retail investors-- how much they comprise of the trading in the stock market. This goes back to 2010. You can see it's up to 20% now, and I think a lot of that has to do with the rise of Robinhood and all the retail traders that came into the market over the last year, for obvious reasons.

So just to get back to the poll, yeah, people got it right. 20% got the biggest share of the votes, 56%. 14% said 50%, 21% 10%, and then 9% said 5%. So most people got that right. I think we might have used that one a few webinars ago.

All right, so we got to talk-- actually, yeah, we have to talk about Yahoo Finance Premium. So just give me a second, I'm going to bring up my screen, and I'm going to share this with everybody and just kind of go over some of the basics of how to use our service here. And you can also, by the way, get a free 14-day test drive with it.

All right, so you should be able to see my screen. And we're looking at-- and I'm going to get back to our dashboard-- this is a research reports page, which I was just looking at. As soon as you come in, you're going to see your portfolio performance. You can load this in with custom tickers you want. You can sync it with your brokerage account so it knows exactly your positions and the timing of them.

I just have an arbitrary portfolio here that I constructed some time ago. But you can click on these different tabs. We have insights here-- so they'll give you insights on valuation. It says five of 13 stocks are overvalued. You can look at the risk profile-- moderately aggressive.

That, again, shows you the annual performance. And then it shows you the diversity of your portfolio. You see communication services here are heavily weighted. I didn't mean to click that. And we'll just go back here for a second.

And then as you scroll down the page, you can see we have research reports, and we get into some of those in a second. You can see what's at their value. Company outlook-- we even have an ESG ranking, which is becoming increasingly important to a lot of longer term investors-- and shorter ones as well. And then technical events-- this is my favorite, go over some of these technical events and various stocks.

And we'll just start with something that happened today. We got this-- over the last two days, Intel has been a hot stock. And I was looking at what happened this morning. They were up about 10%-- pretty impressive movement to get rid of the CEO and change that out in such a big stalwart company. Let's do this. Research reports.

If I can get my mouse working-- there we go. So I looked for the latest research report-- probably not going to have too much from the Street until later in the day or tomorrow. But only yesterday, they came up with a report because they were at the CES delivering one of the addresses, getting into some new areas. And I was able to download it.

And this is the kind of report that you're going to see. Intel's Mobileye calls for commercially viable autonomous vehicles by 2025. Mobileye really the leader in that space-- Intel bought them about three years ago for $15 billion. And today, they have that CEO switch probably at the behest of these activist investors. So I'd be expecting a note on that over the next 24 hours.

But just getting back to the service here and how you can use it for investment decisions, I like to go straight to investment ideas. And this has both fundamental and technical reports. I actually just did a segment on HPQ-- this call a couple of hours ago on our live program. This outlines how HP is really getting back, where people are now in a replacement cycle for their now dusty PCs and printers.

And I love the technical events too. I was looking at, I think, A&F is in here recently-- Abercrombie and Fitch. So it poses-- when you click on this, it's going to show you that this stock has formed a pattern called upside breakout, provides a target price for the intermediate term, and it tells you what it is. And what I really like is you can look at the chart-- you can see exactly the technical pattern as it's being identified. This is kind of algo-driven, but this is kind of textbook inverse head and shoulders pattern that we're seeing here.

So this is just one of many ways you can actually use this service. And it shows you on the right panel here exactly what this upside breakout-- what the components are, what it means, event description. And in fact, you have all of these. If your time horizon is medium term, you can click on that. You can look at what the long term technical events are, and it'll show you that.

Price crosses over, moving average-- it'll automatically switch to a weekly chart. This is just to give you ideas as to what's possible. It's not like every single one is going to work out, but this is a potential starting point to filter for looking for some technical formations-- and in the case of these research reports, fundamental considerations that you may want to have for getting into a stock.

So we're taking a question now on Yahoo Finance Premium from Jason. Hi, does Yahoo Premium offer SMS price alerts for both equities and options?

I don't think we have the options in our-- I don't think we've taken that on just yet. It's something that we're looking at. But I believe you can get alerts for the equities and for your tickers. Whether they're SMS, I'd have to check on that. But we're constantly developing new functionality within the Premium service, and we're rolling out new features all the time.

So now I want to get to our poll numbers. Excuse me, I think this is our third poll. What percent of IPOs increase 100% in the first year? So I'll give my producers a second to get that on the screen. What percent of IPOs increase 100% in the first year-- is it 10%, 20%, 50%, or 80%? And I'm going to take it back to JC.

I want to ask you about methodology, about good habits as a trader, trading psychology. We've seen this huge increase in volatility, record volatility last year-- never had any spike like that in the VIX. And things just get priced in more quickly.

And for me, it means you've got to have-- you've got to tighten up your trading rules-- maybe you should tighten up your stops. How do you approach trading in this current environment, JC?

JC PARETS: Yeah, no, I think it's important to recognize what type of environment we're in, right? So, like, a lot of investors that I've noticed is that people, like, have their strategy or, like, what they like to do. And then they always do that no matter what type of environment we're in. That doesn't make any sense.

And I learned this-- I learned this from Jeff DeGraff, my opinion, one of the best technicians out there-- has been for a while-- and he taught me, first, identify what environment we're in. Then you can figure out what tools to use. Like, for example, we're not going to brush our teeth with a hammer. That doesn't make any sense at all.

We have a toothbrush for that. We have a different tool for that particular environment. Then when the wife calls and she wants me to hang a mirror on the wall, I'm not going to get my toothbrush. I have a different tool for that. We'll first identify the environment, then the tools.

Some tools are better in trending environments. Some are better for range-bound environments and are useless in trending environments, right-- all of those things. And then volatility-- higher volatility, do you want to be just buying premium and spending all that money on volatility? Or do you want to be financing your options trades, taking in that income to pay for those trades?

So first the environment, then we're in. We're in a lower volatility environment, stocks are trending higher, you're able to get cheap premium, and go out five, six months in some cases because of that. So you don't need four lags on an options trade. You can just buy the calls and call it a day, because that's the environment we're in, right? That's how I approach it.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I just want to point out, we have the VIX on our screen here, and we still have relatively elevated volatility. I mean, if you look at the prior trading epic, that's kind of how I think about the markets is that over a period of years, you just kind of have these whatever market environment tends to be the dominant ones. So back a few years ago-- back a few years ago, we had something that looked like this, which was relatively low volatility.

And then all of a sudden, we spiked higher, and now we kind of have this floor at 20. So until we start trading below 20 in the VIX, or at least until it starts reflecting the options market that way, I think we're going to have these rapidly priced-in events like we've seen over the last year. And some of that's a function of liquidity.

There are secular trends there too that we went over with Jay Woods in our last webinar with the rise of electronic trading, diminishment-- and basically there are no pit traders anymore participating during the day, even less so on the closing options than there used to be. But all that kind of fits together that we are in a different trading environment right now, especially with new leadership.

So I want to get to a couple more questions. And I'm just looking through them right now. How are the markets going to behave in the coming months? Can we bet on a bull market with Biden in the office? That comes from Birken. And a lot of people ask these kinds of questions, and they're perfectly fine.

I just want to emphasize that we have current market leaders. We've seen rotation into value, and cyclicals, and small caps. We've seen bond yields rising. And I would expect these trends to continue until they don't. And when is that going to be? There's going to be some exogenous event.

Maybe the vaccines don't work out well. Maybe there's a new mutant strand, or maybe something happens politically. Maybe something happens with China-- we don't know. But the markets are going to inform us of that. And, JC, any thoughts on that?

JC PARETS: Yeah, I mean, listen, the market's not going to go up because of Biden, or despite Biden, or because of Trump, or despite Trump. Like, depending on what side you're on, you're going to use those words differently. It doesn't matter. The market has so many more important things to worry about than the president of one country on Earth. Like, you know, to over-think that is just, I think, incredibly irresponsible.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. And we're getting a question about cannabis stocks. I do want to hit a couple of those. Is now the time-- this comes from Keith-- and I think we have the Canopy Growth CEO. We have a clip of him that I want my producers to get ready, we'll hit that in a minute. What do you think about the cannabis space, JC? And I'm going to get some charts up. Give me a ticker that you might be looking at or not.

JC PARETS: Well, like CRON.

JARED BLIKRE: Cronos?

JC PARETS: Yeah, I mean, that's one. Canopy Growth, as you mentioned-- right? CCGC.

JARED BLIKRE: Yep. Anything that you're seeing technically? I'm showing the chart here. And first, I just want to point out that these stocks have gotten obliterated-- absolutely obliterated-- over the last couple of years. This is a five-year chart. If you drill down to a one year, it looks like more of a road to recovery here. And I'm seeing, at least in the short term, higher highs, higher lows-- that all suggests that we at least have a short maybe intermediate uptrend in place.

But looking back, this still has quite a while to do-- quite a ways to reclaim some of those prior levels. So how are you viewing this stock, Cronos Group, right now, JC?

JC PARETS: Yeah, look at that base throughout late 2019, early 2020. I mean, these things are absolute garbage. If you got on that train in 2017, 2018, you made money, great. If you didn't get out, shame on you. There were so many opportunities to get out of these messes.

This has been one of the biggest disasters in the history of the US stock market. Now, with that being said, it has built in that bottom. I mean, zoom in to that base, you know, call it a head and shoulders bottom, call it a Kardashian bottom-- whatever it is you want to call it-- Edwards and Magee would call it a saucer bottom-- that's what it looks like to me.

But I think it's only valid-- by my work, it's only valid if we're above $9. So if we're above $9, you got my blessing. I think this thing goes to $12 next. That's the next level. If we're below $9, let it go to $0. Leave it alone.

JARED BLIKRE: Got you. I'm just going to kind of chart what you may be seeing in terms of support and resistance. I'm seeing this at about $9. And then I think you mentioned $12 to the upside-- that's going to take us into this price action in here, maybe a little bit higher. But that's why I love candlestick charts, because you get that look-- you're able to see supply and demand on these charts in a way that you just kind of don't with the line charts, just because of lack of granularity.

All right, so I want to get to the results of our poll here. There's going to be a quiz at the next webinar on everything that we learned here today. What percent of IPOs increase 100% in the first year? Most people said 10%. That is a wrong answer. The right answer is 20%-- 34% of people got that right.

And then 25 votes for 50% and 7% for 80%. So there you have that. And we're going to do one more poll here. And this is the best Cuban sandwich in Miami may be found at Sergio's, Pollo Tropical, Joe's Pizza, El Palacio de los Hugos, some food truck in Flagami. And of course, we're both from Miami.

We both grew up there, and we're going to-- and by the way, there are some wrong answers. I wish there were no wrong answers to that question, but some of those guys don't make Cuban sandwiches. So we'll get the results of that in a second. But back to the cannabis stocks. I want my producers to be able-- I'd like you guys to play that clip that we have of the Cronos Group CEO now.

- The thing that we have that I think differentiates us is we have this pre-wired acquisition of the multistate operator Acreage which we can immediately close on a transaction and take control of that company upon a permissibility event. The Moore Act is definitely one of those permissibility events. And again, Zack, we feel pretty bullish that some variant of the Moore Act, maybe with some changes versus the one that made its way through the House in December, will get passed this year. And then for us, that's a great opportunity, because we would immediately be able to bring our balance sheet, and our brands, and our innervation to the US through that Acreage acquisition.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and the big thing about cannabis, just looking at the macro picture for it, is getting it legalized in the US. Because right now, these companies really can't use the banking system. And so as that potentially changes-- and it's going be hard to change it with a 50-50 Senate right now, even with the vice president as a tie breaker. Joe Biden hasn't really been pro-cannabis in the past.

So we'll have to see how this all works out. But I think incremental steps are being made here. And that could be why we're seeing the price react the way it is. But at the end of the day, you know, only price pays. And I think everything you need to know is basically in the chart-- at least if you're a short term investor.

I do want to point out-- I was just looking through our Yahoo Finance Premium site for information of fundamental reports on Canopy Growth, and this is what we're looking at here. So we got this Morningstar weekly summary. This is from last week, January 8. We got an analyst report on Canopy Growth. You can download that here if you're within our site-- so lots of value added there.

All right, well, I think we have the results of our last poll. I'm not sure if it's still open. And it looks like-- yes, we do have some answers here. So some food truck in Flagami got the number one answer to the best Cuban sandwich in Miami. Many of you found that. 34% of you said that. El Palacio de los Hugos, 32%. 7% said Joe's Pizza, they don't make it.

Pollo Tropical, 13%-- they don't make it, because it's not chicken. And Sergio's-- if you're from Miami, Sergio's pretty good restaurant. They got a bunch of locations. I make nothing off this plug right here. But that got--

JC PARETS: Go to Sergio's. Those are my friends' parents. I grew up with the-- I played baseball with the kids, Luis and Carlos.

JARED BLIKRE: In Flagami?

JC PARETS: No. Later on in life-- in high school and stuff like that. And college-- I played against them in college.

JARED BLIKRE: I was West Kendall optimist all the way. All right, I want to get into some of our hot tickers now. We had some questions about IPO stocks before, so let me bring up a chart of Airbnb that I've prepared. I happen to use Anchored VWAP. It's something I've used as an indicator for 11 or 12 years now.

Brian Shannon of Twitter Fame, he uses it. And here is a 30-minute chart of Airbnb going back to its IPO day. And the reason I'm using a 30-minute chart is because the daily candles just don't really provide enough information yet. But Anchored VWAP is basically an average-- instead of being moving, it's anchored to a particular price-- could be a psychological event, a high, or a low.

And I like to anchor these for an IPO from the first bar of trading, then from the low, then from the high, and see how it develops. And we're seeing here price got below a little bit-- managed to get above-- maybe this was a short here, because this was potential resistance. But it didn't come down that much.

And then you see this volume spike-- you're starting to break out from this upper VWAP curve. And it breaks out really nicely. And so I found with IPOs and just about anything-- but especially IPOs-- that's a good way to approach this kind of work. JC, if you have any thoughts on Airbnb, happy to share them with us, or we can move on to Peloton, because I know you're tracking that stock as well.

JC PARETS: Yeah, no, I like Airbnb. I like the break-out. And most importantly, I like the break-out off the IPO high, right? So that's always a key pivot for me. Remember as technicians, we analyze the behavior of markets, liquid markets, and it hasn't been a liquid market very long. So there's not that much data.

But I have found that that former peak is an important one. Let's call it-- what are we going to call it-- we're going to call it 165. If we're above 165, we had a little failed breakout at the end of the year-- if we're above 165, that's the IPO high. I like it long. I think it goes to 192. That's the next level.

JARED BLIKRE: Got you. What about Peloton here? And I've kind of marked up the charts the way you had it when your slide looks. But just tell me-- this is another just building bases and going higher, kind of like Tesla.

JC PARETS: Yeah, that's exactly right. So this isn't, like, a new name for us. It was actually-- I think it was our biggest winner of 2020, I have to go back and check. But needless to say, it was a monster-- call options, the whole thing worked out really well.

Now, our target near 150 had been hit. We've consolidated sideways in a very healthy manner. And now I think it's ready to take off again. So if we're above 150, I like Peloton long. I think it goes to 232, that's where I think it goes next.

But if it's below 150, I think you leave it alone. So below 150, leave it alone. Above 150, I like it long-- pretty binary as far as I'm concerned. And like I said, I think--

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, it sounds like that you have a really nice reward to risk-- potential reward to risk ratio on that. Is that something that you look at before you get into a trade?

JC PARETS: Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, it's all that matters. You know, you can have all your conspiracy theories as to why a stock's going to go up, but at the end of the day, the only reason you're buying a stock is because you could think that you can sell it to somebody else at a higher price. If you didn't think that, you weren't going to buy it, regardless of who the president is or whatever ridiculous things you come up with.

At the end of the day, you're only buying a stock because you think you can sell it down the road to somebody else for a higher price. Now, you also want to be able to identify where you're wrong. So I don't really care how high you think it goes, I want to know what the market needs to do to prove that thesis wrong. And by my work, it's very well defined. In this case, the number is 150. If we're not above 150, the bullish thesis is simply incorrect.

JARED BLIKRE: Yep, got you there. I do want to get to a couple more questions here. We're supposed to end in just three minutes. We usually take a little bit more time, so maybe we'll extend this by a few minutes. My producers can tell me if I'm going way too over.

But here we go-- yeah, what about inflation pressure on stocks and real estate in 2021? I'll field this. Kind of macro look here-- inflation expectations have shot up. A lot of this has to do with the government spending more money. There's probably going to be another stimulus bill here. And all of that points to potential higher inflation.

Now, how does the Fed react to that? That's what you got-- and I know, JC, we were talking before the show, you said, you put in your contract that you don't get to talk-- we don't have to talk about the Fed. So that's why I'm taking this one.

JC PARETS: Oh, it's you.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. You know, inflation is usually good for real estate stocks. And you already have this boom we're seeing XHP-- that's the homebuilders ETF at record highs. And I think KB Homes reported after the bell yesterday tons of new orders-- $3 billion worth of new orders to be built in this year-- so anchors away for inflation.

And then we have, are government bonds a good bet for the next two to three years? I'll tell you what, we've seen over the last couple of months, and especially accelerating within the last few weeks, is that yields are going to the upside. They're breaking up, which means that bonds are selling off.

I don't know that bonds are the best environment, given what we've seen and the price action over the last couple of months, combined with the political agenda that everybody is expecting. Now, you have the Fed, which is probably not going to want those yields to get too high. So they'll put a floor on bonds. But we're not there yet, and nobody really knows where that floor is.

So we've got to look at TLT and the bond market, and it'll tell us when to get back in. Oh, JC, this is one for you. We are going to Miami on Friday, tell us where we should eat. This comes from Carrie.

JC PARETS: Man, I haven't been in Miami, like, in a year. And I don't even know what's open or what's not. You know what I do know is open-- Arbetter's. I used to work at this hot dog joint 20 years ago, 21 years ago, and they make the best chili dogs in the world. Go to Arbetter's, tell them JC sent you. They won't have any idea who I am-- been a long time. The kids there weren't even born when I worked there.

But if you want some hot dogs, I do know they're open, because I follow them on Instagram. But that's the truth, I don't know-- I don't know who's open. Sorry. I don't have time, you know?

JARED BLIKRE: You might want to check out Frankie's Pizza-- it's right by Arbetter's.

JC PARETS: Order [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] is open. Get some [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] and some [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. Have some [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. You'll be fine.

JARED BLIKRE: This makes me homesick here. All right, let's round out with a couple more questions here. We've got a couple of minutes. What's the outlook for video game stocks? Oh, golly, GameStop is just in a massive short squeeze today. And they sell-- this is more of a retail story, just kind of grabbed my attention. I'm going to put this chart up here.

So here's GameStop having its biggest one-day advance ever-- I got some Anchored VWAP lines. And just to show you-- this-- you know, stocks, if you look at Anchored VWAP as kind of an equilibrium point-- so you have a matching of buyers and sellers. They're at the same average entry price at a particular VWAP curve, well, you know, as soon as we got out of this one, which means that there were more people in the green than in the red, basically, since that prior high, we just took off.

And all it took was a little bit of news-- I think it was activist investors. But it doesn't really matter. As far as gaming stocks, I think, you know, a lot of them benefited from the work from home environment in 2020. I think it's going to be more selective.

The high growth stocks that we've seen, we're going to see some winners and some losers. Peloton probably one of those winners, but not everything from last year that did well during the work from home environment, the lockdown, I think it's going to be more selective this time around. Any thoughts on it, JC?

JC PARETS: Well, GameStop, like you said, is a major short squeeze. I mean, huge, huge short squeeze. If you're going to be looking at the video games, the Activision has already broken out above the 2018 highs. So that's the one I like. You guys who have known me for a while know for me, relative strength is a very important signal.

This one's showing relative strength compared to the others. So for me, if Activision is above those 2018 highs-- let's call it $85-- I like it long. For below $85, leave it alone. It's somebody else's problem. But above $85, I like it long. $112 is next-- the ATVI.

JARED BLIKRE: ATVI. I'm just going to take a quick look at that.

JC PARETS: Activision.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, Activision Blizzard here we go. So what were those numbers one more time for the audience here?

JC PARETS: I think $84, $85 is probably a good level, right? $85 to keep it safe. If we're above that, I like it long. Below it, leave it alone-- goes to $120-- excuse me, $112.

JARED BLIKRE: Gotcha. And yeah, with the candlesticks, you can see those support and resistance levels kind of baked in right there.

JC PARETS: Because the-- sorry to interrupt. The thesis is that we are now breaking out of a multi-year base, right? That's the thesis. That it's taken 2 and 1/2 years to absorb all of this overhead supply, and now prices can move on, because there's more demand than supply. If we're not above those former highs, we can't make that argument. It invalidates that thesis-- just so the viewers can understand the thought process.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. And in general, what I've noticed with the indicators that I like the most, they all have something in common. And that's that investors like to get out of break-even, to their detriment. So we're looking for equilibrium levels. And prices going above multi-year resistance, that could be one form. Anchored VWAP another-- and then even moving averages, I don't see them as powerful, but they kind of do the same thing.

All right, I want to thank everybody for coming today-- JC, especially. Really had a lot of fun with you, hopefully people know a little bit more about Miami. And check us out in three Wednesdays from now, February 3. That is our next webinar. And we are back to a monthly schedule, first Wednesday of every month.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Instead of shrinking from the world after he made his billions, media mogul Haim Saban jumped into the fray. The Democratic mega-donor has poured tens of millions into electing the party's candidates, becoming a top power broker with a special focus on policy towards Israel. Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the global kids sensation ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" which led to lucrative partnerships with Rupert Murdoch at News Corporation. Now, Saban runs the investment firm Saban Capital Group, with holdings in music, film, and real estate. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" he joins me to talk about the corporate backlash against Donald Trump, what to expect from Joe Biden's first days in office, and why the Fox-Disney merger left him scratching his head.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm Saban Capital. Hi, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week, with regard to the attack on the Capitol. Do you think that President Trump is, in some way, to blame for the siege on the Capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is in some way. In every single way he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been-- fomented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the Capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime, and he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone. That's what I believe. But apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason-- no rhyme or reason-- to have somebody who committed a crime-- to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the election, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they caught him off, like all the online entities cut him off-- Facebook and Twitter-- if-- outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media-- television media-- simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans, from birther all the way to inciting this group of Meshuganas to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuganas is Yiddish for crazy people?

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshugana is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so-- because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always have been divisions but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence, the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about-- they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OANN and the telcos, as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say, Congress people-- who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion. My opinion, you should go all the way, but my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point, Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of the, as I call them, the meshuganas, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and maybe a website here and a website there-- you cannot block everything on the internet-- but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult-- possible, very difficult.

ANDY SERWER: So Biden has a lot of things on his plate, though, Haim. He's got potentially holding Trump accountable. Obviously, the main story should be COVID, right? And then there's the business of confirming cabinet members. What should he prioritize?

HAIM SABAN: COVID, obviously, the economy, support for people who can't put food on the table. And as he said, he's going to do that. You know, he's-- he was very clear that he's going to do that. And knowing him well, he's a man with a heart. He's not interested in Biden. He's interested in the country, unlike Trump, who's only interested in Trump. Nothing else interests Trump but Trump, as he has proven over and over again.

So you know, he's going to have quite a few issues on his hand, whether it's Russia or China. That's on the international platform. And obviously, domestically, we all know what the issues are. So yeah, he's got a plateful, no question.

ANDY SERWER: Do you support the idea of giving Americans $2,000 checks as part of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package?

HAIM SABAN: Above my pay grade to, you know, quote an amount because I don't have, obviously, the full picture of the deficit level, how much more money can the government keep printing or not. So I don't have a full picture. But I'm fully supportive, in principle, for the government to do the maximum to help the people that need help. In principle, I am 100%, whether it's $2,000 or $1,500 or whatever that number is. It really is above my pay grade.

ANDY SERWER: Haim, tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.

HAIM SABAN: I say, baloney. You know, he's-- they say-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously, from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters, maybe he's a little bit left of me, but he's more of a centrist than a left-wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who is able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal, and I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again, there are so many avenues that he can take to address that inequality, but I am truly, in my heart of heart, 100% convinced that he is the right man to address that inequality. He's a guy with a heart. We missed heart over the last four years. We were all served by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us, one way or the other.

ANDY SERWER: You did say you disagreed with him on some things. What were those kind of areas?

HAIM SABAN: You know, I'm a security hawk. For example, I'm not sure that telling the Iranians publicly that he plans on going back to the deal before-- behind the scenes, letting them know what the conditions are to go back to the deal and, you know, offer some carrots in public and sticks privately. I don't think that there have been discussions directly with the Iranians.

Case in point, they're now, you know, increasing the amount of uranium that they have. They're increasing the level at which it's-- so we're seeing the Iranians, basically, despite all the rhetoric by Trump, doing whatever it is they want to do, and they don't give a hoot about what Trump, you know, puts on sanctions on them. Look at the disaster of results he got out of the deal, but look at the test of results. We're a lot worse off than we were before he got out of the deal.

So the bottom line is that I think that there should have been a different approach to Iran. Yes, of course, we all believe that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian problem, whether it's ballistic missiles or, you know, the uranium development, et cetera-- you know, all of these are a main issues. But the way they just-- out of the box, this new administration has said we want to go back to the deal, that's a little worrisome. What kind of a signal are you sending?

ANDY SERWER: Right. The president, as you said, certainly has his hands full on the foreign policy front, as well. I noticed that Kim Jong Un was rattling around and making some noise. And of course, he's still there running North Korea so no shortage of things for the President-elect to have to be concerned about there.

HAIM SABAN: No question.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Haim, and ask you about Saban Capital Group, which includes a company focused on acquiring and distributing feature films and another on music production. Talk about what the business has been like during COVID, and what do you expect during 2021?

HAIM SABAN: Well, traditional media, where we invested our monies over the last 20 years-- we're not a fund. We work with our own money. And we've invested in things like Univision. We bought the largest media company in Germany. We bought the incumbent telecom company and Israel, bought and then sold, and the same thing for Germany. Traditional media is no longer, in our view, an opportunity for private equity.

So we have switched our focus to real estate. We're a big-- well, everything is relative, obviously-- but, you know, we're a multibillion-dollar holder of real estate assets. We have switched our efforts to things like acquiring finished films and distributing them, primarily in the US and the UK.

And music is my first love. I started off playing in a band then I was a producer and an agent and manager. And I'm having a lot of fun with it. I love Latin music. Latin music is exploding. So I love working in the studio. Believe it or not, I go to the studio and work with the producers and the writers and the singers, and it's been a lot of fun.

We launched, about a year ago, our first record. We already have, between our four artists, more than 1 billion streams across different platforms. So we're on our way to have a successful music company. And for me, to listen to music at home and come up with ideas for the artists to implement and share it with them, et cetera, it's been a lot of fun. I love it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I noticed you got your start in music, and I want to ask you about that. I mean, first of all, I think you had a principal who told you you weren't a good student. You self-described yourself as not a terribly good musician. And yet, you've been so successful. So I'm wondering, what is your core competency? You know, what is Haim Saban really good at?

HAIM SABAN: Nothing and everything. Because really good is a very committing statement. So really good? Nothing. Pretty good-- you know, instinct this is a very important trait. And I have been blessed to-- don't get me wrong. I've made plenty of mistakes and made investments that didn't necessarily pan out as I was planning to. On balance, everything is great, but there have been mistakes along the way. And my instincts, in most cases, have served me well and in some cases, not so well. So--

ANDY SERWER: Right. Now, I noticed you have that guitar behind you. Is there any way you could play us a tune?

HAIM SABAN: There is no way because I think you mentioned before that I admitted to being a lousy musician. So I don't want to-- I am. But being a lousy musician, you can still be a great producer, by the way. And the millions of records I have sold as a producer, when I lived in France, is proof to the fact that I knew what I was doing. And you know, the beginning of the success that we're having here with our music company, which is one year old, you know, is proof that, you know, I have a sense of what people want to listen to.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, sort of like you don't have to be the best baseball player to be the best baseball manager.

HAIM SABAN: That's a very good analogy, absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And so just one more thing about this guitar playing on your part, what do you like to play? If you're not going to play it for us, then what do you like to play, what kind of music?

HAIM SABAN: I love all kinds of music. I love all kinds of music. My playlists include everything from classic to Israeli music, classic Israeli music, modern Israeli music, Latin music, pop. I admit that I don't understand hip-hop, so I don't listen to it because I just-- I can't get my arms around hip-hop. I just don't know what's good, what's not good, and there's nothing about hip-hop that's appealing to me, at please. But overall, any kind of music, you know, that pleases my ear pleases my soul. So that's how it works.

ANDY SERWER: Right. And let me ask you, is streaming helping or hurting right now? I mean, eventually, your acts would have to perform live at some point again, right?

HAIM SABAN: Well, realistically speaking, the numbers speak for themselves. 27% of revenue for artists come from streaming, unless you're a phenomenon like Drake or J Balvin. 27% comes from streaming, 63% from all other sources-- touring, merchandising, branding, and the like. And the 63% has been frozen.

But we all hope that with the vaccine, whether it takes another six months or another 12 months-- I don't think anybody has a true sense to put a date on it-- but it will come back. It will come back. And once it comes back, that 63% of sources of revenue will be back on the table, so yeah.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned real estate, which is curious to me because a lot of people would say, wow, that's not a good business to be in right now because of COVID. What's your thesis there?

HAIM SABAN: Well, there-- we are in a-- we don't develop anything. We buy yield, if you will. And we are in categories that have been COVID resistant-- GSA, which is government, as a tenant, self-storage, student housing, you know, manufactured housing. So I am, you know, very sorry for all those that have suffered from COVID in the real estate area, but we have been very fortunate to have been minimally affected-- minimally.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned Univision, of course, which is a deal and a company that you're known for. Where does that stand? You wound that investment up, correct?

HAIM SABAN: Well, we just sold it. We just sold it.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

HAIM SABAN: That was not a shining moment in my investment career, I must admit, because we have been, you know, suffering what all traditional media has suffered. Linear television, according to Bob Iger, the Disney chairman, in 10 years, will not exist. So very few people say, OK, it's Thursday, 9:00 PM. Let's turn on CBS and watch this show. That's not how people watch TV these days. So so many people don't-- especially in the younger generation, don't even have cable or satellite.

So traditional media, we have been one of the victims of the gradual erosion of traditional media. So hey, you win some, you lose some, right? So--

ANDY SERWER: It was--

HAIM SABAN: But if, on balance, you win, you're good.

ANDY SERWER: That-- yes. It was hard to see that coming, I guess. Is there anything you look back on now and realize you could have done differently with that deal?

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, I could have taken my money and put it in an index, and it would have tripled and I wouldn't have had to work that hard for 14 years. So but, you know, who would have known, 14 years ago, that, you know, traditional media would be where it is today?

ANDY SERWER: Well, I think it's great that you can laugh about it because some people would just say, I don't want to talk about it. So the fact that you've sort of processed it and let it go, to an extent, I think is a healthy thing.

HAIM SABAN: No, I let it go. I let it go. I mean, you know, it is what it is. What's important is on balance, what's our investment performance overall. That's more important, in my opinion, than any one specific deal. No one has nothing but wins-- no one, not Warren Buffett, not Bill Gates. No one has nothing but wins. You win some, you lose some, and that's OK.

ANDY SERWER: Only Bernie Madoff had nothing but wins.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: That should have made people suspicious.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, well, exactly. Thank God we didn't have a Donald with him.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Big tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, have been getting into original content, Haim. Do you think they'll succeed?

HAIM SABAN: If they decide, as a matter of a strategic, you know, goal, they'll have no problem because they have all the money in the world to buy the biggest talent in America. And by definition, when you're able to work with the biggest talent, you're going to have a huge success.

So yeah, eventually, yeah, it's just a matter of a strategic decision for the Apple of this world to say, OK, I'm going to be bigger than any other studio. OK, and I have $250 billion in the bank, and I generate billions of dollars of free cash flow. I'm going to do it. And they do it. So I think that it's only a matter of strategic decision for them.

ANDY SERWER: Another thing you're known for is ""Power Rangers,"" and so that brings me to ask you, what do you think future trends look like in the media business, both in terms of content, maybe, and in terms of distribution? How are you seeing things?

HAIM SABAN: Well, I'll speak to the kids business, and the kids business will always be there because every year, new kids are born. And interestingly enough, during this COVID time, companies like Mattel and Hasbro are doing really well. Their sales are up by double digits.

So I think that the toy business is not going away. Entertainment for kids is not going away. We have many more platforms than we used to have, obviously. Take one example of a show called ""Cocomelon,"" which has tens of millions of followers on YouTube.

And so I think that the kids business is going to continue flourishing, again, as I said, for the simple reason that new kids are born every year. So it's a no-brainer.

ANDY SERWER: When you have your content on YouTube, though, can you monetize that? Or are you just helping out Sundar Pichai over at Google to get rich?

HAIM SABAN: Sundar Pichai gets less rich than Sergey Brin and-- what's the name of the other one?

ANDY SERWER: Larry Page.

HAIM SABAN: And Larry Page. Yeah, they get richer than Sundar. He gets plenty rich, but they-- of course you monetize it. A show like ""Cocomelon,"" I am sure, has, you know, very broad merchandising campaigns everywhere. And they sell toys, and they can go on live shows, once live shows come back.

YouTube delivers significant exposure. They're pretty stingy about how they share their revenues with creators, but there's still quite a bit of money, if you're very successful on YouTube. And then all the ancillaries are there, so they absolutely-- shows like ""Cocomelon"" are making a lot of money.

ANDY SERWER: You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it-- I used-- I was on the board at the time of DirecTV. They bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion.

ANDY SERWER: Nice.

HAIM SABAN: So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem that we have worldwide, by the way. So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner-- or the Warner, I should say--

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

HAIM SABAN: --content that they bought, I think, was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

ANDY SERWER: And then Fox and Disney?

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized, it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big. So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized, you need more scale, both at the content and-- as well as the distribution level.

So when he identified the fact that, you know, there wasn't much for him to buy to-- and again, this is my humble opinion-- and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. Rupert is doing all right.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, last question, Haim, this show is called ""Influencers,"" and so I'm curious how you see using your influence on the world.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that is-- how can I-- well, first of all, I might have some influence outside of my household. When I walk back into my household, it's-- as Jackie Mason likes to say, I say, where should I put my jacket? You know, I don't have that much influence.

So on the world, I think that people who have been as fortunate as I have been just simply need to give back. This is how you can-- you know, identify weak points in society that you feel you can be helpful with, and just give back. There's no better feeling than the feeling of giving back. There is no more gratifying feeling than the feeling of giving back. And that's what my wife and I have been doing now for-- I don't know-- 30 years is just giving back to society.

There are some specific causes that are of interest to us. Like health and battered women are of great interest to my wife, the rape center and so on and so forth, the free clinic that carries our name. We are very, very sensitive to people's suffering, and we try to do our part.

ANDY SERWER: Well, best of luck to you on that front and in all your endeavors. Haim Saban, chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, thank you so much for joining us today.

HAIM SABAN: Thank you very much.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Instead of shrinking from the world after he made his billions, media mogul Haim Saban jumped into the fray. The Democratic mega-donor has poured tens of millions into electing the party's candidates, becoming a top power broker with a special focus on policy towards Israel. Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the global kids sensation ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" which led to lucrative partnerships with Rupert Murdoch at News Corporation. Now, Saban runs the investment firm Saban Capital Group, with holdings in music, film, and real estate. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" he joins me to talk about the corporate backlash against Donald Trump, what to expect from Joe Biden's first days in office, and why the Fox-Disney merger left him scratching his head.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm Saban Capital. Hi, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week, with regard to the attack on the Capitol. Do you think that President Trump is, in some way, to blame for the siege on the Capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is in some way. In every single way he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been-- fomented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the Capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime, and he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone. That's what I believe. But apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason-- no rhyme or reason-- to have somebody who committed a crime-- to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the election, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they caught him off, like all the online entities cut him off-- Facebook and Twitter-- if-- outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media-- television media-- simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans, from birther all the way to inciting this group of Meshuganas to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuganas is Yiddish for crazy people?

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshugana is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so-- because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always have been divisions but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence, the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about-- they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OANN and the telcos, as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say, Congress people-- who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion. My opinion, you should go all the way, but my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point, Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of the, as I call them, the meshuganas, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and maybe a website here and a website there-- you cannot block everything on the internet-- but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult-- possible, very difficult.

ANDY SERWER: So Biden has a lot of things on his plate, though, Haim. He's got potentially holding Trump accountable. Obviously, the main story should be COVID, right? And then there's the business of confirming cabinet members. What should he prioritize?

HAIM SABAN: COVID, obviously, the economy, support for people who can't put food on the table. And as he said, he's going to do that. You know, he's-- he was very clear that he's going to do that. And knowing him well, he's a man with a heart. He's not interested in Biden. He's interested in the country, unlike Trump, who's only interested in Trump. Nothing else interests Trump but Trump, as he has proven over and over again.

So you know, he's going to have quite a few issues on his hand, whether it's Russia or China. That's on the international platform. And obviously, domestically, we all know what the issues are. So yeah, he's got a plateful, no question.

ANDY SERWER: Do you support the idea of giving Americans $2,000 checks as part of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package?

HAIM SABAN: Above my pay grade to, you know, quote an amount because I don't have, obviously, the full picture of the deficit level, how much more money can the government keep printing or not. So I don't have a full picture. But I'm fully supportive, in principle, for the government to do the maximum to help the people that need help. In principle, I am 100%, whether it's $2,000 or $1,500 or whatever that number is. It really is above my pay grade.

ANDY SERWER: Haim, tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.

HAIM SABAN: I say, baloney. You know, he's-- they say-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously, from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters, maybe he's a little bit left of me, but he's more of a centrist than a left-wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who is able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal, and I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again, there are so many avenues that he can take to address that inequality, but I am truly, in my heart of heart, 100% convinced that he is the right man to address that inequality. He's a guy with a heart. We missed heart over the last four years. We were all served by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us, one way or the other.

ANDY SERWER: You did say you disagreed with him on some things. What were those kind of areas?

HAIM SABAN: You know, I'm a security hawk. For example, I'm not sure that telling the Iranians publicly that he plans on going back to the deal before-- behind the scenes, letting them know what the conditions are to go back to the deal and, you know, offer some carrots in public and sticks privately. I don't think that there have been discussions directly with the Iranians.

Case in point, they're now, you know, increasing the amount of uranium that they have. They're increasing the level at which it's-- so we're seeing the Iranians, basically, despite all the rhetoric by Trump, doing whatever it is they want to do, and they don't give a hoot about what Trump, you know, puts on sanctions on them. Look at the disaster of results he got out of the deal, but look at the test of results. We're a lot worse off than we were before he got out of the deal.

So the bottom line is that I think that there should have been a different approach to Iran. Yes, of course, we all believe that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian problem, whether it's ballistic missiles or, you know, the uranium development, et cetera-- you know, all of these are a main issues. But the way they just-- out of the box, this new administration has said we want to go back to the deal, that's a little worrisome. What kind of a signal are you sending?

ANDY SERWER: Right. The president, as you said, certainly has his hands full on the foreign policy front, as well. I noticed that Kim Jong Un was rattling around and making some noise. And of course, he's still there running North Korea so no shortage of things for the President-elect to have to be concerned about there.

HAIM SABAN: No question.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Haim, and ask you about Saban Capital Group, which includes a company focused on acquiring and distributing feature films and another on music production. Talk about what the business has been like during COVID, and what do you expect during 2021?

HAIM SABAN: Well, traditional media, where we invested our monies over the last 20 years-- we're not a fund. We work with our own money. And we've invested in things like Univision. We bought the largest media company in Germany. We bought the incumbent telecom company and Israel, bought and then sold, and the same thing for Germany. Traditional media is no longer, in our view, an opportunity for private equity.

So we have switched our focus to real estate. We're a big-- well, everything is relative, obviously-- but, you know, we're a multibillion-dollar holder of real estate assets. We have switched our efforts to things like acquiring finished films and distributing them, primarily in the US and the UK.

And music is my first love. I started off playing in a band then I was a producer and an agent and manager. And I'm having a lot of fun with it. I love Latin music. Latin music is exploding. So I love working in the studio. Believe it or not, I go to the studio and work with the producers and the writers and the singers, and it's been a lot of fun.

We launched, about a year ago, our first record. We already have, between our four artists, more than 1 billion streams across different platforms. So we're on our way to have a successful music company. And for me, to listen to music at home and come up with ideas for the artists to implement and share it with them, et cetera, it's been a lot of fun. I love it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I noticed you got your start in music, and I want to ask you about that. I mean, first of all, I think you had a principal who told you you weren't a good student. You self-described yourself as not a terribly good musician. And yet, you've been so successful. So I'm wondering, what is your core competency? You know, what is Haim Saban really good at?

HAIM SABAN: Nothing and everything. Because really good is a very committing statement. So really good? Nothing. Pretty good-- you know, instinct this is a very important trait. And I have been blessed to-- don't get me wrong. I've made plenty of mistakes and made investments that didn't necessarily pan out as I was planning to. On balance, everything is great, but there have been mistakes along the way. And my instincts, in most cases, have served me well and in some cases, not so well. So--

ANDY SERWER: Right. Now, I noticed you have that guitar behind you. Is there any way you could play us a tune?

HAIM SABAN: There is no way because I think you mentioned before that I admitted to being a lousy musician. So I don't want to-- I am. But being a lousy musician, you can still be a great producer, by the way. And the millions of records I have sold as a producer, when I lived in France, is proof to the fact that I knew what I was doing. And you know, the beginning of the success that we're having here with our music company, which is one year old, you know, is proof that, you know, I have a sense of what people want to listen to.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, sort of like you don't have to be the best baseball player to be the best baseball manager.

HAIM SABAN: That's a very good analogy, absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And so just one more thing about this guitar playing on your part, what do you like to play? If you're not going to play it for us, then what do you like to play, what kind of music?

HAIM SABAN: I love all kinds of music. I love all kinds of music. My playlists include everything from classic to Israeli music, classic Israeli music, modern Israeli music, Latin music, pop. I admit that I don't understand hip-hop, so I don't listen to it because I just-- I can't get my arms around hip-hop. I just don't know what's good, what's not good, and there's nothing about hip-hop that's appealing to me, at please. But overall, any kind of music, you know, that pleases my ear pleases my soul. So that's how it works.

ANDY SERWER: Right. And let me ask you, is streaming helping or hurting right now? I mean, eventually, your acts would have to perform live at some point again, right?

HAIM SABAN: Well, realistically speaking, the numbers speak for themselves. 27% of revenue for artists come from streaming, unless you're a phenomenon like Drake or J Balvin. 27% comes from streaming, 63% from all other sources-- touring, merchandising, branding, and the like. And the 63% has been frozen.

But we all hope that with the vaccine, whether it takes another six months or another 12 months-- I don't think anybody has a true sense to put a date on it-- but it will come back. It will come back. And once it comes back, that 63% of sources of revenue will be back on the table, so yeah.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned real estate, which is curious to me because a lot of people would say, wow, that's not a good business to be in right now because of COVID. What's your thesis there?

HAIM SABAN: Well, there-- we are in a-- we don't develop anything. We buy yield, if you will. And we are in categories that have been COVID resistant-- GSA, which is government, as a tenant, self-storage, student housing, you know, manufactured housing. So I am, you know, very sorry for all those that have suffered from COVID in the real estate area, but we have been very fortunate to have been minimally affected-- minimally.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned Univision, of course, which is a deal and a company that you're known for. Where does that stand? You wound that investment up, correct?

HAIM SABAN: Well, we just sold it. We just sold it.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

HAIM SABAN: That was not a shining moment in my investment career, I must admit, because we have been, you know, suffering what all traditional media has suffered. Linear television, according to Bob Iger, the Disney chairman, in 10 years, will not exist. So very few people say, OK, it's Thursday, 9:00 PM. Let's turn on CBS and watch this show. That's not how people watch TV these days. So so many people don't-- especially in the younger generation, don't even have cable or satellite.

So traditional media, we have been one of the victims of the gradual erosion of traditional media. So hey, you win some, you lose some, right? So--

ANDY SERWER: It was--

HAIM SABAN: But if, on balance, you win, you're good.

ANDY SERWER: That-- yes. It was hard to see that coming, I guess. Is there anything you look back on now and realize you could have done differently with that deal?

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, I could have taken my money and put it in an index, and it would have tripled and I wouldn't have had to work that hard for 14 years. So but, you know, who would have known, 14 years ago, that, you know, traditional media would be where it is today?

ANDY SERWER: Well, I think it's great that you can laugh about it because some people would just say, I don't want to talk about it. So the fact that you've sort of processed it and let it go, to an extent, I think is a healthy thing.

HAIM SABAN: No, I let it go. I let it go. I mean, you know, it is what it is. What's important is on balance, what's our investment performance overall. That's more important, in my opinion, than any one specific deal. No one has nothing but wins-- no one, not Warren Buffett, not Bill Gates. No one has nothing but wins. You win some, you lose some, and that's OK.

ANDY SERWER: Only Bernie Madoff had nothing but wins.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: That should have made people suspicious.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, well, exactly. Thank God we didn't have a Donald with him.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Big tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, have been getting into original content, Haim. Do you think they'll succeed?

HAIM SABAN: If they decide, as a matter of a strategic, you know, goal, they'll have no problem because they have all the money in the world to buy the biggest talent in America. And by definition, when you're able to work with the biggest talent, you're going to have a huge success.

So yeah, eventually, yeah, it's just a matter of a strategic decision for the Apple of this world to say, OK, I'm going to be bigger than any other studio. OK, and I have $250 billion in the bank, and I generate billions of dollars of free cash flow. I'm going to do it. And they do it. So I think that it's only a matter of strategic decision for them.

ANDY SERWER: Another thing you're known for is ""Power Rangers,"" and so that brings me to ask you, what do you think future trends look like in the media business, both in terms of content, maybe, and in terms of distribution? How are you seeing things?

HAIM SABAN: Well, I'll speak to the kids business, and the kids business will always be there because every year, new kids are born. And interestingly enough, during this COVID time, companies like Mattel and Hasbro are doing really well. Their sales are up by double digits.

So I think that the toy business is not going away. Entertainment for kids is not going away. We have many more platforms than we used to have, obviously. Take one example of a show called ""Cocomelon,"" which has tens of millions of followers on YouTube.

And so I think that the kids business is going to continue flourishing, again, as I said, for the simple reason that new kids are born every year. So it's a no-brainer.

ANDY SERWER: When you have your content on YouTube, though, can you monetize that? Or are you just helping out Sundar Pichai over at Google to get rich?

HAIM SABAN: Sundar Pichai gets less rich than Sergey Brin and-- what's the name of the other one?

ANDY SERWER: Larry Page.

HAIM SABAN: And Larry Page. Yeah, they get richer than Sundar. He gets plenty rich, but they-- of course you monetize it. A show like ""Cocomelon,"" I am sure, has, you know, very broad merchandising campaigns everywhere. And they sell toys, and they can go on live shows, once live shows come back.

YouTube delivers significant exposure. They're pretty stingy about how they share their revenues with creators, but there's still quite a bit of money, if you're very successful on YouTube. And then all the ancillaries are there, so they absolutely-- shows like ""Cocomelon"" are making a lot of money.

ANDY SERWER: You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it-- I used-- I was on the board at the time of DirecTV. They bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion.

ANDY SERWER: Nice.

HAIM SABAN: So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem that we have worldwide, by the way. So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner-- or the Warner, I should say--

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

HAIM SABAN: --content that they bought, I think, was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

ANDY SERWER: And then Fox and Disney?

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized, it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big. So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized, you need more scale, both at the content and-- as well as the distribution level.

So when he identified the fact that, you know, there wasn't much for him to buy to-- and again, this is my humble opinion-- and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. Rupert is doing all right.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, last question, Haim, this show is called ""Influencers,"" and so I'm curious how you see using your influence on the world.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that is-- how can I-- well, first of all, I might have some influence outside of my household. When I walk back into my household, it's-- as Jackie Mason likes to say, I say, where should I put my jacket? You know, I don't have that much influence.

So on the world, I think that people who have been as fortunate as I have been just simply need to give back. This is how you can-- you know, identify weak points in society that you feel you can be helpful with, and just give back. There's no better feeling than the feeling of giving back. There is no more gratifying feeling than the feeling of giving back. And that's what my wife and I have been doing now for-- I don't know-- 30 years is just giving back to society.

There are some specific causes that are of interest to us. Like health and battered women are of great interest to my wife, the rape center and so on and so forth, the free clinic that carries our name. We are very, very sensitive to people's suffering, and we try to do our part.

ANDY SERWER: Well, best of luck to you on that front and in all your endeavors. Haim Saban, chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, thank you so much for joining us today.

306,2021-01-14T09:05:56+00:00,Delivery Hero Turkey Workers Seek Precedent-Setting Unionization,"(Bloomberg) -- Hundreds of employees at the Turkish unit of German food delivery company Delivery Hero SE are working to get unionized, a campaign that could have implications for other online delivery operations.

“We may formally apply to be registered to represent the workers as early as next week,” Ali Riza Kucukosmanoglu, chairman of Turkey’s Nakliyat-Is labor organization, said by phone on Wednesday. The union is close to organizing at least 40% of Yemeksepeti.com’s 6,000 workers, a number that’s growing as the coronavirus pandemic boosts demand for its services, he said.

Most of the company’s employees work at food and grocery delivery and warehouses, and they’re seeking better pay and working conditions, Kucukosmanoglu said.

Yemeksepeti.com dominates the online delivery market in Turkey. A successful unionization could create a precedent for the online delivery industry, he said.

Labor organizations in other countries are also seeing an opportunity for further gains during the pandemic. Powerful unions and activist regulators in Europe have come down on online retail giant Amazon.com, which for years has mostly prevented organized labor from penetrating its employee ranks.

Yemeksepeti.com’s chief executive officer, Nevzat Aydin, declined to comment on the unionization push inside the company. Delivery Hero didn’t respond to an email requesting comment.

Berlin-based Delivery Hero acquired Yemeksepeti.com for $589 million in 2015. The company calls Turkey its most mature food delivery market in the Middle East and North Africa, though it doesn’t provide a country-by-country breakdown in its financial reports.

Delivery Hero is the world’s largest online food order and delivery firm outside China, and operates in about 50 markets, according to its website. The company employs about 27,000 workers.

308,2021-01-13T10:00:00+00:00,Media should ‘stop giving Trump a platform’: Billionaire media mogul,"Saban Capital Group Chairman & CEO, Haim Saban, joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the division in American politics.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the elections worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they cut him off like all the online entities cut him off, Facebook and Twitter, outside of Fox News, Fox News is a special animal within itself, but if all the other media, television media, simply don't give him a platform.

You give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans from birther all the way to inciting this group of meshuggeners to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuggener is Yiddish for crazy people.

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshuggener is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden, because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so, because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always-- always have been divisions, but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OAN and the telcos as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say Congress people who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion? My opinion, you should go all the way. But my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point of Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of, as I call them, the meshuggeners, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and there may be a website here and a website there, you cannot block everything on the internet, but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform, because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Influencers. I am Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm, Saban Capital. Haim, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about, and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week with regard to the attack on the capitol. Do you think that President Trump is in some way to blame for the siege on the capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is, ""in some way."" In every single way, he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been fermented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime. And he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress, or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone.

That's what I believe, but, apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason, no rhyme or reason to have somebody who committed a crime, to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the elections, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they cut him off like all the online entities cut him off, Facebook and Twitter, if, outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media, television media, simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans from birther all the way to inciting this group of meshuganas to go up on the Hill.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

AKIKO FUJITA: The DOW trading pretty flat right now in the afternoon session with the NASDAQ seeing the steepest losses. Amazon certainly in focus with other cloud services pulling those services from conservative platform Parler, Jared Blikre tracking that along with some other stocks for us. Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: That's right. And I want to bring in JC Parets, founder of All Star Charts. JC, I want to start with Amazon. It's kind of a hot ticker today. And we have a longer term chart going all the way back about one year from your slide deck here. Why don't you just take us through what you're seeing?

JC PARETS: Yeah. Well, I mean listen. Consumer discretionary is outperforming consumer staples which is consistent with a stock market environment where you're being rewarded for owning stocks versus shorting them. Right? If consumer staples, sort of the things that we need, beer, cigarettes, laundry, toothpaste, all those things-- I don't really drink beer or smoke cigarettes. My wife loves doing laundry. So I'm 0 for 3 of those.

But staples in general versus consumer discretionary where we spend money on things we don't need, essentially, is the-- right? So automobiles, retailers, home builders, things like that. Amazon is the biggest and the baddest. They keep changing it on me. I don't know. It represents like, I don't know, 20 something percent of the entire consumer discretionary sector.

So I do the reverse engineering, right? So the stock market's going to go up, S&P 500 to 4,500 which is where I think we're going, consumer discretionary in my opinion needs to be one of those leadership groups particularly relative to staples. And if discretionaries are going to go up and they're going to lead, Amazon can be making new lows, right? That's just math. So we're reverse engineering this trade. It's in an uptrend. Those are the types of stocks we like to own. If Amazon is above 3,000, I think it needs to be owned. It needs to be part of a portfolio.

Story continues

I think not doing that almost makes you short. By not having that exposure, you're essentially shorting Amazon because you're losing that alpha. Man, Jared, I think it's got 60% of upside.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, I don't want to be short Amazon right now for sure. But I want to check out the Shanghai Composite. Because we're looking at a 20 year chart. And I know you've annotated this as well. It's breaking to the upside. And how do you play this in the US?

JC PARETS: Yeah. Shouldn't be surprising. Most country indexes are doing just that, breaking to the upside. And Shanghai is no different. Listen, at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018 right before the stock market really sold off, Shanghai was breaking down to new lows. So we're not in that environment. It's the opposite. And Shanghai's breaking out Chinese internet, Chinese technology, and when Shanghai goes, when Chinese stocks go, they really go.

As you can see in the chart, when we've broken out in the past coming out of these bases ending those downtrends, Chinese stocks really go. So that's a space we like. And it makes sense globally, right? Consumer discretionaries, technology, communications, those three sectors alone represent half of the entire emerging markets index. China represents like 42%, 41%, something like that. So this is EM, baby. All day long.

JARED BLIKRE: Yep. All right, JC. Before we go, I just want to let everybody know that you and I have a webinar right here at Yahoo Finance this Wednesday a roadmap to trading profitably and consistently in 2021. Check out my Twitter feed for that pinned link to register. It's @SPYJared. And we are sending it back off to you, Akiko.

He launched his fund in 1985. According to Institutional Investor between 1985 and 2017, Chanos' short stock portfolio lost 0.7% annually. That means if you invested $1 million in Chanos' short portfolio in 1985 (keep in mind that Chanos is one of the most successful short sellers ever), your investment would have shrank to $725 thousand by the end of 2017. So, how is this an accomplishment? Why is Jim Chanos considered to be so successful? How did he become a billionaire by losing money shorting stocks?

The answer is relative performance. A short seller is successful if his short stock picks return less than the market. If the S&P 500 Index returns 15% in one year and a short seller's stock picks gain 10%, professional investors still consider this short seller ""successful"" even though he loses 10% of this capital. Why? Because short sellers don't just short sell. That's what Chanos did. His Kynikos Capital Partners is actually 190% long and 90% short. His net market exposure is really around 100%. Even though Chanos lost 0.7% annually on the short side of his portfolio, these short positions allowed him to lever up on the long side of his portfolio. Overall, Kynikos Capital Partners returned 28.6% annually between 1985 and 2017, thanks to its 190% long exposure which was enabled by its 90% short exposure.

Labeled as one of Wall Street's best-known stock pickers on the short side, Kynikos Founder and President, Jim Chanos sees a 'Golden Age of Fraud' in the speculative market. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said, ""They begin to believe things that are too good to be true,"" talking about the willingness of the public to 'buy' even if there is evidence of fraud laid out.

Aside from being Kynikos' Founder and President, Jim S. Chanos is an American Investment Manager and a Certified Investment advisor who is an expert in short selling and specializes in looking for legal frauds. Kynikos Associates on the other hand is an investment advisory firm that he founded in 1985.

""The longer a bull market goes, the more sense of disbelief erodes"". Chanos, like the other investors, assumed that 2020 will be a write-off. It certainly is easier to find good shorts in 2020 but for him, they're just not working. He said that there are companies that have large problems and are 'mind-numbingly' expensive but the market just 'does not' care about the facts. According to Jim Chanos, the 'zero-interest-rate' made it worse for the short sellers to make a profit. But he warned the bullish investors to not feel so 'relaxed' about the Fed's effort to help raise the economy. ""That's a very dangerous sort of place to be because you're completely counting on the Government to always make a you whole.""

Jim's short portfolio is intended to serve as an insurance policy for clients who want to hedge their own long positions. ""They're looking at the Fed as their insurance policy, not the marketplace. People are quite interested in fundamental shorts but then they shrug their shoulders and say, 'I don't really need it because the Government got my back"". For him, this kind of thinking is a very dangerous assumption for market participants to have.

""Normally, we're right about 2/3 of our positions and sometimes as high as 70% and I would say that the opposite has happened now."" He shared that just recently, they've been right on about 1/3 of their positions and wrong on the 2/3. For Chanos, the valuations in 2021 or even in 2022 would make no sense if we will value these businesses based on where they were in 2019.

According to Jim, there are people who believe in non-sense things for a very long time and he 'emphasized' that you must want to play with these people. ""You want to be in a marketplace and bet against people doing really dumb things with their money...Right now, people are doing dumb things with their money"". He marked that if you're playing properly, then you're going to come out ahead of other people.

Talking about tech stocks, Jim Chanos has nothing to say but purely positive reviews. He stated that a lot of bigger big cap tech stocks are 'pretty good' businesses. Jim Chanos mentioned Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as examples of tech stocks that get a very high return on capital and have high positive cash flow. He said that he would 'not' probably short some of those big tech names even if there's a possible regulation in place with the new administration.

""I think that the incoming administration is not going to be anti-market. I do think they probably will be tougher on bad actors in the market."" Jim Chanos thoroughly dubbed the current market environment as the ""Golden Age of Fraud"". He hopes that the new administration will toughen the cops on the beat and that will be a good thing for everyone.

Jim Chanos stated that the fraud cycle follows the financial cycle with a lag. People start to believe things that are too good to be true even if short-sellers and journalists are pointing out a fact pattern that would lead others to believe that there was a wholesale fraud going on. ""It's absolutely remarkable to me as to how many instances of outright fraud are sort of hiding in plain sight and investors continue to buy the shares of these companies because the companies themselves haven't admitted it yet."" He also said that these fraud companies 'outperform' the market until they admit their wrongdoing. ""That's one of the reasons why I think that risks in this market are much higher than people think."". For him, if people are willing to believe criminals until the criminals themselves admit the crime, then we have a very speculative market in place.  alert, attention, beware, black, careful, caution, clip, copy space, copyspace, crimes, cyber, danger, dangerous, defend, exclamation, fraud, guard, hacking, hanging, hazard, icon, identity, isolated, isolation, mark, message, nobody, objects, over white, overwhite, precaution, protect, rectangle, risk, safety, scam, sign, string, symbol, text, theft, triangle, vulnerable, warning, words, yellow

The prime example of legal fraud according to Jim Chanos is Enron, where everything they did was legal. ""It just depends on the magnitude of what the company is trying to pass off as legal under the accounting or regulatory rules."" He also mentioned that the recent poster child of fraud was Valeant Pharmaceuticals which went from $10 to $260 then back to $10 because it was able to convince investors that its earnings per share were $12 when in fact, they were actually losing money but still, everything they did was legal.

Jim Chanos marked that 30% of their portfolio is composed of companies they suspect to have legal or illegal frauds because they found something wrong with their financial statements. He explained that most shorts are caused by business model issues or business environment issues and not actual fraud. ""But now, we are actually seeing instances of fraud."" he proclaimed.

Speaking of Tech stocks, Tesla's EV is certainly the market leader right now but according to Jim Chanos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), 'also has a problem'. ""It's really a business model and valuation issue with Tesla."". Tesla is trading at half a trillion dollars at the time of the interview and it had a revenue of $30 billion but he said that there is something they do not want in their accounting. Despite what everyone says, Tesla will still be an automobile company that competes with other companies that make cars. Chanos said that 'Tesla is the stock where people pin their hopes and dreams'. ""For some holders, it's an EV company. For other holders its a clean energy company. For other holders it's an autonomous vehicle company... It's whatever people want to believe."" Jim then pointed out that, ""For the trailing 12 months, Tesla 'has not made' any money selling cars. Whatever profit they've shown, it's been very very low and it's from selling tax credits."" So despite the market leadership and the selling of 50,000 cars on average, they're still 'not'

making any money and if Jim will be able to meet Elon Musk someday, he'll say ""Job well done, so far"".  Tesla

""It's been painfully clearly but I will say for the first 4 years of those 5 years, it was actually not a bad short,"" Jim said that he still holds a position in Tesla. Despite these things that happened to Tesla, he mentioned that they were able to found lots of other things that are maybe even crazier than Tesla.

Jim Chanos also explained that in shorting, they use a percent of capital approach for risk management because if they use stop losses, they could have been stopped out from every single great position they ever had. ""Calibrating positions on a percent of capital basis for us has worked better,"" he admitted.

He was then questioned if Tesla is a good thing for the S&P 500 Index. ""A lot of people have bought the stock recently because its going into the S&P 500. I would want to point out to them that one of the ways to beat the S&P was to own Tesla over the past couple of years."".

Chanos said that 'they still like Tesla' but there are so many better stocks for them to trade now. ""Probably my highest conviction is an idea that will surprise the viewers. It's a company that nobody's heard of called IBM (NYSE:IBM)."" He said that IBM is a 'value trap' and they had a lot of success through the years in companies that looked cheap but have had structural fundamental problems. ""The company (IBM) we think, is still engaging in basically accounting high jinx. And it's hiding all in plain sight if you take a look at their numbers."" Jim added that IBM was supposed to earn $9 pro forma in 2020 but the actual number was just $6. He thinks that it's going to be only $5 dollars this year and $4 in 2022. ""IBM increasingly has engaged in lots of games to do this and the latest one is they're going to do a spin-off and now take a lot of charges, that they're going to ask you to add back as part of the adjusted earnings so that the actual gap earnings don't look so bad"". Jim Chanos said that IBM tried to do this thing about 5 years ago and they can only do this sort of 'illusion' for a short period of time. For him, we're in a period where IBM will sooner or later announce that ""we're not really earning $9, $12 or $13. We're actually earning $6, $5 and $4. And it's going to be the next reset."".  ibm, building, business, sign, wall, uk, laptop, tech fair, corporation, office automation, worldwide, international business, international fair, innovation, hardware, london,

As for commercial real estate, the reopening will be beneficial for things like hospitality and retail. Jim Chanos marked that commercial real estate peaked in 2018 and rents have been 'declining' ever since while the department store sales peaked in the year 2000. He said there have been real pressures that were happening in real estate even before the pandemic. ""The reason we're negative on real estate is due to interest rates and that cap rates in which people capitalize cash flows in the real estate business are back at all-time lows, meaning valuations on a dollar cash flow are at all-time highs."". He mentioned that this one is caused by the Fed's zero-interest-rate and because of people's belief that interest rates will never go up again. Jim cited SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) and Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) as examples of REIT's that backed down to the lows we saw in 2018-2019. ""The reason why some of these REITs are still lower is that the cash flows are down 30% YOY. And it's fascinating to us that people have sort of disregarded the cash flows were dropping before the pandemic and are going to stay under pressure because of oversupply of office space or retail space."". Jim thinks that the oversupply brought multiples back from all-time high to all-time low cap rates and it's the risk that investors have to take in commercial real estate. He is also certain that cash flows are going to continually decline even after the pandemic. According to Jim Chanos, there's going to be a 'very interesting opportunity' in the public markets versus the private markets in the commercial real estate since the need for office and retail space is going to be challenged as more retailers go out of business and landlords will be forced to cut rents due to the fact that the 'work from home' set up is now a trend.

Let’s now start to look at short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks:

10. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ)

Chanos had $972 thousand invested in HEDJ at the end of September. During the third quarter he boosted his stake in HEDJ by 113%.

9. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)

iShares focus more on the future term in order to achieve its goal to diversify globally and to seek long term growth. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and Tencent are among the funds' top three holdings as they try to beat their own annual return performance of 12.14% for the last 5 years.

8. Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV)

Jim Chanos had $1.1 million in XLV at the end of September. The funds' primary focus is to impart itself to be exposed to health-related industries, whether it be in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, or even in health care providers and services.

IVV was able to accumulate a huge 15.18% annual return for the last five years.

The holdings in XLV are composed of pacesetter companies that work on the Coronavirus vaccine. Their top three stocks are Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), UnitedHealth Group, and Merck & Co. Inc.(NYSE: MRK)

7. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)

Chanos had $1.5 million in IVV at the end of September. IVV's mission is to primarily be intact with large-cap American companies, where they provide cheap and tax-efficient access to these equities in their search for long-term growth.

This market index fund's top three holdings are, as expected, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). IVV was able to accumulate a huge 15.18% annual return for the last five years. As you can see Chanos isn't trying to fight the market, he is just trying to enhance his returns by shorting the overvalued stocks and reinvesting the proceeds indirectly into the biggest names in the market.

6. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)

Chanos had $2.2 million invested in XLK at the end of September. According to XLK, ""The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index"".

Known to be one of the most popular ETF that invests in large-cap equities, XLK focuses mainly to be part of the different technology-related companies in a more prudent strategy rather than the conventional way of investing.

XLK has achieved a milestone consistency of 26.72% annual return for the last 5 years, with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Visa (NYSE: V) as their top 3 holdings.

Long-term investments may look a little shaky. Which could make now an ideal time to look for short-term stocks to buy.

As I write this, the market is in a sell-off that could be happening for several reasons. Some investors are settling positions. The recent runoff election in Georgia will also have a significant impact on the monetary and tax policy of the United States.

However, you can’t ignore the novel coronavirus, which continues to vex society. The world was already dealing with a post-holiday surge in cases attributed to recent holiday travel. Now there’s news of a mutated, more contagious strain that is ensuring we all will be dealing with the pandemic longer than any of us would like.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But there is real hope in the form of a vaccine. And that means that there will be some stocks that may look a lot better, or worse, today than they will in a few months. Investors call these short-term stocks. In other words, stocks they are looking to hold for less than a year. In some cases, these may be stocks they only plan on holding for a few months.

10 of 2020's Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks

There are no specific criteria for these stocks. Investors can find short-term stocks to buy across all market caps and sectors. With that in mind, here are seven candidates to consider:

Simply Good Foods (NASDAQ:SMPL) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) Dollar General (NYSE:DG) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)

Short-Term Stocks to Buy: Simply Good Foods (SMPL) a delivery man in a red shirt dropping off a bag of groceries to represent food and beverage stocks

Simply put (no pun intended), the reason to consider SMPL stock is because it is the parent of the Atkins brand of meals, snacks and beverages. The company had a stellar 2020 fourth quarter that they reported in late October. A good bit of that growth came from the company’s acquisition of Quest Nutrition. But it’s the Atkins link that should have investors intrigued.

A new year brings with it resolutions. And perhaps no other resolution is more prevalent than the desire to lose weight. Holiday sweets can easily be replaced by Atkins snacks. Even though Simply Good posted a decline in Atkins sales in the fourth quarter, they did post a rise in digital sales. This suggests that they have a base of customers that have already become comfortable adjusting to their new normal.

Simply Good stock is down from its record high set at the end of 2020. The stock is looking a little overbought at the moment, but opportunistic investors should look for a chance to buy this stock on a dip.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Image of the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) logo outside of a corporate building

The year 2020 brought one record high after another for AMD stock. So it seems hard to believe that the chipmaker’s stock won’t take a pause at some point. For the bold investor, that could justify taking a short position in Advanced Micro Devices. And other investors may want to continue to buy and hold the stock. I’d recommend that approach if you already own it.

However, if you don’t already own the stock, the beginning of 2021 may present an interesting opportunity for short-term investors. Advanced Micro Devices hit its latest record high at the end of December. As of this writing, however, the stock is trading down about 3% from those highs. This could mean that investors will get an opportunity to buy AMD stock at a price you’re unlikely to see for quite some time.

8 Battery Stocks to Buy for Potentially Safer EV Exposure

David Moadel recently suggested that increasing competition may make 2021 a more challenging year for AMD. However, the long-term narrative for AMD seems sound. And that means short-term investors may have a short-lived opportunity.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida

Earnings season can present investors with an opportunity to take advantage of short-term price movement. And that may be the case for Walgreens Boots Alliance as one of my short-term stocks to buy. The company is expected to report increased sales of prescription drugs, which is why Forbes suggests WBA stock may have a valuation that’s more than 20% higher than its stock price as of this writing.

Walgreens continues to face significant challenges in the online prescription drug marketplace, not the least in the form of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That’s one of the reason it was among the worst value stocks in 2020.

However, as the immediate fear of the pandemic begins to ease, it should prompt higher sales of prescription drugs, particularly if hospitals are able to continue performing elective surgeries in the meantime.

And let’s not forget that value stocks are not likely to have another disastrous year, which bodes well for Walgreens. The company not only continues to pay out a generous dividend, but has continued to grow that dividend for 44 years.

Constellation Brands (STZ) Three bottles of Corona beer are arranged in a bowl with ice.

Another stock that may be ready to give short-term investors a lift after earnings is Constellation Brands. The producer and distributor of premium beer, wine and spirits is coming off a great year in 2020. Liquor stocks in general were a pandemic winner, and Constellation was no different.

Investors should also consider that the company’s ownership stake in Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) is still weighing down the company’s earnings. For example, in its most recent quarter, the company posted what would be considered a very modest 1.5% year-over-year (YoY) increase in earnings per share (EPS). However, if a loss from Canopy is removed from those results, Constellation’s YoY EPS growth would have been around 7%.

8 Cheap Stocks to Snap Up for the New Year

Constellation also pays a modest dividend. So for value investors who are hoping for a resurgence in value stocks, a company that continued to pay a dividend throughout the pandemic may very well be worth keeping on your radar.

Dollar General (DG) Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, midday

Staying with the value-stock theme, another of my short-term stocks to buy is Dollar General. The discount retailer was one of the largest pandemic winners. The company took what may have been seen as a gamble by continuing to expand its retail footprint even in the midst of a pandemic.

But in 2020 that strategy worked out well, because Dollar General was exactly where its customers needed them to be. And with an expanding online presence, DG stock looks poised to improve on the roughly 37% gain it made in 2020.

However, after posting solid earnings in December, Dollar General stock is in retreat. I certainly can’t explain it. You would think that with virus cases on the rise and stimulus checks hitting bank accounts, the stock would surge. However, the market tends to do what it will do, which presents a nice short-term opportunity to buy a stock that should continue to climb as long as the pandemic continues.

As of this writing, DG stock looks to be reaching a level of support at around $206. The stock looks like a buy now. And if the stock were to fall through this level, all the better.

Procter & Gamble (PG) A photo of a number of Procter & Gamble (PG) products.

In 2020, PG stock underperformed the broader market. However, this is a defensive stock that deserves a place in any investor’s portfolio. As the great toilet-paper shortage emerged at the onset of the pandemic, it simply proved the value of consumer staples. And Procter & Gamble is an undisputed leader in this sector. Their products are ordered over and over again and are agnostic to the way that consumers will choose to do their shopping.

And the company has a couple of other catalysts. First, the company has been expanding its market share worldwide due to expansion into additional business units. Another stimulant for the stock is the decline in commodity prices. For a company like PG, this reduces their material costs, which should increase earnings.

7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter

However, both of these may only give Procter & Gamble a short runway to outperform the market. However, that time would appear to be now. The stock has made all its growth in the last six months and looks to be approaching a level of resistance around $140.

The last on my list of short-term stocks to buy is T-Mobile. The reason for this isn’t due to 5G. Nor is it due to the likelihood that the economy is dipping into a recession, which will aid this defensive stock. It’s more traditional than that. After years of gaining market share, analysts believe that now will be a time for T-Mobile to start repurchasing shares, which will be a way of returning capital to shareholders.

TMUS stock should also benefit from expanding margins as it increases its operating cash flow in upcoming years. The largest question for investors is if they should wait for the stock to drop from its current level. The stock is at the upper end of its 52-week average, so investors may want to wait for a dip in the share price as an opportunity to buy the stock.

However, for those investors that put stock in analyst ratings, the company recently received a $140 price target from JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).

318,2021-01-08T18:25:02+00:00,Bed Bath &amp; Beyond 'seeing good early signs in January' despite disappointing quarter: CEO,"Wall Street may want to revisit its initial reaction to Bed Bath & Beyond’s (BBBY) earnings release this week.

Shares of the home goods retailer plunged 11% on Thursday after the company fell short versus estimates for its fiscal third quarter earnings and guided cautiously for the current quarter. The company pinned the blame on COVID-19-related traffic challenges at stores and some execution issues at the Buy Buy Baby kids brand.

Here’s how Bed Bath & Beyond performed in the quarter compared to analyst forecasts.

Net Sales: $2.618 billion vs. $2.747 billion Adjusted EPS: $0.08 vs. $0.19

But lost in the typical earnings day hoopla are several overlooked facts.

First, the turnaround at Bed Bath & Beyond under CEO Mark Tritton continues. The company’s same-store sales for its top five product categories surged 11% in the quarter. Together, these categories make up about two-thirds of the business. That performance is critical to see as Bed Bath & Beyond is paring nearly $1 billion in excess inventory from its stores to become a true destination for home goods.

These sales gains suggests shoppers are noticing the early work by Tritton to focus the company’s strategy.

Meanwhile, gross margins expanded 310 basis points from the prior year as Bed Bath & Beyond pulled back on promotions. Sales didn’t fall off a cliff as the company reined in its notorious coupons, a good sign. And lastly, the company told the Street sales in December were positive.

And they appear to continue to be trending well, Tritton told Yahoo Finance Live.

“We’re seeing good early signs in January,” Tritton said. Tritton added that guidance for the current quarter of unchanged year-over-year sales and gross margins may prove conservative. Upside to guidance is possible if consumers spend their new stimulus checks on home goods, Tritton hinted.

Shares rose about 2% on Friday.

Next up for Bed Bath & Beyond in terms of potential catalysts. The long-awaited launch of a barrage of new private label brands. Tritton is no stranger to such a rollout — he led the successful development of Target’s private label brand strategy as chief merchant.

Further, the growing integration of AI and Machine Learning (“ML”) with machines has made the robotics technology extremely dynamic and innovative, which, in turn, is bolstering the adoption of robots across major sectors, including industrial, automotive, electronics, healthcare, retail, agriculture, and food & beverages.

COVID-19 in Focus

The coronavirus pandemic has boosted the scope of robots. The automatic interactive machines are capable to address the manpower shortage issue, which has been one of the major concerns across many disrupted sectors, especially healthcare, amid the pandemic.

For instance, robots from UVD Robots are highly in demand in hospitals as they are very efficient for cleaning and disinfecting. This helps in reducing the spread of viruses and bacteria, thus, narrowing down patients and frontline workers’ risks of catching infectious diseases.

With the resurgence ofCOVID-19 cases, UVD Robots recently won a contract from the European Commission directorate-Generale for Communications Networks, Content and Technology for deploying 200 autonomous disinfecting robots in European Union hospitals.

We note that robots, especially cleaning bots, are coming mainstream and are likely to witness further traction in the coronavirus-hit world.

Growth Opportunities

We believe that robotics, as a field, holds immense potential in the days ahead, courtesy of continuous advancements in AI and ML, and improvements in machine vision and sensors.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global robotics market is expected to see a CAGR of 25.4% between 2020 and 2025.

According to an IDC report, spending on robotics systems and drones worldwide is likely to hit $241.4 billion by 2023, seeing a CAGR of 19.8%. Further, the report anticipates spending on the robotics system segment to be larger of the two categories, witnessing a CAGR of 17.8% over the same time frame.

323,2021-01-08T09:09:48+00:00,Hyundai Walks Back Confirmation It’s in Talks Over Apple Car,"(Bloomberg) -- Hyundai Motor Co. backed away from a statement confirming it is in talks with Apple Inc. on developing self-driving car that fueled an $8 billion surge in the Korean automaker’s market value Friday, saying instead that it received requests for potential cooperation from a number of companies.

Revising its statement for the second time in a matter of hours, Hyundai said it had been contacted by potential partners for the development of autonomous electric vehicles, removing any reference to Apple. Shares of Hyundai surged 19% after Korean media initially reported on talks with the U.S. company, only slightly paring their gains after the statement confirming discussions was revised.

By naming Apple initially, Hyundai risks the ire of the technology giant known for its secretiveness when it comes to new products and partnerships. With development work still at an early stage, Apple will take at least half a decade to launch an autonomous electric vehicle, people with knowledge of the efforts have told Bloomberg News. That suggests the company is in no hurry to decide on potential auto-industry partners.

Hyundai’s stock jump in Seoul was the biggest since 1988. A cable TV unit of Korea Economic Daily first reported the discussions with Apple, saying Hyundai completed internal talks on the project and is awaiting approval from the chairman.

Following the report, Hyundai initially issued a statement saying that it is one of various automakers that Apple had been in early contact with. The Korean company then revised that statement less than 30 minutes later, removing the reference to other automakers. A few hours after that, it issued another revision that omitted Apple:

“We’ve been receiving requests for potential cooperation from various companies regarding development of autonomous EVs,” the latest version said. “No decisions have been made as discussions are in early stage.”

Apple declined to comment.

The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker is notoriously secretive with employees and suppliers. In 2018, it warned workers to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the specter of potential legal action and criminal charges, saying in an internal memo it had “caught 29 leakers” in the previous year. In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company’s work under wraps.

Needs Partner

An Apple car would rival electric vehicles from Tesla Inc. and offerings from companies such as upstart Lucid Motors and established manufacturers like Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG. Setting up a car plant can cost billions of dollars and take years, likely the reason why Apple is talking to potential manufacturing partners.

“Apple needs to partner with a carmaker because it doesn’t have production capabilities and sales networks to sell its cars,” said Lee Han-Joon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “Building up those capabilities can’t be done quickly so Apple will need a partner for that.”

Bending metal is also a lower-margin business than providing the software, chips and sensors that future cars will rely on. Apple has continued to investigate building its self-driving car system for a third-party auto partner rather than its own vehicle, the people familiar have said, and the company could ultimately abandon its own vehicle efforts in favor of this approach.

Big Plans

Other technology companies seeking to expand into the autonomous driving space have also sought partnerships. Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving unit Waymo has worked with Chrysler, while Amazon.com Inc. has tapped Rivian Automotive Inc. for cooperation over delivery vans.

Many more alliances combining automotive and technology companies are set to emerge, especially after the coronavirus slowed down such combinations in the past year, said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at consultancy firm Carnorama in Tokyo.

Hyundai would provide Apple with a partner that’s already accelerating a push into new technologies such as electric, driver-less and flying cars. The automaker will spend more than 60 trillion won ($55 billion) in those areas over the next five years and in 2019 set up a $4 billion autonomous-driving joint venture with a General Motors Co. spinoff. It plans to release its first electric vehicle this year.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest companies that aren't profitable. People start businesses because they don't want to carry on with the 9-5 slog at best, though in today's world in most developing countries, 8 hours a day doesn't even come close to cutting it. And all this effort and bearing rush hour traffic throughout your life only to have to live pay check to pay check and the moment, say a pandemic hits, and businesses are closed and the next day you're out of a job and don't know where your next meal will come from. This what allures many people to start businesses, where the work is much harder but then you are earning money for yourself and not for anyone else.

This brings us to the main point of starting a business; making profits at a far larger scale than a simple standard working class pay check and working for yourself instead of anyone. This is why it seems counterintuitive that companies, especially major companies, could go on for decades while often making losses. Look, everyone knows that when you start a business, the first few years are not going to be profitable at all. This is why you need investment from people who will buy into your vision, and you slowly work on converting those losses to profits as times goes by and provide a decent return on the investment that other people have made in your business.

The best example of this, and perhaps the most extreme as well, would be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). From its inception in 1994, up till just a few years ago, Amazon remained unprofitable. This seems an insane thing to say about perhaps one of the most popular companies in the world and certainly one of the most influential but it is definitely true. The reason behind this is that Amazon, over the years, kept making sales at extremely low and competitive prices to entice customers to switch over to the company rather than whatever retailer they were initially going with. This has led to Amazon gaining a significant market share in e-commerce especially over the past decade, which in turn has led to economies of scale allowing Amazon to further provide subsidized prices to customers and gain even more share. This has allowed Amazon to also invest in other businesses such as its cloud service platform, which is one of the biggest in the world, and has allowed it to finally become profitable. Another advantage of the losses I mentioned earlier? Amazon now earns profits of billions of dollars and still doesn't have to pay income tax on it, due to the losses of previous years being carried forward and being set off against the profits of the current year, making it the biggest company in the world to not pay taxes.

However, Amazon is perhaps the exception to the rule rather than the rule itself. The goal of the vast majority of the companies in the world is to make money and make as much of it as they can to appease their shareholders. However, in a world which is as globalized and competitive as ours, even the biggest of companies are not exempt from making losses, even if their revenues are in the tens of billions of dollars.

Many of the companies in our list are state-owned, which is one reason why they are loss making. State owned companies main objectives surpass profits and include providing a service which is affordable to all residents, with the government absorbing the losses the company makes. However, it should also be noted that many state owned companies are simply victims of inefficiency and corruption, which is why they fail to make profits which I can say with confidence, being from a developing country whose state owned corporations are plagued by this issue.

To come up with the list of the biggest companies that aren't profitable, we considered the Fortune Global 500 list for 2020, which has the names of the biggest companies in the world. From this list, we took out the companies which made losses during 2019, and then ranked these companies based on their revenues, assets and employees, with preference given to revenues. Using multiple metrics allowed us to come up with an incredibly accurate list. It is important to note of course that this list is based on 2019 revenues, before the pandemic had disrupted the world. When we update this list for 2020, there will a lot more companies to choose from, as the economic downturn in 2020 has twisted the fortunes of the elite. But till then, let's take a look at the biggest companies unable to become profitable, starting with number 15:

15. Vale (NYSE:VALE)

Total revenue of the company in 2019 (in millions of dollars): 37,570

329,2021-01-06T07:00:19+00:00,U.K. Lockdown Paves the Way for a Supermarket Sweep,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the biggest British retail deal of 2020, billionaire entrepreneurs Mohsin and Zuber Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital were the surprise winners of a majority stake in U.K. supermarket Asda, valuing it at 6.8 billion pounds ($9.3 billion).

That augurs well for more supermarket mergers and acquisitions this year. Several other private equity groups considered taking control of Asda. They might now be tempted to put another U.K. grocer in their trolley.

British supermarkets have seen strong sales growth during the pandemic, as people have been forced to cook and work at home. December 2020 was their busiest month on record, according to data provider Kantar. And with the U.K.’s new lockdown in place, that grocery buying should continue. Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc, Britain’s fourth-largest grocer, said that as restrictions tighten, consumers have fewer spending alternatives and food sales increase.

Supermarket share prices also remain just below pre-pandemic levels, meaning a deal could be more affordable for a potential buyer. Some grocers have big real estate portfolios too, which private equity groups can borrow against to help fund a transaction.

Another prospect that might entice buy-out groups: Not only should grocery sales hold steady in 2021, but profits may also expand if supermarkets resist waging vicious price wars. With Asda’s new owners planning to raise debt worth 3.65 billion pounds to fund the deal, they will have no interest in slashing prices. Britain’s biggest grocer Tesco Plc likely won’t want to cut them either, as it recently sold its businesses in Thailand and Malaysia and is now more reliant on the U.K. and central Europe for its sales and profits.

But would exiting a supermarket investment be as easy for a private equity owner as getting in?

In five years’ time — a typical holding period for private equity — investors may be more enthusiastic about grocery shares than they are today. German discounters Aldi and Lidl probably won’t be opening as many new stores, making them less of a threat to mainstream grocers. Meanwhile, supermarkets should be well adapted to digital channels like online ordering and delivery. It’s not hard to see how a food retail investment could be offloaded through an initial public offering. Indeed, that’s the most likely route for the Issa brothers and TDR.

Alternatively, a financial sponsor could hold a grocer for the long-term and benefit from its steady cash flow. Or an owner could merge a supermarket with a higher-margin non-food retailer, such as B&M European Value Retail SA, as a way to boost profits. Such a combination would make more sense than bringing together two British supermarkets, since competition authorities blocked the joining of Asda and J Sainsbury Plc two years ago.

A couple of grocers stand out as promising targets. Tesco, with a market capitalization of 23 billion pounds, is probably too big. But that’s not the case with its leading competitors: Morrison and Sainsbury.

Morrison owns more than 80% of its stores and distribution centers. It had 5.75 billion pounds of freehold land and buildings on its balance sheet as of Feb. 2, 2020 — well above its market capitalization of 4.3 billion pounds. The group also supplies other retailers, including Amazon.com Inc., giving it scope to expand revenues faster than rivals.

Sainsbury, Britain’s second-biggest grocer, doesn’t have as much real estate backing as Morrison or Asda, since it owns only about half of its stores and distribution centers. But it has another feature that might play into a buyer’s hands: large shareholders in the form of the Qatar Investment Authority’s 22% stake and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s 3% stake through his Vesa Equity Investment group.

If a potential acquirer can persuade these holders to sell, it may be able to win over other investors and secure a deal. With a market value of about 5 billion pounds, Sainsbury is still pretty bite-sized for the big buy-out groups.

The ingredients are there for a U.K. supermarket sweep.

British supermarkets have seen strong sales growth during the pandemic, as people have been forced to cook and work at home. December 2020 was their busiest month on record, according to data provider Kantar. And with the U.K.’s new lockdown in place, that grocery buying should continue. Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc, Britain’s fourth-largest grocer, said that as restrictions tighten, consumers have fewer spending alternatives and food sales increase.

Supermarket share prices also remain just below pre-pandemic levels, meaning a deal could be more affordable for a potential buyer. Some grocers have big real estate portfolios too, which private equity groups can borrow against to help fund a transaction.

Another prospect that might entice buy-out groups: Not only should grocery sales hold steady in 2021, but profits may also expand if supermarkets resist waging vicious price wars. With Asda’s new owners planning to raise debt worth 3.65 billion pounds to fund the deal, they will have no interest in slashing prices. Britain’s biggest grocer Tesco Plc likely won’t want to cut them either, as it recently sold its businesses in Thailand and Malaysia and is now more reliant on the U.K. and central Europe for its sales and profits.

But would exiting a supermarket investment be as easy for a private equity owner as getting in?

In five years’ time — a typical holding period for private equity — investors may be more enthusiastic about grocery shares than they are today. German discounters Aldi and Lidl probably won’t be opening as many new stores, making them less of a threat to mainstream grocers. Meanwhile, supermarkets should be well adapted to digital channels like online ordering and delivery. It’s not hard to see how a food retail investment could be offloaded through an initial public offering. Indeed, that’s the most likely route for the Issa brothers and TDR.

Alternatively, a financial sponsor could hold a grocer for the long-term and benefit from its steady cash flow. Or an owner could merge a supermarket with a higher-margin non-food retailer, such as B&M European Value Retail SA, as a way to boost profits. Such a combination would make more sense than bringing together two British supermarkets, since competition authorities blocked the joining of Asda and J Sainsbury Plc two years ago.

A couple of grocers stand out as promising targets. Tesco, with a market capitalization of 23 billion pounds, is probably too big. But that’s not the case with its leading competitors: Morrison and Sainsbury.

Morrison owns more than 80% of its stores and distribution centers. It had 5.75 billion pounds of freehold land and buildings on its balance sheet as of Feb. 2, 2020 — well above its market capitalization of 4.3 billion pounds. The group also supplies other retailers, including Amazon.com Inc., giving it scope to expand revenues faster than rivals.

Sainsbury, Britain’s second-biggest grocer, doesn’t have as much real estate backing as Morrison or Asda, since it owns only about half of its stores and distribution centers. But it has another feature that might play into a buyer’s hands: large shareholders in the form of the Qatar Investment Authority’s 22% stake and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s 3% stake through his Vesa Equity Investment group.

If a potential acquirer can persuade these holders to sell, it may be able to win over other investors and secure a deal. With a market value of about 5 billion pounds, Sainsbury is still pretty bite-sized for the big buy-out groups.

The ingredients are there for a U.K. supermarket sweep.

331,2021-01-05T20:31:25+00:00,6 Video Games Stocks To Watch In 2021,"The video game industry saw major developments in 2020 with the release of new consoles from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE).

The sector also got attention as a winner due to the number of people who were at home during the pandemic. Here’s a look at what could be ahead in 2021 for video game stocks.

Sony Corporation: The PlayStation 5 had strong sales in 2020 and was the winner in the console wars battle. The story for 2021 for Sony could be the company’s exclusive titles, which could be among the reasons it won in 2020.

The company has “Returnal,” “Gran Turismo 7” and ”Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart” as console exclusives. Sony is also expected to release “God of War: Ragnarok” in 2021, which has been listed as one of the most anticipated games of 2021.

Microsoft: While Microsoft didn’t win the 2020 console war battle, it did make a large gaming-related acquisition with its purchase of ZeniMax Media. The deal gives Microsoft control of hit franchises like “Dishonored,” “Fallout,” “Doom” and “The Elder Scrolls.”

The studio will release a new first-person shooter with “Deathloop,” which is ironically a Playstation 5 exclusive timed release.

Microsoft will also release “Halo Infinite” in fall 2021, a highly anticipated exclusive game that was initially supposed to release with the Xbox Series X.

Activision Blizzard: Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) is rumored to release “Overwatch 2,” the highly anticipated sequel to the game released five years ago that is now a popular esports league. The sequel could increase interest in the name going forward.

The Blizzard unit could also have a huge 2021 with the potential release of “Diablo 4” for PC and “Diablo Immortal” for mobile. Blizzard’s latest release in the “World of Warcraft” series posted record-breaking numbers in 2020.

Story continues

Nintendo: Despite the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo Co (Pink: NTDOY) outperformed both stocks with a 60% gain versus 40% gains from the other two.

The company topped the leaderboards for years with its Switch console before the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

The Switch could continue to outperform in 2021 with exclusive titles coming like “Monster Hunter Rise,” “Pokemon Snap” and the potential sequel to “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.”

Immersion: With the PlayStation 5 selling well, one of the potential winners for 2021 could be Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR), the company providing the haptic technology for the DualSense controllers.

Several games coming in 2021 like “Returnal” and “Deathloop” are designed to take advantage of the haptic feedback in the controllers.

Amazon: A wild card to watch in the gaming sector for 2021 is Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company owns Twitch, a leader in video game streaming in the U.S.

The story in 2021 could be the release of “New World” in the spring.

The MMORPG from Amazon was one of three games announced back in 2016 and the only one to make it to the release stage. The success and reception of the game could influence how big of a focus Amazon puts on video games in the future.

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: Well, the health care industry has gotten off to a busy start in 2021. And that's leaving aside even vaccine development. First of all, we learned that the Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase joint venture, Haven, that they've thrown up their hands on that one. We'll get to that in a moment. But also an acquisition-- Centene agreeing to buy Magellan Health for $2.2 billion, which adds more mental health capabilities to Centene's existing portfolio of plans for Medicare and Medicaid.

Michael Neidorff, the CEO, is joining us now to talk through this deal and what's going on in the healthcare industry. Michael, it is great to see you. So as I mentioned, this adds mental-health capabilities to what Centene already does. And you talked about that, you know, medical costs can go up when you incorporate mental health.

This seems to be an-- an increasing trend in the industry, right, that you're thinking of the whole person, including mental health, when talking about health care. What does this do to the cost structure for you all and for health care more broadly?

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: I think there's a couple of things. So we've been doing it for a while, too. I think it's going to improve the cost structure. And we maintain the highest quality of care is the lowest cost.

And you think about this-- you have a-- and I've been using this a lot the last few days-- you have a newly-diagnosed diabetic. And as they leave the endocrinologist's office, you send them to a psychologist and say, this is what you have to do to deal with it. Life is not over. Here's how best to handle it. You're creating a much better situation with a better outcome. Long term, short term, that's lower cost.

But you start with ""what's the best possible outcome?"" and you always win. And that's what we've done all along. And I think this will increase our network, our capability. And I also remind people that Magellan has some disease-management capabilities, some PBM and other pharmaceutical capabilities that blend well with us. So this is something we've been working on for a long time.

Story continues

JULIE HYMAN: And do you think, then, that the broader industry is moving in this direction as well? Do you think that this means better health outcomes and lower costs across the board?

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: Well, I think others will start to do this. I mean, I-- we maintain that we want to be leaders. And I think that this combination and integrating the two, behavioral and physical health, is something that's very important. And as we do it, I expect we'll see more people follow.

BRIAN SOZZI: Michael, just-- I've been following your career for some time. And you have just made a series of large acquisitions and have really have made a name on pulling the trigger on things that I don't think a lot of your competitors would.

You know, how do you find some of these deals? And what is it about you-- how do you find some of these things ahead of others?

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: Well, I think we-- we have some very good bankers we work with. We spend time in industry. But I always tell people, you know, you have to-- you have to determine what you want to move to, not what you want to change.

And so we kind of maintain that in our strategic thinking. And as we see different opportunities, we move in that direction. A big orientation right now is technology. And we see some real opportunities there, and have beefed up our capabilities in terms of the people. And if you have a moment, I'll give you an example.

Precertification can take 18 minutes when a nurse looks at it. We now have a system we just tested in Florida, self-- self-developed, that can do the same thing with the artificial intelligence in 3 and 1/2 seconds. Now, if it's a denial, then I have a nurse and doctor look at it. Because you don't want to just depend on it.

So I mean, it's that type of thing we determine we want to move to. And then we start to look at, how do we get the capability?

- And then, Michael, I guess building off of that, you know, this-- that's an acquisition that outlines sort of how care has improved. But I just want to think about the business backdrop, you know, the cost of financing deals, the desire for companies to be acquired, the desire to do, you know, M&A from-- from your perspective as-- as an acquirer. What does that landscape look like to you as we come into-- to 2021, where rates are low, we believe we're early-cycle in the economy, and I think there's a lot of optimism around what the next couple of years look like.

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: Well, I think it's a couple of things. One, we-- we structured what we call Health Care Enterprises, where some of these startups and early-stage companies are in that. And it's very independent.

We're going to put Magellan in there so it's very independent. And Health Care Enterprises has as an outside board, outside chairman. And it's the CEOs really continue to run their companies. That has a lot of appeal to people. When they think about the fact that they can join our company, maintain it really as their company, use our balance sheet to grow, use our technology, it makes really a good mix. And it's-- it's working for us.

JULIE HYMAN: What is not working for another entity, Michael, that I wanted to bring up is the Haven situation, right, this JPMorgan-Berkshire-Amazon endeavor in health care. And it's really interesting, because there were so high hopes right when this thing formed, or-- and so high concerns among some competitors. What do you think that went wrong here? Or why do you think that-- that it was so hard for them to sort of disrupt the healthcare model?

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: I think it's a couple things. One, I have the greatest respect for the individuals involved. I mean, these are very bright, very capable, smart people that I always say, when I grow up, I want to be like. But I think, from the time it happened, I never worried about it. Because I didn't think that model, with the critical mass of the total employees-- let's say they had a million lives amongst all their employee base. Well, that's not really enough to get the law of large numbers working in this business.

We have 25 million lives we're covering, one out of every 15 American. We also now, with the acquisition, we'll be pushing 40 million lives we touch in some way.

They didn't have the systems. They didn't have the critical mass that you can kind of develop the network and contracting with. And it was obvious. And I think that was just a case of where they were trying to be a disruptor. I was applauding the fact. We need disruptors. And but at the same time, at the time, I told people I didn't think it was going to go anywhere.

JULIE HYMAN: So Michael, if we need disruptors, right, and especially as we come into the next administration, if you had sort of one big, ""pie in the sky"" disruption or change that you would want to see in the healthcare industry, what would that be?

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: Well, we are now talking, both sides of the aisle-- and they said to wait till after the election-- with a model. And I want to drop-- we're the largest Medicaid provider-- I want to drop it from 138% of federal poverty level to 100%. I want to bring those under 100% up with subsidies. And then I want to use the marketplace, and go from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level with the marketplace product.

Doing that, we're teaching people how to fish rather than giving them fish, how to use insurance. As they go above 400%, the subsidies tail off. It will the country $6 billion, our actuaries are telling us, to implement that kind of model. Very disruptive.

Because all of a sudden, now, you know, what-- who gets the Medicaid? Who joins the marketplace? It just starts to make insurance available. And there's a lot of-- there's other details I won't take time to-- to go in now. But I think there are things like that we can do, working with this administration, that will create real opportunity, but most importantly ensure that individuals in this country have access to high-quality care. That's what it's all about in my mind.

JULIE HYMAN: So you're not talking about Medicare for all, but Medicare for a lot more people than currently get it.

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: Well, it won't even be Medicare. It would be the marketplace, which is done through the private industry. Because I don't think this country is ready for Medicare for all. Single-payers, the only way to contain costs is withhold service. I mean, we have a large business in England. And we have 58 hospitals or something we're managing through some joint ventures, doing large business in Spain. And it's privatizing. So while they have the government programs, they're also using our program and signing up for it. Because they can't get-- the waiting list, the time to get what they need, is way too long. It won't work in this country.

JULIE HYMAN: It's always good to get your thoughts on this. We'll see what happens with this next administration. We'll check back in with you at that point. Michael Neidorff is the CEO of Centene. Thank you, sir.

MICHAEL NEIDORFF: Nice seeing you. Have a good year.

336,2021-01-04T16:20:15+00:00,Northern Genesis SPAC Rallies On Lion Electric-Amazon Deal Confirmation,"Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp (NYSE: NGA) shares are rallying on news the company has a deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) for electric vehicles and an equity stake.

What Happened: Lion Electric is set to go public with SPAC Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. The company issued an SEC filing last week that showed the company has a deal in place with Amazon.

The filing calls for the purchase of up to 2,500 Lion 6 and Lion 8 electric trucks from Lion Electric. Amazon Logistics is listed as the specified customer after being unnamed in previous Northern Genesis filings.

Under the terms of the deal, Lion Electric is required to reserve a portion of its manufacturing capacity for up to 500 trucks per year from 2021 to 2025. The deal calls for Lion Electric to provide the greater of 500 trucks per year of 10% of manufacturing capacity from 2026 to 2030.

Lion Electric will also provide maintenance and training to Amazon.

Why It’s Important: Lion Electric had previously signed a deal with Amazon for 10 Lion 6 trucks and has delivered two.

The SEC filing includes an option for Amazon to purchase common shares of Lion Electric at $5.66 and warrants to purchase shares at $23.36. The full vesting of the warrants requires spending by Amazon of at least $1.1 billion annually. Amazon could own 20% of Lion Electric in the future with its ownership options.

As part of the deal, Amazon is not required to purchase a “specified minimum quantity of vehicles from Lion” other than the existing purchase order.

Lion Electric said it had 300 purchase orders for up to 6,000 vehicles at the time of its SPAC merger announcement. The company sees 2021 revenue hitting $204 million from 650 units sold and 2023 revenue hitting $1.67 billion from 7,580 units sold.

NGA Price Action: Shares of Northern Genesis were up more than 12% in early Monday trading.

Credit for that, retail experts say, goes to years of mismanagement that put J.C. Penney in a terrible position to play in the digital shopping movement that was well underway before the pandemic. It’s a movement that has only gotten stronger during the COVID-19 health crisis, shifting billions of dollars in consumer sales to strong retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and Amazon (AMZN). In turn, extra stress has been placed on the business models of ill-prepared retailers such as J.C. Penney.

Will J.C. Penney survive? “Probably not,” Forrester retail analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday.

Adds Kodali, “J.C. Penney has been on life support for years now. It has just been on a steady slide down, and it has very, very little chance of recovery. It’s not in great real estate locations and it’s not well off financially. It has no brand resonance with consumers and it’s just not well positioned for the future.”

‘What is shocking is that it is still alive’

Add to the list of concerns it doesn’t have a strong retail CEO anymore, either.

J.C. Penney’s new owners — mall kingpins Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management — gave CEO Jill Soltau the boot this week about a month into its post bankruptcy life. Soltau’s replacement as of Jan. 1 is Stanley Shashoua, Simon Property’s chief investment officer.

Soltau was brought into save J.C. Penney in October 2018 after a successful stint leading crafts retailer Jo-Ann Stores. A woman walks by a JC Penney store that was temporarily closed on the day the company filed for bankruptcy protection and announced it would be closing some of its 800 stores amid the coronavirus crisis and ongoing debt problems.

Unfortunately for Soltau, her tenure was more talk than action. Burdened by billions in debt and a plunging stock price, Soltau was unable to get her turnaround plan into high gear. In fact, most analysts on the Street that covered J.C. Penney say Soltau’s turnaround plan — mostly focused on light touch-ups to the visuals of the stores and reducing inventory — was never going to truly drive a sustainable recovery for the company.

Story continues

The stock fell below $1 some two months after she got the job. J.C. Penney produced 10 quarters of net losses under Soltau’s watch, and entered bankruptcy in May.

Now the fate of J.C. Penney is in the hands of Simon Property and Brookfield. It remains unclear what their intentions are for the beleaguered chain other than to feed it money for now to keep the lights on so key anchor locations don’t go dark and scare away customers to the mall. The other option could be to slowly wind the chain down and rent out or sell the locations to Amazon for distribution space.

Analysts expect more J.C. Penney store closures to emerge in early 2021 after a likely dismal holiday season.

“What is shocking is that it is still alive and that it has not dived through the course of the pandemic. I think if anything, that’s a lesson in how resilient retailers are and how hard it is to really kill a retailer,” Kodali says.

343,2020-12-29T12:00:20+00:00,"Retail’s Boom-and-Bust 2020, in 10 Charts","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic delivered a core-shaking shock to the consumer-goods industry, abruptly reshaping what people were buying where they were buying, and how they were buying. For some companies, it has led to deep damage that is still fully revealing itself. For others, it has created opportunity.

As 2020 comes to close, it’s worth reflecting on these changes and where they have left the sector heading into 2021. Here, 10 charts tell the tale:

Toilet paper on a roll. As the reality of the pandemic came into focus for consumers in mid-March, the grocery business was gripped by a wave of pantry-loading that resulted in massive spikes in sales of certain products — and eventually, empty shelves. In a single week in March, sales of liquid hand soap soared 320% from a year earlier, while purchases of frozen meat climbed 132% and sales of toilet paper surged 236%. Hand sanitizer, meanwhile, was in such demand that year-over-year sales skyrocketed more than 1,000% in each week from early May to early July. Such extraordinary jolts of buying fever scrambled the consumer products industry, with brands taking steps such as bringing on third-party manufacturing partners and dropping less popular items to focus on the production of top sellers. Although demand has retreated from the frenzy of the early days of the pandemic, sales of consumer packaged goods have still held above last year’s levels. With widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines months away and many people still spending a large chunk of their time at home, strong sales in this category are likely to continue.

Online grocery carts fill up. Before the pandemic, grocery was something of a final frontier in e-commerce, remaining mostly untouched by retail’s digital transformation. Even though supermarkets and big-box stores were able to stay open throughout spring lockdowns, masses of shoppers decided to try online grocery shopping — include curbside pickup — for the first time or began doing more of it as a safety precaution. Some consumers will go back to their old, store-centric routine after the crisis is over, but many will stick to their new shopping habits. Years from now, this will be remembered as a tipping point for adoption, and one that significantly altered the showdown between Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Kroger Co.

Story continues

Big tickets. As customers adhered to social-distancing guidelines, they packed their spending into a limited number of stock-up trips and skipped the in-between, fill-in stops. This behavior is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the results of Walmart’s U.S. business, where declines in transactions, a proxy for traffic, have been more than offset by a boom in ticket, or the average amount spent per order. Relatedly, this unusual year brought changes in conversion, or the rate at which shoppers go from browsing to buying. When consumers set foot in a store in this environment, their intent to buy something was quite strong. That’s why, for example, there was such a disparity in the decrease in foot traffic recorded over Black Friday weekend — down 42% from last year, according to RetailNext — and the drop in brick-and-mortar sales, which was only 24%.

Stuff Rules. Millions of Americans lost their jobs or experienced economic hardship because of the pandemic, a dynamic that threatened to decimate retailers’ sales. That’s not how things played out, though. While some consumers have moved to the sidelines amid the economic gloom, others are redirecting the dollars they might once have spent on plane tickets, hotel stays or movie tickets toward retailers, perhaps to buy a new big-screen TV or home-gym equipment. The fact that consumers have had so few options for spending on experiences has made the retail industry’s recovery easier. The tables will likely turn when vaccines are distributed widely and pent-up demand for travel and other services is unleashed.

Spending Shift. Social distancing and lockdowns rearranged our lifestyles and in doing so, rechanneled our demand. The result: sales for some products froze up and caught fire for others. It was a bleak year, of course, for purchases of dressy clothes and lipstick. But there was softness in less-obvious places, too: ConAgra Brands Inc. said demand for edible seeds declined when baseball seasons were canceled, while Mondelez International Inc. said chewing-gum sales fell as social outings dwindled. At the same time, the pandemic acted as rocket fuel for sales of a wide array of products, including frozen foods, massage appliances, Crocs, printers, mattresses, snowshoes, rice cookers, bicycles and hair masks. Among the most notable beneficiaries of stay-at-home living are the twin empires of the home-improvement business, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., which each pulled in more than a year’s worth of sales growth in the third quarter after having achieved similarly gangbusters growth in the previous three-month period. Commerce Department data show what a banner year it was for these types of stores as consumers created home offices or splurged on palatial patios.

The Zoom phenomenon. Amid the aforementioned category-level shift in spending, some consumer brands emerged as breakout stars among investors much as Zoom Video Communications Inc. did with the surge in remote working. Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. boomed more than 436% this year as orders piled up for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills. Etsy Inc. was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index for part of this year as shoppers thronged the site in search of face masks. (Etsy ceded the top spot to Tesla Inc. when the electric-car maker joined the index this month. ) After sinking in late March, shares of Yeti Holdings Inc. have soared, now up more than 100% year to date, as investors realized its coolers and thermoses would be in high demand as people spent more time outside. It could be a challenge for these social-distance-friendly stocks to keep investors happy in 2021 as they lap the strong results delivered in 2020 and as more widely available vaccines may yet again change consumer spending patterns.

Storefront shakeout. Lockdowns and capacity restrictions at physical stores created a sales convulsion from which many chains have struggled to recover. The situation hastened the journey of already-fragile retailers J. Crew Group, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney Co. into bankruptcy in the first half of the year. That was only the beginning: Others including Sur La Table and Stein Mart liquidated stores after filing for protection from creditors. Even chains not in bankruptcy court were forced to reassess, with Nordstrom Inc., for example, announcing 16 stores would be permanently shuttered after initial lockdowns. Bankruptcies and store closings reverberate throughout the industry in varied ways. They represent an opportunity for healthier competitors to pick up market share. But closings also sprinkle malls with empty storefronts that threaten to make those centers less viable over the long haul. CoStar Group estimates that more than 11,000 store closings were announced this year through Dec. 1.

Rough run for workers. The arrival of the pandemic scrambled the retail industry’s large labor force. Workers at nonessential retailers were, in many cases, furloughed or out of a job, while others suddenly found themselves on the front lines of a dangerous public-health situation. Big chains offered hazard pay and bonuses in response to the circumstances, but in some cases, the measures felt insufficiently generous considering the explosive sales growth a given retailer was enjoying or the share buybacks it was undertaking. Dollar General Corp. expects to devote $2.5 billion to share repurchases this fiscal year, a figure that, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, is 14 times what it has pledged for pandemic-related compensation. Overall, despite big hiring sprees by the likes of Kroger and Walmart, retail employment has not returned to its pre-pandemic level.

Dining devastation. The pandemic has taken a toll on the restaurant industry, with a staggering 110,000 restaurants closing amid capacity restrictions and increased dining at home, according to the National Restaurant Association. The pain has not been shared equally, though. Work-from-home arrangements have been hard on the likes of Starbucks Corp., whose cafes are prolific in dense urban areas that have been empty of office workers for much of the year. Casual eateries, which rely on packed dining rooms that are either disallowed by local regulation or are simply undesirable right now, remain in a deep sales hole. That contrasts with the relatively quick recovery made by the fast-food segment since the early days of the pandemic. McDonald’s Corp., for instance, returned to comparable sales growth in the U.S. by the third quarter, helped by its drive-through windows and well-established carryout options.

Paying the price. This year presented retailers with unique conditions to wield pricing power. This showed up in a number of ways. For one, upscale clothing and accessories titans Ralph Lauren Corp., Capri Holdings Inc. and Tapestry Inc. were able to pad their gross margins by keeping the lid on promotions. But the clearest examples of price insensitivity were in the grocery business, where revenue exploded for reasons more complex than that people were eating more at home. In some cases, shoppers traded up to fancier labels, likely reflecting a desire to treat themselves in a lonely time. In others, stores and brands cut back on promotions and, in some cases, raised prices amid strong demand, contributing to a year of roaring sales growth.

As retailers plan their businesses for 2021, their most difficult work will be figuring out which of these new patterns are likely to last beyond the pandemic. That is an exceedingly difficult task and will likely result in some instances of bloated inventory, mismatched manufacturing capacity and frustrated consumers. At least it won’t be 2020 anymore.

At the same time, the pandemic acted as rocket fuel for sales of a wide array of products, including frozen foods, massage appliances, Crocs, printers, mattresses, snowshoes, rice cookers, bicycles and hair masks. Among the most notable beneficiaries of stay-at-home living are the twin empires of the home-improvement business, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., which each pulled in more than a year’s worth of sales growth in the third quarter after having achieved similarly gangbusters growth in the previous three-month period. Commerce Department data show what a banner year it was for these types of stores as consumers created home offices or splurged on palatial patios.

The Zoom phenomenon. Amid the aforementioned category-level shift in spending, some consumer brands emerged as breakout stars among investors much as Zoom Video Communications Inc. did with the surge in remote working. Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. boomed more than 436% this year as orders piled up for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills. Etsy Inc. was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index for part of this year as shoppers thronged the site in search of face masks. (Etsy ceded the top spot to Tesla Inc. when the electric-car maker joined the index this month. ) After sinking in late March, shares of Yeti Holdings Inc. have soared, now up more than 100% year to date, as investors realized its coolers and thermoses would be in high demand as people spent more time outside. It could be a challenge for these social-distance-friendly stocks to keep investors happy in 2021 as they lap the strong results delivered in 2020 and as more widely available vaccines may yet again change consumer spending patterns.

Storefront shakeout. Lockdowns and capacity restrictions at physical stores created a sales convulsion from which many chains have struggled to recover. The situation hastened the journey of already-fragile retailers J. Crew Group, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney Co. into bankruptcy in the first half of the year. That was only the beginning: Others including Sur La Table and Stein Mart liquidated stores after filing for protection from creditors. Even chains not in bankruptcy court were forced to reassess, with Nordstrom Inc., for example, announcing 16 stores would be permanently shuttered after initial lockdowns. Bankruptcies and store closings reverberate throughout the industry in varied ways. They represent an opportunity for healthier competitors to pick up market share. But closings also sprinkle malls with empty storefronts that threaten to make those centers less viable over the long haul. CoStar Group estimates that more than 11,000 store closings were announced this year through Dec. 1.

Rough run for workers. The arrival of the pandemic scrambled the retail industry’s large labor force. Workers at nonessential retailers were, in many cases, furloughed or out of a job, while others suddenly found themselves on the front lines of a dangerous public-health situation. Big chains offered hazard pay and bonuses in response to the circumstances, but in some cases, the measures felt insufficiently generous considering the explosive sales growth a given retailer was enjoying or the share buybacks it was undertaking. Dollar General Corp. expects to devote $2.5 billion to share repurchases this fiscal year, a figure that, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, is 14 times what it has pledged for pandemic-related compensation. Overall, despite big hiring sprees by the likes of Kroger and Walmart, retail employment has not returned to its pre-pandemic level.

Dining devastation. The pandemic has taken a toll on the restaurant industry, with a staggering 110,000 restaurants closing amid capacity restrictions and increased dining at home, according to the National Restaurant Association. The pain has not been shared equally, though. Work-from-home arrangements have been hard on the likes of Starbucks Corp., whose cafes are prolific in dense urban areas that have been empty of office workers for much of the year. Casual eateries, which rely on packed dining rooms that are either disallowed by local regulation or are simply undesirable right now, remain in a deep sales hole. That contrasts with the relatively quick recovery made by the fast-food segment since the early days of the pandemic. McDonald’s Corp., for instance, returned to comparable sales growth in the U.S. by the third quarter, helped by its drive-through windows and well-established carryout options.

Paying the price. This year presented retailers with unique conditions to wield pricing power. This showed up in a number of ways. For one, upscale clothing and accessories titans Ralph Lauren Corp., Capri Holdings Inc. and Tapestry Inc. were able to pad their gross margins by keeping the lid on promotions. But the clearest examples of price insensitivity were in the grocery business, where revenue exploded for reasons more complex than that people were eating more at home. In some cases, shoppers traded up to fancier labels, likely reflecting a desire to treat themselves in a lonely time. In others, stores and brands cut back on promotions and, in some cases, raised prices amid strong demand, contributing to a year of roaring sales growth.

As retailers plan their businesses for 2021, their most difficult work will be figuring out which of these new patterns are likely to last beyond the pandemic. That is an exceedingly difficult task and will likely result in some instances of bloated inventory, mismatched manufacturing capacity and frustrated consumers. At least it won’t be 2020 anymore.

345,2020-12-28T21:34:41+00:00,Analyst: 'Wonder Woman 1984' shows consumers eager to head back to the movies despite streaming threat,"“Wonder Woman 1984” (T) is giving theater chains a much needed boost of confidence.

The sequel, which debuted in approximately 2,150 theater locations across the U.S. on Christmas day but received lackluster viewer reviews, grossed $16.7 million domestically in its opening weekend — far exceeding expectations.

Even with the downbeat reception, the results solidified the Amazon princess’ second adventure as the best performing film opening of the COVID-era — a tumultuous time period which saw even Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” fall flat with viewers. The latter only generated about $9 million during its Labor Day weekend debut this year. “Tenet” only generated about $9 million during its domestic box office debut this year whereas “Wonder Woman 1984” brought in 16.7 million

However, theater markets in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco still remain shut down as COVID-19 surges nationwide.

With operations still facing 50% capacity limits across the U.S., “we estimate the $16.7M opening for ‘WW84’ could actually equate to as much as $110M - $120M box office opening under normal circumstances,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Eric Wold wrote in a recent note shared with Yahoo Finance.

“The original ‘Wonder Woman’ released in 2017 generated $103M in opening weekend box office,” according to Wold. In fact, Warner Brothers has enough confidence in the franchise to begin fast-tracking a third installment, according to the media giant.

“We believe this helps support the thesis that when consumers are allowed back to theaters with attractive content, they will once again become moviegoers — with the industry having the potential to begin returning to normal in 2022,” the analyst added. ""Wonder Woman 1984"" success proves that consumers will once again become moviegoers, according to one analyst

Warner Bros. released the superhero flick in theaters the same day it debuted on the studio’s fledging streaming platform HBO Max. Earlier this month, the studio shocked the media landscape by announcing plans to air all of its 2021 movies this way.

The hybrid release strategy was immediately met with scrutiny from major theater chains, with AMC (AMC) saying Warner was sacrificing profitability in order to “subsidize its HBO Max start up.”

Story continues

Although specific HBO Max numbers have not yet been released, WarnerMedia said nearly half of all paying subscribers tuned in to watch the film on its first day — with the platform setting a single-day record for downloads of its mobile app.

But the successful turnout still doesn’t mean consumers wouldn’t have preferred the big screen under a different set of circumstances.

According to Wold, “the decision made by HBO Max subscribers to watch ‘WW84’ at home was more of a decision made for them by local theaters being closed and stay-at-home restrictions, as opposed to the preferred way to watch blockbuster films going forward.”

With so much on the line, “we believe Warner Bros. is more likely than not to reverse course and abandon this plan by mid-year — and either return to a more traditional distribution strategy or adopt one similar the Universal agreement entered into with both AMC and Cinemark Holdings (CNK),” the note added.

347,2020-12-28T18:19:07+00:00,Here’s How Billionaire Lee Cooperman Is Preparing For Massive Inflation,"We are in the middle of a massive monetary and fiscal stimulus cycle which is already showing its effects on forex markets. In this article, we talked about billionaire Lee Cooperman's massive inflation predictions and presented his favorite investment ideas heading into 2021. Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Lee Cooperman's 5 Favorite Stocks Heading Into 2021.

Leon Cooperman, the self-made billionaire and the chairman and CEO of investment firm Omega Advisors, believes stock markets are accurately priced. The 77 years old living legend has turned his hedge fund into a family office in 2018, saying I can’t chase S&P 500 for the rest of my life. Cooperman’s hedge fund Omega Advisors have generated more than 12% annualized returns since inception through 2018.

He worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years before establishing Omega Advisors in 1991. The billionaire investor has recently expressed concerns over the rising US debt on a TV show. Meanwhile, Cooperman also expressed confidence in gold markets for the first time in his investing career. The gold price has hit new record levels in 2020, thanks to investors' move towards safe-haven assets in the wake of pandemic and concerns over the US dollar value depreciation.

""I bought gold for the first time in my life. I understand the case for gold. We're on the way to some banana republic situation. Nobody's worrying about the debt that's being created.""

The investing guru particularly focuses on the fundamentals of companies when making buying or selling decisions. His investment philosophy has also been concentrated on macro trends.

The billionaire legend has kept investments in energy companies despite historic down cycles in 2020 amid pandemic and slowing demand. Cooperman claims that oil prices will trade around $60 a barrel. Crude oil prices are currently trading around $48 a barrel, representing a substantial recovery after going negative during the second quarter of 2020.

Story continues

The legendary investor also believes in market trends. He sold old-fashioned banking giant JP Morgan's (NYSE: JPM) stake in the latest quarter, according to 13F filings. However, Leon Cooperman has expressed strong confidence in the emerging financial services technology providers like Fiserv (NASDAQ: FISV) and Mr. Cooper Group Inc (NASDAQ: COOP). The legendary investor has also been enhancing stakes in the fastest growing technology and communication sector. OMEGA ADVISORS Leon Cooperman

Portfolio diversification is also among the key factors when it comes to beating the markets, according to the billionaire Leon Cooperman.

Omega Advisors family office has diversified its portfolio towards several sectors including financial services, energy, technology, materials, healthcare, and communication services. The financial sector accounts for around 23% of the overall portfolio, while the technology and communication sectors stand around 17% and 11%, respectively. The top ten holdings represent 63.7% of the portfolio.

Leon Cooperman has made several changes in the portfolio in the latest quarter to align with the business environment. The family office fund has sold out 6 stocks and reduced stakes in 9 stocks. On the other hand, the legendary investor purchased 7 stocks and added to its 13 existing positions. At the end of the third quarter, Omega's equity portfolio market value stood around $1.017 billion.

While Leon Cooperman's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

It’s worth watching how the legendary investor has been playing with the stock market when the valuations of the majority of stocks are at record levels. We decided to review billionaire Leon Cooperman's favorite stocks heading into 2021 and in the midst of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus.

10. Athene Holding Ltd. (NYSE:ATH)

The mid-cap life and health insurance firm Athene Holding Ltd. (NYSE: ATH) is among the favorite stocks billionaire Leon Cooperman's like to hold in a portfolio heading into 2021. The firm has initiated a position in Athene Holding during the third quarter of 2020. It is the tenth-largest stock holding in Omega Advisors family office portfolio valued at $33.45 million, accounting for 3.29% of the overall portfolio.

Although Athene shares underperformed in 2020, the stock price recovered strongly in the past three months, thanks to strong organic growth. The company says they are on track to reach a record $50B of total organic and inorganic volumes in 2020.

Meanwhile, other hedge funds remained less bullish about Athene Holding's performance. The insurance company was in 31 hedge funds’ portfolio at the end of September compared to an all-time high for 50.

Lakewood Capital Management, a fund holding a long position in Athene, commented about the prospects of the insurance company in an investor letter. Here is what Lakewood Capital Management said:

“We previously discussed our long position in Athene Holding in our third quarter 2019 letter, and the stock performed well over the next several months as management continued to execute on its competitively advantaged strategy in retirement services. However, Athene’s stock was punished by the pandemic-related sell-off, and at 60% of tangible book value, we believe it has the potential to double over the next 18 months.”

9. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)

The world's largest e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the ninth-largest stock holding of the Omega Advisors family office portfolio, accounting for 3.56% of the portfolio. The investment is valued at $36.2 million. Billionaire Lee Cooperman has been holding a position in an e-commerce giant since 2016.

Shares of Amazon rallied almost 80% in the last twelve months, extending the five years gains to 480%. The pandemic-related social distancing policies along with consumer's shift towards online platforms added to share price gains and financial numbers in the past couple of quarters.

Baron Opportunity Fund, which has generated a 17.92% return in the third quarter, looks optimistic about Amazon. Here’s what Baron Opportunity Fund stated about Amazon in the shareholder's letter:

“While e-commerce penetration is rising rapidly and Amazon continues to grow its addressable market by entering new verticals, we continue to view Amazon Web Services as the more material driver of the company given its leadership in the vast and growing cloud infrastructure market and potential to compete in application software in the years to come.”

8. Ferro Corporation (NYSE:FOE)

The specialty materials producer and marketer Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) is among the billionaire Lee Cooperman's favorite stocks heading into 2021. Omega Advisors family office initiated a position in Ferro during the fourth quarter of 2019. Omega has raised its stake in the specialty materials company by 3% in the latest quarter.

Shares of Ferro Corporation recovered sharply in the last three months after experiencing a massive selloff at the beginning of 2020. Its third-quarter revenue fell 33% year over year to $241 million amid pandemic related challenges.

7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

The technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the seventh-largest stock holding of Omega Advisors family office portfolio. MSFT stake accounted for 5.08% of the overall portfolio at the end of the latest quarter. The legendary investor has been showing confidence in the technology giant since the fourth quarter of 2015.

Other hedge funds are also bullish on Microsoft. It was in 234 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of September while the all-time high for this statistics is 235. MSFT ranks #2 among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

RiverPark Advisors is also bullish on Microsoft and the firm has commented about the tech giant in the shareholder's letter. Here’s what RiverPark Advisors stated:

“The overall Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) industry is growing more than 30% per year and is forecast to reach $100 billion of revenues by 2021. We believe that cloud-based services can become the company’s largest revenue and earnings producer and expect Microsoft to generate significant and growing free cash flow ($11 billion last quarter, up 19% year-over-year). The company should deliver at least mid-to-high teens EPS growth, with upside from deploying its $134 billion cash balance ($7 billion was returned to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share buybacks). We trimmed our position on strength, and Microsoft remains a top-five position in the Fund.”

6. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ASH)

The specialty chemical provider Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH) is the long-running investment of billionaire Lee Cooperman. The firm first initiated a position in Ashland in 2014 while the Cooperman family office added to its existing position in the latest quarter. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of the Omega family office portfolio.

Ashland Global Holdings underperformed in 2020. However, the billionaire investor has bagged significant dividends from the specialty chemical company. It currently offers a dividend yield of 1.40%.

Barry Rosenstein, the activist investor and founder of Jana Partners, saw lackluster performances in the past years, forcing Barry Rosenstein to liquidate two stock hedge funds in 2019. Barry Rosenstein's investment firm held $11 billion of assets at its 2015 peak. Rosenstein has now shifted the focus exclusively on activist investing and he is currently managing just over $1.1 billion of a stock portfolio.

“We will transform into a firm solely dedicated to our core competency of shareholder engagement,” Rosenstein and his team said in an investor letter.

“This is where we have delivered our best returns for investors, developed a real competitive advantage, made our mark on numerous industries, and where we see our future and the richest opportunity set,” the letter said. Barry Rosenstein - Jana Partners

The New York-based hedge fund’s stock-picking strategies include buying stocks at a discount and unlocking value for shareholders by making big changes in business models. Jana Partners Barry Rosenstein is an activist investor and he likes to hold board positions. He is also famous for pushing Whole Foods to accept the acquisition offer from the world’s largest e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). He probably would have been a lot richer if he had taken the cash from Amazon for his Whole Foods stake and purchased Amazon shares with that windfall. At the time Amazon shares were trading below $1000.

He was a key player in breaking Graw-Hill into two and also persuaded energy company El Paso to break the business into two separate companies. Jana Partners have also advised Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to cut costs.

Barry Rosenstein's investment firm likes to hold positions in companies for the long-term instead of making short bets. Its average time held in the top ten positions stands around 6.50 quarters.

Story continues

Jana Strategic Investment fund generated an impressive 52% gain in 2019. Last year's gains helped Jana to rank as the best activist investor because shareholders believe Jana’s push for making operational or other changes helped companies to generate big returns for investors.

The firm seeks to buy stocks when trading at a steep discount and then works with the management to generate value for shareholders.

The latest 13F filing shows that the New York-based hedge fund has made big changes in its portfolio. Barry Rosenstein investment firm bought 3 new stocks and added to two existing positions. The fund also sold out two positions and reduced its stake in three stocks.

While Barry Rosenstein’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here).

Let’s now begin our countdown on Barry Rosenstein's top 10 stock picks.

10. Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF)

The jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co (NYSE: TIF) is the tenth-largest stock holding of Jana Partners stock portfolio. The hedge fund currently holds a call position in Tiffany valued at $4.2 million, accounting for 0.38% of the overall portfolio.

The New York-based hedge fund first initiated a position in Tiffany in 2017.

Despite sluggish share price performance in 2020 due to pandemic, shares of jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co rallied almost 70% in the past five years. The company has also been rewarding investors with big dividends. It has raised dividends every year in the past 18 years. Tiffany has generated $1.01 billion in the September quarter revenue while earnings per share came in at $1.11.

Mark Erceg, Tiffany Chief Financial Officer stated, “We believe that expanding operating margins by nearly 500 basis points in the third quarter as compared to the prior year and posting exceptionally strong net earnings growth against an extremely difficult macroeconomic backdrop demonstrates the strength and durability of the Tiffany brand.”

Rosenstein obviously bought the TIF call options to protect himself against a decline in price in case LVMH doesn't take over TIF at the premium it promised. LVMH initially offered $135 per share to TIF shareholders, however, after the pandemic broke out it renegotiated a lower price of $131.50. We believe there are better places than TIF to invest your money right now.

9. The Brink's Company (NYSE: BCO)

Barry Rosenstein's investment firm has initiated a big position in The Brink's Company (NYSE: BCO) during the third quarter. In the case of Brink's Company, the hedge fund has used its strategy of buying stocks at discount. Shares of the security company remained under pressure during the second and third quarter amid pandemic related challenges.

However, the stock price rebounded sharply in the past two months, thanks to the broader stock market rally on coronavirus vaccine hopes and US elections.

The company’s cost-cutting along with margin enhancement strategies helped in enhancing investors’ confidence. It has generated 5% year over year revenue growth in the latest quarter, with an expectation for exceeding the high end of full-year revenue guidance for $3.7 billion.

8. New Relic, Inc (NYSE:NEWR)

The software company New Relic, Inc (NYSE: NEWR) is among the newcomers to Barry Rosenstein's investment firm Jana Partners stock portfolio.

The hedge fund initiated a position in New Relic during the third quarter by purchasing 546,309 shares valued at $30.7 million. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Jana Partners portfolio, accounting for 2.72% of the overall portfolio.

New Relic shares fell sharply after trading above the $100 level last year. Barry Rosenstein saw the share price underperformance as a buying opportunity.

The software company has generated 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the September quarter while its loss per share came in at $0.07 compared to the consensus for a $0.01 gain.

7. HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HDS)

Industrial distributor HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: HDS) is one of the long-running stock holdings of Jana Partners.

Despite selling 16% of shares in the third quarter, industrial distributors accounted for 4.16% of the overall portfolio. Shares of HD Supply Holdings rallied 40% this year, extending the five years gains to 85%. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) recently stroke a deal to acquire HD Supply Holdings for $56 per share in cash.

6. Callaway Golf Company (NYSE:ELY)

Jana Partners sold almost half of its stake in Callaway Golf Company (NYSE: ELY) in the latest quarter. Despite that, Golf Company is the sixth-largest stock holding of Barry Rosenstein's stock portfolio, accounting for 4.98% of the overall portfolio. The hedge fund first initiated a stake in Callaway Golf Company in 2019.

Shares of Golf Company soared 14% this year, accelerating the five-year gains to 146%. Its share price gains are backed by robust financial growth.

The company has generated 11% year over year revenue growth in the latest quarter while earnings per share of $0.54 grew 69% from the year-ago period. Moreover, the company expects the extension of the revenue growth trend in the quarters ahead despite pandemic related challenges.

Golf Company CEO said, ""Although we expect some level of continued volatility due to the ongoing pandemic, Q3's trends have thus far continued into Q4 and, perhaps more importantly, we also now appreciate even more that all of our businesses are likely to be favored in both the realities of the current world and likely consumer trends post-pandemic. All of our business segments, as well as the Topgolf business, support an outdoor, active, and healthy way of life that is compatible with a world of social distancing. These are key factors that will likely be important for consumers over the next several months and will also likely continue post-pandemic.""

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: Well, my family Christmas tradition tends to consist of getting Chinese food and going to the movies. But obviously, things are a little bit different this year. We will not be going out to a theater, but we will have to choose what to watch on a streaming service. We're joined now by Gitesh Pandya. He is the Box Office Guru founder and editor. Gitesh, thank you for being here.

And obviously, things have changed in terms of how companies are coming out with their movies now, how studios are coming out. And I think the biggest marker of this change might be ""Wonder Woman"" being out on HBO Max streaming simultaneously with what is going on in the theaters. The people you're talking to in the industry-- I mean, how big of a change is this? How long-lasting of a change do they think it will be?

GITESH PANDYA: Well, it's a bit of a panic that's been going across the industry, as far as will this be a game-changer? Will other studios follow? I think it's very experimental. I think it's a bold move that Warner Brothers made. Now, obviously, movie theaters have been closed for a long time this year. Normally, the box office would be in the $10-$11 billion range. A year ago, it was $11.4 billion in 2019. This year, for 2020, we're one week away from finishing, I'm projecting $2.3 billion for 2020. That's an 80% plunge. That's 80% of the box office wiped out this year because theaters are closed.

And it's not going to change too much in the first quarter of next year. So much of 2021, a lot of theaters closed, slowly reopening. Warner Brothers hedging their bets and saying, listen, we're going to open these movies in theaters where they are allowed, but also on HBO Max in the United States over a 30-day window to drive subscribers. And ""Wonder Woman 1984"" is the first movie to try this sort of new strategy. It's this weekend. I've had a chance to see it. It is a movie you want to see on the big screen. It's a superhero film, but obviously, about a third or so of the theaters across the US are not even open. So you'll see an audience of comic book fans seeing this at home on HBO Max this weekend.

Story continues

But it does open the door for this whole holiday season for people to see movies like this at home on streaming. And then, the other studios so far have not been following suit, but we'll have to wait and see.

BRIAN SOZZI: Gitesh, let's stay on the movie theaters. What does the movie theater industry look like after the pandemic?

GITESH PANDYA: It's incredibly challenging. And in my opinion, I think it's about the experience. That's where the theaters have to really push it. They need to offer a bigger and better experience in the theater that you cannot get at home because if one thing that we've seen in 2020, it's that the amount of streaming content has skyrocketed-- not just B-list product, but A-list product. Almost everything is coming at home because of necessity.

So that's a new challenge at theaters have next year. So when it comes to the seats, the food, the concessions, the drinks, live entertainment or live talent doing interactive Q&As, things like that-- anything that theaters can do to up the experience, to make it unique, exciting is going to help.

Also, the premium formats-- IMAX, 4DX-- that's something you can't get at home. So I do think that 2021 is going to be led by the bigger brands, the big action films, the movies that really take advantage of the big screen experience. And over the next two years or so, we'll start seeing some of the smaller films get back as well. But it's going to be the experience, and these theaters have to up their game to get the bodies back into those seats.

JULIE HYMAN: Gitesh, for the movies that are being released streaming-- either streaming only or simultaneously in the theaters-- how do we measure those? Because traditionally you would get box office receipts from the theater companies. You could also do some on-the-ground research. Now, do we just have to rely on the studios or the streaming companies to give us the numbers?

GITESH PANDYA: Well, right. For streaming, it's a new methodology. Is called crossing your fingers. You have to hope that these companies release numbers. Usually, they'll release them on an earnings call at some point where it benefits them-- not on any regular basis. And so for some of these films, there are a lot of streams, a lot of views that are happening, and they will boost them, more from a PR perspective. And as far as the media goes, as far as consumers, we don't know exactly how much of a success each film is. The studios know themselves. They'll share what little they can.

But I think in the broader sense, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix, Amazon, and so on-- they are looking to drive subscribers. And you can do that by having more content, more unique exclusive content, and that's why you're seeing some of these studios who are affiliated with a streaming service push some of their titles to streaming only instead of a theatrical release.

For example, Disney-- they own Pixar. They have the movie ""Soul,"" which was supposed to come out last June in theaters. It got pushed, and now it's coming out on streaming tomorrow. It's a wonderful film. I recommend it. But it's not one of those sort of ""Toy Story"" franchise films which gets pushed until theaters are ready. It's going straight to streaming, and it helps to make Disney Plus a nice value for consumers.

And that's part of the point-- have the content roll in along with TV shows and other sort of items to drive those subscribers. And HBO Max's deal is one of them. But it's a crowded field, and you're going to see a lot of growth in all of these streaming services trying to live side by side with a rebuilding of the theatrical box office in 2021.

BRIAN SOZZI: All right, Gitesh, and Disney has a ton of content coming out next year. As you analyze their slate of content set to come to market, what grade would you put on it?

GITESH PANDYA: Oh, I'd say-- I'd give it an A, A minus. I think they have some terrific titles. 2019 was a banner year for Disney. I don't think we're going to see that again anytime soon. They had ""Avengers Endgame,"" ""Lion King,"" and so on. So for 2021, they still do have major films from the Marvel universe. Obviously, 2020 was the first time in a long time-- 12 years-- where no Marvel films came out. So those fans are hungry and waiting for ""Black Widow"" and more films to come out in 2021.

But you also have Pixar, and you also have the main Disney animation studio coming out with films. They do have ""Raya and the Last Dragon,"" which is a new original film coming out in March. This one will have the same format as ""Mulan,"" meaning it will have a Disney premiere access for $30 option for people who want that. The difference is ""Mulan"" did not play in US theaters. ""Raya"" will open in US theaters. They're hoping that a certain number of theaters will be open and ready to go for those who choose to see it that way. So it'll be a little bit of a hybrid model.

But they have a lot of content in all four quarters, and a lot of the industry will be looking to Disney to sort of lead the way in this charge to come back.

JULIE HYMAN: Gitesh, really quickly-- of the movies that are coming out on Christmas, what's your top recommendation?

GITESH PANDYA: Oh, well, you know, I would say Pixar's ""Soul"" is probably the top one. It's one of those meaning of life kind of films, good for all ages, makes you think. And I plan to see it again. It's a good one.

JULIE HYMAN: That's definitely news I can use in my household. Thank you so much, Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru.

355,2020-12-23T12:00:19+00:00,All You Want for Christmas Is a Home Movie Theater,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The dark textured walls are lined with dimly lit sconces and surround-sound speakers. Below them, carpeted tiers of cup-holding reclining seats jut toward a large projection screen. The room doesn’t yet smell of buttery popcorn, but it begs for it — this is a movie theater, after all. Except this theater doesn’t require tickets or face coverings. It isn’t even attached to a mall or parking lot. It’s just a room in the basement of a home that recently sold in Paramus, New Jersey.

The scene isn’t an unusual one for Bergen County, one part of the state that’s experienced a boom in home sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic as city dwellers seep into suburbs in search of more space. The area is teeming with realtors’ signs and McMansions racing to finish construction before the buying frenzy is over. In November, the rate of U.S. housing starts for single-family homes rose for a seventh month to the highest since 2007. Demand for million-dollar listings has been growing the fastest, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And in towns like Paramus, those tend to come with a few requisites tailored to post-Covid life: plenty of office space, a gym — and a movie theater with all the fixings.

“In new constructions it’s now almost standard,” said Taylor Lucyk, a broker associate for Christie’s International Real Estate in northern New Jersey. He started noticing more home theaters in 2019, but at the time they were more of a bonus feature. “Now with Covid, it’s just kind of become the norm.”

As Wall Street investors try to gauge whether multiplex cinema operators will survive the crisis, it’s hard to look at this trend and feel very optimistic about movie chains’ prospects. That’s not to say that mini home theaters — a swanky excess of million-dollar houses — are becoming commonplace. But middle-class households are increasingly investing in electronics that try to recreate the theater experience as well. The declining cost of large, high-resolution television sets and sound bars has made that possible.

Story continues

A quick online search on Amazon and Best Buy shows 65-inch 4K flat-panel smart TVs for as low as $400 (though the ultra-vivid OLEDs are still much more expensive). Between 2014 and 2019, the average cost-per-square-inch of screen in the U.S. fell to 39 cents from $2.15, an 82% drop, according to a Deloitte report this month that predicts a rise in sales of next-generation 8K TVs is coming next.

Cinema-quality streaming programs — such as the onslaught of Star Wars and Marvel series hitting Disney+ in the coming years — will make 4K and 8K TVs that much more desirable. AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros. studio is even releasing all of next year’s films, including big-budget productions such as “Dune” and “The Matrix 4,” on HBO Max the same day that they arrive in theaters. In the meantime, Covid-19 has made all things home entertainment — streaming-TV apps, video games, comfortable viewing setups — almost indispensable.

TV sales are at a record in the U.S. this year, according to Stephen Baker, vice president at research firm NPD Group Inc. and adviser to the technology and mobile industries. He sees the final tally coming in at $17 billion to $18 billion, up from $14.7 billion in 2019. Nearly 10 million more units will have sold this year than in any other time during the last decade. He said a large part of the growth is coming from really big TVs — 65 inches and larger. That’s quite a shift from predictions that tablets and phones would become the viewing device of choice in the streaming era. “We all got maybe a little bit seduced by the start of mobile streaming, and what we’ve see in the past couple of years is this return to the home-entertainment stack,” he said. “Everybody wants the biggest, best TV they can afford.”

As for projectors, Epson America, a unit of Japan’s Seiko Epson Corp., has had double-digit sales growth “across the board” for its home theater projector models ranging in price from $500 to more than $5,000, said Mike Isgrig, vice president of North America consumer sales and marketing for the electronics company. And shoppers aren’t just buying projectors for indoor use — a summer spent at home drove interest in backyard movie nights as well.

None of this is likely to be a 2020 phenomenon. And so the double blow of the pandemic and the streaming wars could mean that movie theaters — the kind where you sit next to strangers — never fully rebound. In the latest weekly Morning Consult poll, 39% of U.S. adults said it would be more than six months before they’d feel comfortable going to the movies; another 23% didn’t know or didn’t have an opinion. It’s not a good sign that the majority are either still wary of theaters or just don't care to go anymore.

The coronavirus wasn’t the cause of this shift, but it was a potent accelerant. And it could be argued that the biggest change this year wasn’t even in consumer behavior — that began long before Covid-19. Instead, it was the entertainment giants that stopped resisting the Netflixication of Hollywood. After both Warner Bros. made its Dec. 3 announcement regarding next year’s films and Walt Disney Co. held its streaming-strategy reveal on Dec. 10, there was a central theme in the reader comments that subsequently flowed in: It was time to buy that 65-inch TV. Here’s one such response made public on LinkedIn:

Christopher Nolan, who wrote and directed Warner Bros.’ “Tenet,” reportedly told a cinema industry trade show in June that the sci-fi spy thriller “is a film whose image and sound really needs to be enjoyed in your theaters on the big screen.” But why? Technology has made it possible to get much the same experience without leaving home. When “Wonder Woman 1984,” another Warner Bros. movie, gets released to both theaters and HBO Max on Christmas day, the streaming uptake and reviews will only give the industry more confidence that it is moving in the right direction. As for consumers who already invested in a big-screen TV, a popcorn machine may be next.

What Happened: Formula One is the world's most valuable motorsports series. F1's outgoing chief executive officer, Chase Carey, told Financial Times that he has held ""substantive discussions with Amazon and all the global digital platforms"" for new screening deals.

Carey said that online streaming platforms are important potential partners and serve as an opportunity for F1 to expand its business.

Reportedly, F1 wants to expand its audience and target younger fans who switch to watching sport online rather than traditional TV networks.

Why It Matters: F1 is under pressure to find new revenue streams after the pandemic led to operating losses of $363 million in the first nine months of 2020, FT reports. Liberty Media was forced to furlough half its workforce and injected $1.4 billion cash in April to weather the pandemic.

FT reports that Amazon did not comment on the story, but it has been one of the most aggressive platforms in bidding for live sports rights worldwide.

Amazon has secured rights to stream National Football League matches in the US and the English Premier League in the United Kingdom. The Jeff Bezos-led internet giant is also looking to expand in the hot cricket streaming market in India. Facebook, Inc (NASDAQ: FB) has also joined the content-streaming bandwagon in India.

FT notes that Amazon and other streaming platforms have been reluctant to offer the huge rights money that broadcasters have previously paid for F1. The biggest broadcasting deal for F1 is with Sky in the U.K., grossing $250 million a year until 2024.

Price Action: AMZN shares closed marginally up by 0.1% at $3,206.52 on Tuesday.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Finance Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Leon Cooperman.

Leon Cooperman, the Chairman and CEO of investment advisory firm Omega Advisors, is a titan of the hedge fund industry. The billionaire money manager rose from humble beginnings in the Bronx to become the leader of Goldman Sachs’ asset management division.

Cooperman retired in 1991 after 25 years with the company to launch his own hedge fund, the main fund of which generated annualized returns of 12.4% from inception through mid-2018, beating the S&P 500 by an average of about 2.9 percentage points annually during that period. Tired of chasing said S&P, Cooperman converted the fund into a family office at the end of 2018.

The 77-year-old Cooperman remains a prominent and respected figure in the finance world, being consulted regularly on CNBC and other media outlets and hasn’t shied away from making bold predictions in the coronavirus era. Best Finance Stocks To Buy Now Leon Cooperman Omega Advisors

Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors

In a May interview on The Reopening podcast, Cooperman stated that capitalism was likely to be changed forever given the widespread government intervention in the economy during the pandemic, saying that if the government will protect us from that kind of downside risk, then it likewise has the right to regulate the upside. In that same vein, he suggested taxes will continue to climb higher as America shifts further to the left, especially if Biden won the presidency, which was eventually the case.

Cooperman further suggested that the stock market is now more expensive than credit, and stated later in a separate interview on CNBC that the market’s rapid growth from its pandemic lows has likely come at the expense of future gains, predicting that returns are likely to be “relatively unimpressive for a long time”.

Not all richly valued stocks are created equal however, as Cooperman noted during a September RealVision interview that tech giants Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), were not expensive given interest rates.

Story continues

Cooperman held all four of those stocks in his highly concentrated 13F portfolio as of September 30, though it was finance sector stocks that had the heaviest weighting in that portfolio at about 31%. We’ll take a look at the billionaire investing legend’s ten favorite finance stocks below.

Hedge funds’ reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. That doesn’t mean there isn’t money to be made off their consensus stock picks. Our research has shown that hedge funds’ small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 66 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Now then, let’s check out the 10 Best Finance Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Leon Cooperman. Note that all hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 800+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey as part of our market-beating investment strategy.

10. Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:AC)

We begin with Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:AC), which Leon Cooperman owned 8,600 shares of at the end of Q3, selling off 43 of them during the quarter. It’s the first of two stocks on this list with direct hedge fund ties, as Associated Capital was spun off from Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO in 2015.

AC is somewhat of an interesting pick of Cooperman’s given that it aims to use its capital in pursuit of private equity and late stage venture capital. Cooperman took a shot at the former last year, calling private equity a “scam” during an investment event in September and warning that the industry’s returns would evaporate as interest rates rose (which of course hasn’t happened).

Associated Capital managed $1.25 billion in assets at the end of Q3, down from $1.65 billion a year earlier. The investment manager’s Q3 revenue likewise declined to $1.95 million, down from $2.75 million in 2019, though its diluted net income per share held steady at $0.26.

9. Falcon Minerals Corporation (NASDAQ:FLMN)

FLMN ranks 9th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. Leon Cooperman has owned a stake in Falcon Minerals Corporation (NASDAQ:FLMN) since the middle of 2019 and boosted that position by 245,648 shares in Q3. 20 hedge funds were long FLMN on September 30.

Cooperman revealed on CNBC in March that he was bullish on energy-related companies, expecting oil prices to rebound. Falcon Minerals is generally considered an energy company given its assets are all oil and gas related, but it’s also akin to a finance company given that it’s not involved in the production side of its assets (and thus has no capex requirements) and that its core strategy is to return the vast majority of its high-margin cash flow to investors through dividends.

Falcon Minerals owns 256,000 gross unit acres with over 3,000 potential drilling locations in the Eagle Ford Shale, as well as royalty assets covering 68,000 gross unit acres in the Marcellus Shale. Falcon generated pro forma free cash flow of $0.07 per share during Q3 and raised its quarterly dividend by 117% to $0.065 per share, returning 93% of that cash flow to investors.

8. First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCRD)

FCRD ranks 8th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. Cooperman made a large investment in First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCRD) during Q3, buying 2.68 million shares to build a 9.5% ownership stake in the business development company, which is a separate, publicly traded division of First Eagle Investment Management.

FCRD has a portfolio of assets primarily comprised of 1st lien senior secured debt in middle market companies across a wide range of industries. The company earned $3.2 million in net investment income during Q3, down from $6.9 million a year earlier, declines which were attributed to portfolio contraction and an increase in non-accrual (unpaid) status loans.

The BDC was forced to slash its quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.10 earlier this year, though as the stock has cratered by 43% in 2020, shares still yield a hefty 11.08%.

7. MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC)

MVC ranks 7th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC) represents one of the oldest holdings in Leon Cooperman’s portfolio, dating back to early 2015. He owned 1.70 million shares of the business development company on September 30, unchanged throughout the third quarter.

In August, MVC Capital entered into a merger agreement with Barings BDC in a deal valued at approximately $177.5 million in cash and stock for MVC shareholders. Cooperman expressed his satisfaction with the deal and entered into a voting agreement that will see him vote his shares in favor of the transaction.

“We are pleased with the result and thank the board of MVC Capital for its hard work and success in delivering an excellent outcome for shareholders. We believe this transaction represents strong shareholder alignment and provides the best path forward,” Cooperman said.

The combined company will have more than $1.2 billion of pro forma investments and is estimated to earn net investment income of as much as $0.20 per share in the first full quarter following the deal’s completion, which was expected to occur during the current quarter.

6. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) rounds out the first half of the list of Leon Cooperman’s top finance stock picks, with the billionaire maintaining his 370,000-share position in the company, which ranks as one of the 10 Best Bank Stocks To Buy Right Now.

Cooperman reopened a stake in Citigroup in late 2017 after selling off his previous position in the stock during 2016. At the time (late 2017) he expressed confidence in the financial sector as a whole given his expectation that interest rates would keep rising and boost banks’ profit margins. That was indeed the case throughout 2018 and Citi did indeed boost its earnings during that year, hitting a 10-year high with diluted earnings per share of $6.68, which it improved upon further last year.

Interest rates began falling again in late 2019 however and then plummeted to 0.25% in the wake of the pandemic, and Citigroup’s bottom line has understandably suffered again as a result. Cooperman has nonetheless maintained his position in Citi throughout 2020. The stock currently trades at a significant discount to its book value, offers a nice dividend yield of 3.44%, and could be poised for a nice run coming out of the pandemic.

360,2020-12-22T10:49:47+00:00,Markets are moving away from a 'Darwinistic' phase: Morning Brief,"Tuesday, December 22, 2020

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe

Survival of the fittest should be a fading theme in 2021.

Here in the Morning Brief and on Yahoo Finance we’ve written a lot about various markets forecasts for 2021.

The Wall Street consensus says earnings should grow appreciably next year and stocks should continue to rise. The details might differ from firm to firm, but the broad outlines are nine-tenths the same.

And while Rich Bernstein, CEO and CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors, isn’t exactly zigging while the rest of the Street is zagging, we found his outlook offered a unique and helpful thematic frame on what the year and economic cycle ahead could have in store.

As Rich puts it to his clients: “Embrace the profits cycle.”

And the profits cycle tells you that as regimes change, what had been working tends to stop working while areas of the market that hadn’t been working should start finding a bid. Everything old is eventually new again. With the economy entering a phase where the profit cycle is rising, sectors of the market that had fallen out of favor should become more attractive as the economy and profits accelerate out of the pandemic. (Source: Richard Bernstein Advisors)

“The direction of the overall stock market in 2021 could be very misleading and could mask a significant shift in underlying market leadership,” Bernstein writes. “In other words, the stock market might do well or not, but the potential for a major shift in market leadership could present significant investment opportunities.”

Because while the pandemic and resulting economic fallout brought financial markets and the global economy to its knees, let us not forget the dynamics that were driving markets at the end of the last decade. Narrowing leadership amid a slowing profit cycle — which means market gains were driven by rising valuations not rising profits — helped fuel the first group of companies to attain market capitalizations north of $1 trillion.

The FAAMG stocks became the hot trade at the end of the last decade not because the acronym was catchy but because Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) were the companies with the strongest earnings growth.

Story continues

“When profits cycles decelerate, markets become ‘Darwinistic’ and survival of the fittest determines stock performance,” Bernstein writes. “Fewer and fewer companies can maintain their earnings growth as overall economic conditions worsen and investors gravitate toward a smaller universe of growing companies and bid up those companies’ valuations. Simply put, the price of earnings growth appreciates as growth itself becomes increasingly scarce.”

But with the economy coming out of recession, a new cycle of economic and profit growth begins. For Bernstein, this mean the trades that had fallen out of favor with investors should benefit next year while the sectors that had been most loved could take a step back.

And so in this case, big cap tech stocks could be shunned by investors like financials (XLF) and materials (XLB) enjoy the early stages of an economic upturn.

“The biggest story for 2021 might not be ‘the market,’ but rather a significant shift in market leadership and sector, style, and size performance that is currently unimaginable to many investors,” Bernstein writes.

“Innovation, disruption, intangible assets, and long time-horizon investing could give way to ugly cyclicals, unknown small caps, downtrodden value, real assets, and investors’ demand for immediate strong earnings growth.”

361,2020-12-21T07:00:58+00:00,"Amazon Can Ask Regulators to Block Deal With India’s Future Group, Court Says","(Bloomberg) -- An Indian court allowed Amazon.com Inc.. to oppose Future Group’s $3.4 billion asset sale to Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate but left it to local regulators to decide on the deal, in a mixed ruling for the U.S. giant fighting Asia’s richest man for dominance in one of the world’s largest retail markets.

The Delhi High Court said Monday it can’t bar the e-commerce giant from writing to regulators objecting to the indebted Indian retailer’s plan to sell its assets to Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. The ruling by a single-judge bench can be challenged before a higher court. The court’s position neither bars nor allows the Future-Reliance transaction.

The legal spat has drawn the battle lines between two of the world’s richest men, Jeff Bezos and Ambani, as they fight to control India’s estimated $1 trillion retail market. Reliance is already the country’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer. Acquiring Future’s assets would give it unparalleled edge over rivals -- an advantage Amazon is not willing to cede. For the distressed Future Group, the asset sale is a crucial bailout deal.​

While Amazon has been allowed to petition Indian regulators against this transaction, recent experience shows it may not always be fruitful. Despite writing to the local antitrust regulator asking it not to approve the takeover by Reliance until arbitration proceedings are complete, the agency approved the transaction on Nov 20.

The American company also suffered a setback with the court saying that its investment into the Future Group required government approval and not securing it violated India’s foreign exchange and investment laws.

Future Retail Ltd.’s shares jumped as much as 5% on Monday in Mumbai while Reliance gained 1.5%.

​Future approached the court last month after Amazon got a Singapore arbitration panel to temporarily halt the transaction on Oct. 25. The U.S. firm, which owns a minority stake in one of Future’s unlisted firms, accused the local retailer of breaching a contract by agreeing to a buyout by an Indian rival.

Story continues

The Indian court said Monday that the emergency arbitration on Amazon’s plea was valid but stopped short of commenting on the legal validity of the arbitration verdict.

Reliance said on Oct. 26 that it intends to purchase Future Retail’s assets “without any delay,” notwithstanding the arbitration court order. Future Group, controlled by tycoon Kishore Biyani, had said the matter “will have to be tested” under Indian laws.

Harish Salve, the lawyer representing listed flagship Future Retail Ltd., urged the court on Nov. 10 to bar Amazon from writing letters to local antitrust and market regulators in its continued efforts to block the deal with Reliance. Amazon’s counsel argued that Future’s petition was not legally tenable.

The Future group is critically dependent on the asset sale going through. It defaulted on obligations earlier this year. Future Retail has posted losses for three straight quarters and reported a 74% revenue drop in the latest quarter.

The Indian retailer will run into serious financial trouble if the asset sale fails, its lawyer Salve told the court on Nov. 10, arguing that the emergency arbitration ruling was not binding in India. Amazon wants to “sink the ship” by not letting Reliance acquire Future’ assets, he said.

364,2020-12-18T21:31:39+00:00,"Sony, Microsoft Offer Cyberpunk Refunds After Player Complaints","(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have taken unusual measures to appease customers unhappy with CD Projekt SA’s Cyberpunk 2077 game, which was released earlier this month and is riddled with bugs, especially in console versions.

For PlayStation players, Sony is offering full refunds for Cyberpunk 2077 and is removing the title, one of the year’s most highly anticipated gaming blockbusters, from the PlayStation Store. Microsoft is also offering refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, “to ensure that every player is able to get the experience they expect on Xbox.”

Sony’s radical move to pull the game “until further notice” came after the console version of Cyberpunk 2077 debuted Dec. 10, following several delays, to reviews calling out problems and an online outcry from players frustrated with its poor performance.

CD Projekt shares shed 12% in Warsaw Friday, erasing most of this year’s gains.

Warsaw-based developer CD Projekt -- best known for 2015’s The Witcher 3, part of a franchise that was turned into a successful Netflix Inc. series -- has offered refunds to any disappointed players, but Sony is going a step further by entirely removing the game from its store. Cyberpunk features Hollywood star Keanu Reeves as an in-game character and has used the actor as its most visible ambassador in the buildup to its release.

CD Projekt, whose shares have plunged 40% since Dec. 4, confirmed Sony’s decision in a regulatory statement. The studio said it was “working hard” to bring its game back to the PlayStation store and that it had discussions with Sony regarding a full refund for all gamers seeking one.

It said that “all copies, whether digital or physical, will continue to receive support and updates” to help fix the game’s teething problems.

Trigon analyst Kacper Kopron said Sony’s decision is one of “worst scenarios” for the company as PlayStation represents two-thirds of the console market. He expects the move may trim estimates for Cyberpunk console sales by 30% to 40%.

Story continues

Erste Group analyst Emil Poplawski cut his recommendation on CD Projekt’s shares to reduce from buy, setting a target price of 280.5 zloty. Analysts at MBank and VTB Capital expect the game to be restored to PlayStation’s store after larger fixes in early 2021.

On Monday, the developers posted a message on Twitter saying they “should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.” But the company had not cleared its offer of a refund with console manufacturers Sony or Microsoft Corp., both of which have stringent refund policies.

This week, many players who requested refunds found themselves out of luck. Sony said it was working to resolve issues with accessing the refund. Microsoft said it has granted refunds to the vast majority of customers who have requested one.

CD Projekt Chief Executive Officer Adam Kicinski was cited as saying by PAP news agency that the gaming studio isn’t currently holding talks with Microsoft about removing Cyberpunk from its Xbox store.

It’s rare for any title to be removed from stores so soon after release. Previous examples include Square Enix Holdings Co.’s Final Fantasy XIV, which was taken offline for an overhaul following its disastrous 2010 launch, and Amazon.com Inc.’s Crucible, yanked from PC stores earlier this year and subsequently canceled.

Cyberpunk’s developers faced intense public pressure to get the game out this year, rising to the level of death threats, as Senior Game Designer Andrzej Zawadzki tweeted in October. Six-day work weeks became the norm in the final months leading up to the eventual release, breaking with previous pledges from CD Projekt leaders that the company would avoid imposing a so-called crunch to hurry a game into existence through overtime.

The company has said it’s continuing work to rectify the issues players are encountering in Cyberpunk 2077 -- and its prior blockbuster, The Witcher 3, improved drastically after its release thanks to downloadable patches.

Some obvious names that trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq come to mind. Many of them depend on America for much of their livelihood. It’s why the latest U.S. election cycle has been mesmerizing television for Canadian business executives.

In November, CEOs across Canada and those operating from within the U.S. were definitely sweating the details. After all, when the U.S. sneezes, Canada catches a cold.

As professor Richard Leblanc notes, “There really isn’t an industry that’s immune from what happens south of the border. What goes on, goes right to the top very quickly.” Leblanc teaches governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto.

Well, Joe Biden won and Donald Trump lost. Canada will now get ready to see how the relationship shifts — and it always does after a change in presidents.

7 Growth Stocks You Don't Want to Sleep On

So, for this article, I’m recommending seven Canadian stocks that generate a significant amount of their revenue in the United States. As the headline reads, each one could be considered the feather in America’s hat.

Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) BRP (NASDAQ:DOOO) Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Toront0-Dominion (NYSE:TD) Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) FirstService (NASDAQ:FSV)

Canadian Stocks to Buy: Lululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.

I remember when I first recommended this apparel brand back in August of 2016. I called LULU stock a top 50 S&P 500 investment over the next decade. The only problem was it wasn’t part of the index — and still isn’t.

At the time, Lululemon’s sales in the U.S. accounted for over 60% of its fiscal 2015 revenue of $$2.1 billion (Page 61). In the company’s fiscal year 2019, U.S. sales accounted for over 71% of its $4 billion in annual revenue.

Story continues

Despite an increase in the percentage of sales generated in the U.S. over these four fiscal years, the company also did an excellent job of growing sales in its home market of Canada and overseas.

As big a deal as this pick of the Canadian stocks was four years ago, it’s an even bigger deal today.

On Dec. 10, it reported Q3 2020 sales that grew 22% year-over-year (YOY), despite a serious downturn in walk-in traffic due to Covid-19. CNBC reports that Neil Saunders, the Retail Managing Director at GlobalData, said, “While a V-shaped recovery may not be materializing for most of apparel retail, Lululemon has bounced back from the weak start to its year with a stunning set of third-quarter numbers […] Our data also show that Lululemon has picked up plenty of new shoppers, especially in womenswear.”

So, when it comes to retail, Lululemon is one of the best stocks to own — and it just happens to be run out of Vancouver.

Given the returns of tech stocks in 2020, Shopify’s performance — a year-to-date (YTD) total return of 195% through Dec. 18 — seems almost pedestrian.

The reality is, though, that SHOP stock is having a good year and (barring some major change in consumer shopping habits) the company’s e-commerce platform will remain in demand for companies of all sizes.

As InvestorPlace’s Faisal Humayun stated recently, Shopify is crushing it.

“From a financial perspective, the company reported cash and equivalents of $6.1 billion [as of the end of September],” Humayun wrote on Dec. 14. He added, “In addition, with improving operating leverage, I expect operating cash flows increase in the coming years. This will allow the company to continue aggressive investments in growth and research and development.”

The last time I covered SHOP on a single-stock basis was in April, when it traded around $525. At the time, I wondered if the stock would be heading to $650 or back to $350, where it traded during the March correction.

I concluded that if you were holding Shopify stock for the long haul — say 2-3 years — buying in the $500s wasn’t a bad call. Now, it has doubled from April prices to over $1,170 per share.

The 7 Worst Performing Stocks of 2020

Heading into 2021, I don’t know if SHOP will double again. However, solid returns definitely appear to be in the cards for this one of the Canadian stocks, given its business model’s undeniable strength.

BRP (DOOO) close-up of blue-green ski doo with BRP (DOOO) logo on front

BRP stands for Bombardier Recreational Products, but you probably better know its brands — Ski-Doo, Lynx, Sea-Doo, Can-Am, Alumacraft boats and more. While the company’s heritage is in snowmobiles, it has also grown to become a big seller of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and side-by-side vehicles (SSVs).

In the third quarter ended Oct. 31, BRP had sales of over 1.67 billion CAD (over $1.31 billion), 1.9% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. However, on the bottom line, it had operating profits of 284.3 million CAD (about $223 million), nearly 37% higher YOY.

As a result of a more profitable sales mix in fiscal 2021, the company is expected to grow its normalized earnings per share (EPS) by about 37% this year, despite an overall 1.4% decline in sales. Consumers are paying top dollar for its year-round products (ATVs, SSVs) and that’s showing up on the income statement.

In November 2018, I recommended investors buy Polaris (NYSE:PII), BRP’s biggest rival. Right now, it’s up marginally over the two-year period. At the same time, DOOO stock is up 177% over the same period.

As it continues to gain global market share, I expect BRP to keep delivering strong double-digit returns for shareholders in 2021, earning its place on this list of the best Canadian stocks.

Enbridge (ENB) close up of oil pipelines at sunset

In 2019, Enbridge generated 30.1 billion CAD ($23.6 billion) in the United States, accounting for roughly 60% of its overall revenues (Page 120). In the past two fiscal years, ENB’s sales in Canada have grown by 10.4%. South of the border, however, they grew by a more robust 14.4% over the same period. While that might not seem like a big difference, when you’re talking about over 50 billion CAD in annual revenue, it’s noticeable.

Now, most of the Canadian stocks on this list are growth-oriented stocks. But Enbridge — whose energy infrastructure helps keep North America running — is a combination of value, growth and income.

On Dec. 8, the company declared a 3% increase in its quarterly dividend to 83.5 cents CAD. The annualized dividend rate of 3.34 CAD yields a very healthy 7.8%. Plus, with 3.95 billion CAD ($3.1 billion) in free cash flow over the past 12 months and growing at a healthy clip, ENB stock has plenty of cash to make the annual payments.

Its total return YTD is -16%. As long as the oil and gas industry continues to sputter, Enbridge might experience the same result in 2021. However, with the company expected to begin construction on the Line 3 pipeline project in Minnesota in the year ahead, Enbridge’s growth plans are starting to look up.

So, get paid by waiting on Enbridge to inevitably grow its business south of the border.

It’s not been a good year for most Canadian banks, although Toronto-Dominion’s most recent quarterly results suggest the pandemic’s wrath may be coming to an end. Recently, TD stock has come on in recent months, gaining over 18% in the past three months alone.

The bank reported its Q4 results on Dec. 3. On an adjusted basis, TD earned 2.97 billion CAD (over $2.32 billion) in net income, slightly higher than the 2.95 billion CAD ($2.31 billion) it made a year earlier. For the entire year, it earned 9.97 billion CAD (roughly $7.8 billion), a little more than 20% lower than the year before.

What’s more, Toronto-Dominion’s U.S. retail banking business accounted for roughly 30% of its overall net income during the fourth quarter, raking in 871 million CAD ($658 million). Unfortunately, it was 27% lower than a year earlier. However, its Canadian retail banking was 3% higher YOY.

The most important figure in the bank’s Q4 report, though, was the steep drop in its provision for credit losses, which fell to 971 million CAD ($760 million) from 2.19 billion CAD ($1.72 billion) at the end of the third quarter ending on July 31 (Page 7).

Also, on a positive note, analysts expected TD to earn $1.27 during the quarter. It beat that estimate by 33 cents.

Once the U.S. economy returns to normal, Toronto-Dominion’s U.S. retail business ought to make a bigger contribution to the bank’s bottom line. And, let’s not forget that the bank also owns 13.5% of Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW).

In the meantime, enjoy its 4.3% dividend yield. Out of all of the Canadian stocks on the market, TD is definitely a solid pick.

Thomson Reuters (TRI) news papers folded and arranged in row like books on a shelf. gray background.

Next on my list of some of the best Canadian stocks is TRI stock. In a challenging operating environment, Thomson Reuters reported excellent Q3 results on Nov. 3.

On the top line, sales grew by 2% during the quarter to $1.44 billion — and 3% if you exclude currency. On the bottom line, it earned 39 cents a share, 44% higher than a year earlier and 48% higher if you exclude currency.

In fiscal 2019, Thomson Reuters generated 79% of its $5.9 billion in revenue in the United States. So, even though TRI is controlled by Canada’s richest family — the Thomsons, who own 66% of the company’s stock — much of the company’s wealth has been earned in the U.S.

Recently, Thomson Reuters also completed a large-scale migration of its business information services to AWS, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud-computing service. The company’s digital transformation will enable it to become a more agile business in the future. As part of the migration, it moved thousands of servers to AWS.

While I don’t think you’re going to hit a homerun owning TRI stock the same way you will with Shopify, you can’t go wrong with this name if preservation of capital is important to you.

FirstService (FSV) cardboard miniature house on table back-lit by sunlight through a window

Last on my list of Canadian stocks is FirstService, a leader in outsourced property services in North America. It’s definitely the smallest of the seven stocks listed in this article. But what it lacks in company size, it makes up for in outsized shareholder returns. So far in 2020, it’s having a great year with a total return of over 41% YTD.

FSV is divided into two operating segments: FirstService Residential, which manages residential communities, and FirstService Brands, a provider of “essential property services” like painting, property damage restoration, flooring, closets and home inspections.

In the trailing 12 months ended Sep. 30, FSV had $2.67 billion in sales, 90% of which was generated in the United States. The rest was made in its home base of Canada. Employing approximately 24,000 people, it had trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA of $268 million, roughly 10% of its top-line sales.

In 1995, the company had $37 million in revenue. Some 24 years later in 2019, revenue was $2.41 billion. That makes for a compound annual growth rate of 19% (Page 5).

You can’t go wrong with businesses that make or save customers time and money. FirstService does both. It’s an excellent long-term buy.

367,2020-12-17T21:36:32+00:00,DoorDash Slips After Citron Calls IPO ‘Most Ridiculous’ of 2020,"(Bloomberg) -- DoorDash Inc.’s shares fell on Thursday after short-seller Citron Research described the food delivery company’s initial public offering as the “most ridiculous” of the year and said the stock is worth a fraction of its current price.

Direct competitors, including Grubhub Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and the recently acquired Postmates, are typically valued at three to six times sales, Citron said in a research report. DoorDash was trading at 19 times. However, accounting standards can vary from company to company.

DoorDash should be worth $40 a share, Citron said, citing intense competition in the market for food delivery, lack of brand loyalty from customers and potential government regulation. That would represent a 74% decline from Thursday’s closing price.

DoorDash has gained 51% since its debut last week. It fell 2.4% to $154.21 on Thursday. DoorDash declined to comment.

The market debut of DoorDash was one of the most anticipated of 2020, already a banner year for startups going public. Back in June, private investors had valued the San Francisco-based company at $16 billion. When it opened for trading on Dec. 9, its fully diluted value topped $68 billion.

DoorDash, the largest food delivery app in the U.S., faces strong competition, notably from Uber and Grubhub. Uber tried to acquire Grubhub this year, until Just Eat Takeaway.com NV intervened. Uber bought Postmates instead.

Now DoorDash is eyeing delivery beyond just meals. The company started ferrying around convenience store items such as toilet paper this spring, which puts it in closer competition with giants such as Amazon.com Inc.

Say there’s a company that, over the past 15 quarters has lost money more often than not, and whose stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of over 1200. Could it be worthy of investor attention?

If the name is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), the answerer is a resounding “yes.” And the spotlight on the company has only brightened after the announcement that it will be added to the S&P 500 (SPX) and S&P 100 (OEX) indices prior to the Dec. 21 trading session.

The addition to the benchmark SPX, which will result in the largest-ever rebalancing of the index, has big implications for the broader market because, despite TSLA’s checkered earnings history, it’s one of the biggest companies in the world.

“Tesla’s inclusion in the S&P 500 is symbolic of its meteoric rise to one of the world’s largest companies by market capitalization and a premier player in the EV (electric vehicle) market,” said Alex Coffey, senior specialist of client and market structure insights at TD Ameritrade.

Weighting Game

While index rebalancing is fairly common, high profile ones have the potential to be major market events, especially as investors have become more tied to indices over the years.

TSLA is the most valuable company ever added to the SPX. It will likely come in at a 1.0% weighting, and index funds are expected to buy around $80 billion of Tesla stock and sell the equivalent in other stocks.

“Tesla being added to the S&P 500 is a factor that could cause a lot of movement in and out of the market,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist with TD Ameritrade. “People get excited about TSLA being added to the S&P 500, but don’t forget there’s something on the other side of this. People will have to be getting out of a lot of other stocks, too, and that could provide pressure. All this can make sudden, quick movements possible in the market one way or the other.”

Story continues

It’s also worth keeping in mind that any stock price gains related to inclusion in stock indices are often short lived, meaning they shouldn’t alter long-term plans that investors have already put in place for their portfolios, Coffey cautioned.

There could also be broader market implication beyond just the rebalancing. Tesla’s stock has been a volatile one, which means that it could make the S&P 500 more volatile as well, especially given Tesla’s size.

Hello And Goodbye

Tesla is replacing Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV) in the broad index. The real estate investment trust (REIT) completed a spinoff of part of itself this week, making AIV no longer representative of the S&P Composite 1500 indices market cap ranges, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a press release.

Although AIV has struggled this year with decreased occupancy rates, lower rental rates, and incremental costs associated with the pandemic, the Wall Street Journal reported that analysts hadn’t identified the company as among likely candidates for removal.

In addition to the SPX, Tesla is also joining the OEX, replacing Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY), which will remain in the broader SPX. The oil and gas company has underperformed the market during the pandemic as demand for crude plummeted.

It seems notable that an electric-vehicle manufacturer is replacing a company that extracts fossil fuels. In addition to the short-term effects from the pandemic, perhaps this also reflects changing attitudes in society about fossil fuels, renewable energy, and climate change.

Bulls And Bears And Books

With Tesla’s stock up more than 640% year-to-date as of December 16 (see chart below), it’s clear that plenty of investors are bullish on the company. But the stock is intensely polarizing, and there have been plenty of bears out there shorting the stock—some of whom got a bit bloodied in this year’s rally.

FIGURE 1: THE IN AND THE OUT. The meteoric rise of Tesla (TSLA—candlestick) has emerged as one of the top investment stories of 2020, culminating in its addition to the S&P 500 (SPX) and S&P 100 (OEX) as of December 21. Shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY—purple line) took it on the chin when it was announced TSLA would be replacing it in the OEX. Shares of Apartment Investment & Management (AIV—blue line) will leave the SPX, due to its having separated into two companies. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

The company’s popularity among the bulls seems to have more to do with what Tesla might become under its visionary CEO Elon Musk than its balance sheet or quarterly performance, meaning that narrative and growth expectations seem more important to the bulls than today’s company fundamentals.

Some investors see Tesla as a climate change play—basically thinking companies such as Tesla will be crucial in helping the planet manage a dire threat. Others may not go that far, but still see the company “helping create a breakthrough in some type of alternative energy that could be applicable beyond electric vehicles,” Coffey said.

This stage in Tesla’s development might be reminiscent of an early Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) before the first dotcom bubble and crash. At the time, AMZN was focused on books, and the company lost 10 cents on every one they sold—the equivalent (in the eyes of some analysts) of selling dollar bills for 90 cents apiece.

Not a great business model, but Amazon has been led by another visionary, Jeff Bezos. Books were only the first step in his plan for a company that has since risen to the top of e-commerce. Sure, Amazon still sells books, but its reach extends to cloud services, grocery delivery, and selling a huge variety of products.

The bulls are hoping for a similar trajectory for Tesla, as the company is more than just an electric vehicle maker. It’s also a cutting edge battery company, in addition to being involved in solar power. Musk also heads aerospace company SpaceX, which has bought battery components and vehicle parts from Tesla.

Fundamentals Rule...Eventually

Still, it seems that Tesla has a long way to go toward justifying its astronomical P/E ratio. Bears tend to think that TSLA is basically a good company but not worth its current valuation. But finance theory tells us that a stock is just the present value of all expected future cash flows. So someday Tesla’s numbers will have to bear out.

But for now, the bulls are in charge. And those investors who have bought Tesla’s stock outright are about to be joined by those who will get exposure to the company through their holdings of index funds.

“While TSLA has long intrigued many investors, it now stands to possibly benefit from a whole new basket of investors who are passively invested in products tracking the S&P 500,” Coffey said.

373,2020-12-16T07:53:31+00:00,Will London's Oxford Street Survive Covid?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- “In a West End town, a dead end world,” sang the Pet Shop Boys in the mid-1980s.

Fast forward 35 years and the electronic-pop duo would be just about right. Covid restrictions and a lack of global tourism have turned the West End, London’s premier shopping and dining district, into a shadow of its former self.

Sales from retail, hospitality and leisure are on course to bring in just 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in the year to March 2021, down from 10 billion pounds in the year earlier, according to the New West End Company, which represents businesses around London’s Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street.

The damage was laid bare on Tuesday when landlord Shaftesbury Plc, which owns about 600 properties, including many shops, bars, restaurants and offices in the area, wrote down the value of its estate by 700 million pounds. It was a wise move.

Starting Wednesday, London moves into the toughest tier of the U.K.’s coronavirus restrictions. Even when rules are eventually softened as more people get vaccinated, city center locations in the U.K. and across Europe will take time to recover. That is going to require some imaginative thinking from landlords, retailers and restaurant operators.

About half of London’s West End retail and hospitality sales come from international tourists. With the vaccine rolling out around the world, some travel is expected to resume. But it’s possible that things won’t start to improve until at least the end of next year.

In the meantime, the U.K. government plans to scrap tax-free shopping for international travelers from Jan. 1, which could cost billions of pounds in sales. Burberry Group Plc, Britain’s biggest luxury brand, warned last month that it would be hit particularly hard, as it would lose its “home market advantage” against Paris- or Milan-based rivals.

This all comes against the backdrop of continued competition from online retailers led by Amazon.com Inc., and digital fast-fashion companies such as Boohoo Group Plc. That’s one reason for the struggles of Philip Green’s Topshop, which occupies a prime position on Oxford Circus.

Story continues

It’s not just tourists who will need to return either. City-center economies rely on office workers. Although there might be a gradual return to the workplace throughout 2021, some form of remote working is likely here to stay. Not only does this threaten hundreds of local shops and eateries, it also makes it harder to repurpose empty stores into offices.

One option for vacant retail and office units is to convert them into residential properties, where demand remains steady for now. Not all Londoners want to flee to the suburbs. If more space becomes available in desirable post codes, the 25,000 people who live in and around the West End could see their numbers grow.

There are some glimmers of hope for retailers who don’t just want to make way for homeowners. Even under the U.K.’s Covid restrictions, fast fashion retailer Primark saw a stream of shoppers in its Tottenham Court Road store last week. At the other end of the market, there was a queue to get into Burberry on Regent Street.

Plus, the shopping mecca has reinvented itself several times before. Consider Selfridges, the West End store that was transformed from comfy to cutting edge in the 1990s under Italian businessman Vittorio Radice. Today, it’s an example of how a department store can thrive in an online world.

The pandemic has also shown how things can be transformed. Over the summer, some local roads were blocked off to cars to make room for more social distancing and al fresco dining. Preserving such changes could continue to elevate the area, as would adding more green space. Stores with big footprints could also be split to house more innovative brands, breaking up the largely mainstream store mix. A third of ground floor units could change over the next two to three years, predicts the New West End Company.

The district doesn’t need to stay a ghost town. But it will need to look very different.

375,2020-12-15T19:42:46+00:00,20 stocks ripe to surge in 2021 because of 3 big tech trends: analyst,"Per the usual, it has been a year of twists and turns for the tech sector.

Companies such as Zoom (Yahoo Finance Company of the Year) and Slack (which will soon be part of Salesforce) have become household names and vital communication tools with people stuck inside during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for notebook computers has gone through the roof with employees working from home, benefiting companies like Dell and HP. The shift to the cloud has only accelerated this year in large part because of the health crisis, lifting the financial fortunes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

And of course, a year of tech wouldn’t be a year of tech if lawmakers weren’t attacking the powers of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon (notably the two former names).

Tech watchers on Wall Street expect a lot of the same trends that lifted the bottom lines — and stock prices — of so many companies to remain intact for 2021. But Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin says three tech trends in particular stand out as potential money-making opportunities even with valuations looking rich.

“Despite increasing risk of a cyclical rotation pressuring tech multiples next year, we remain bullish on the 3-5 year growth prospects for digital darlings. We have a positive bias on software and internet entering 2021 but would not sleep on semiconductors that could have a banner year,” Bracelin wrote in a new note.

Here are three of Bracelin’s key tech trends and potential stock winners.

Theme 1: Digital awakening

Winners: Lemonade; Twilio; Unity Software; nCino; Avalara; Chegg; Zoominfo; Asana, Slack

Bracelin thinks the ongoing shift to the cloud will be a strong growth driver for numerous tech companies next year. He believes enterprises are having a “digital awakening,” as executives realize they haven’t spent enough on the cloud in the lead-up to the pandemic and must now play catch up in order to satisfy new demands in the business.

“The first and most significant thematic that was reinforced by our latest CIO survey was the premise that cloud and digital adoption at 10% of enterprise and 15% of consumer spend entering 2020 would continue to accelerate post pandemic into 2021-2022,” he wrote.

“A key dynamic playing out in the tech world over the next 12 to 18 months is the secular growth areas around cloud and cybersecurity that are seeing eye popping demand trends we have not witnessed in our 20+ years of covering tech stocks on the Street. The accelerated path to the cloud and work from home environment is unprecedented as enterprises and governments of all shapes and sizes adjust to a more virtual workforce for the foreseeable future,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says.

Theme 2: Cloud plus pay

Winners: Bill.com Holdings; BigCommerce Holdings; Shopify; Coupa Software; Tyler Technologies; Ceridian; Intuit; Workday

The digital payments shift is moving beyond the consumer-focused names such as PayPal to enterprises, Bracelin contends. That opens the door for more tech companies to participate in the digital flow of transactions. Bracelin calls this the ‘cloud plus pay’ investing theme.

“The second biggest thematic we are focused on is the rise of business-to-business payments. We see a new class of software-as-a-service models proliferating in 2021 that augment high margin subscription revenue base with new digital payment streams that can help accelerate growth and profitability,” Bracelin says.

The CEO of Intuit (one of Bracelin’s winners) Sasan Goodarzi recently struck an upbeat tone on his business headed into 2021 in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, fueled in part by its $8.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma. It looks like Bracelin may be on the mark, at least when it comes to Intuit.

Theme 3: Digital exhaust

Winners: Snowflake; MongoDB; Alteryx

Bracelin’s “digital exhaust” theme is probably the most emerging one of the three he discusses. But, the underlying drivers of the theme partially explains the impressive response to data cloud play Snowflake’s IPO this year.

“The third thematic that we’re focused on is a byproduct of the accelerating shift to digital and cloud, which is digital exhaust. The vast majority of information created (97%) has historically been stored, processed, or archived. As new mountains of digital exhaust are created, we expect AI will have an increasingly critical role and an entirely new crop of digital disruptors that help convert digital exhaust into actionable insights in real-time,” explains Bracelin.

To this end, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman recently told Yahoo Finance Live his emerging technology is now mission critical for businesses.

“Snowflake is 100% essential, and I am not just saying that because we are Snowflake,” Slootman told Yahoo Finance Live. “If you look at the history of cloud computing, the data later is crucial and essential.”

But Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin says three tech trends in particular stand out as potential money-making opportunities even with valuations looking rich.

“Despite increasing risk of a cyclical rotation pressuring tech multiples next year, we remain bullish on the 3-5 year growth prospects for digital darlings. We have a positive bias on software and internet entering 2021 but would not sleep on semiconductors that could have a banner year,” Bracelin wrote in a new note.

Here are three of Bracelin’s key tech trends and potential stock winners.

Theme 1: Digital awakening

Winners: Lemonade; Twilio; Unity Software; nCino; Avalara; Chegg; Zoominfo; Asana, Slack

Bracelin thinks the ongoing shift to the cloud will be a strong growth driver for numerous tech companies next year. He believes enterprises are having a “digital awakening,” as executives realize they haven’t spent enough on the cloud in the lead-up to the pandemic and must now play catch up in order to satisfy new demands in the business.

“The first and most significant thematic that was reinforced by our latest CIO survey was the premise that cloud and digital adoption at 10% of enterprise and 15% of consumer spend entering 2020 would continue to accelerate post pandemic into 2021-2022,” he wrote.

“A key dynamic playing out in the tech world over the next 12 to 18 months is the secular growth areas around cloud and cybersecurity that are seeing eye popping demand trends we have not witnessed in our 20+ years of covering tech stocks on the Street. The accelerated path to the cloud and work from home environment is unprecedented as enterprises and governments of all shapes and sizes adjust to a more virtual workforce for the foreseeable future,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says.

Theme 2: Cloud plus pay

Winners: Bill.com Holdings; BigCommerce Holdings; Shopify; Coupa Software; Tyler Technologies; Ceridian; Intuit; Workday

The digital payments shift is moving beyond the consumer-focused names such as PayPal to enterprises, Bracelin contends. That opens the door for more tech companies to participate in the digital flow of transactions. Bracelin calls this the ‘cloud plus pay’ investing theme.

“The second biggest thematic we are focused on is the rise of business-to-business payments. We see a new class of software-as-a-service models proliferating in 2021 that augment high margin subscription revenue base with new digital payment streams that can help accelerate growth and profitability,” Bracelin says.

The CEO of Intuit (one of Bracelin’s winners) Sasan Goodarzi recently struck an upbeat tone on his business headed into 2021 in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, fueled in part by its $8.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma. It looks like Bracelin may be on the mark, at least when it comes to Intuit.

Theme 3: Digital exhaust

Winners: Snowflake; MongoDB; Alteryx

Bracelin’s “digital exhaust” theme is probably the most emerging one of the three he discusses. But, the underlying drivers of the theme partially explains the impressive response to data cloud play Snowflake’s IPO this year.

“The third thematic that we’re focused on is a byproduct of the accelerating shift to digital and cloud, which is digital exhaust. The vast majority of information created (97%) has historically been stored, processed, or archived. As new mountains of digital exhaust are created, we expect AI will have an increasingly critical role and an entirely new crop of digital disruptors that help convert digital exhaust into actionable insights in real-time,” explains Bracelin.

To this end, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman recently told Yahoo Finance Live his emerging technology is now mission critical for businesses.

“Snowflake is 100% essential, and I am not just saying that because we are Snowflake,” Slootman told Yahoo Finance Live. “If you look at the history of cloud computing, the data later is crucial and essential.”

377,2020-12-14T21:00:00+00:00,"Trucks in China Are Watching If Drivers Doze, Speed or Slack Off","(Bloomberg) -- Trucks in China connected to G7’s fleet-management network do more than just haul goods across the vast nation.

Using Internet of Things technology, they can employ anti-fatigue cameras to call out bad driving, built-in advanced driver-assistance systems to send warnings about insufficient space between vehicles on highways, and real-time cargo weighing to prevent stealing.

Beijing-based G7 aims to monitor all steps along a product’s logistics journey, from warehouse to delivery, remotely. Covid-19, which has seen a jump in online shopping as people stay home and avoid crowds, has presented an added opportunity, with customers including FedEx Corp., Amazon.com Inc., China Post and Walmart Inc. more focused than ever on security and tracing, according to G7 founder Zhai Xuehun.

It’s ultimately aimed at making logistics more efficient. Reducing the cost of transporting goods means higher margins for not only trucking companies but also manufacturers. Consumers benefit too through lower costs and products that arrive on time and in better shape.

Logistics costs in China accounted for around 15% of economic expansion in 2019, versus single digits in Europe and the U.S., a discrepancy that underscores the imperative for China to lower the expense, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Teo.

“Logistics demand in China is growing rapidly, driven by the fast growth of e-commerce,” Teo said. “The number of parcels that logistics companies have to handle is rising, so there’s a need to improve efficiency in order to lower unit costs.”

G7, which was founded in 2010 and takes its name from the G7 Beijing–Urumqi Expressway, the world’s longest desert highway, collects a plethora of other fleet information too, ranging from how many times drivers use their cellphones while on the road to how many times they stop to refill gas and what electronic payment methods they rely on.

Its technology can also provide real-time updates on a truck’s payload and temperature, helping to ensure goods that need to remain cold, for example, are delivered in optimum condition. Artificial intelligence is also used to help lower the rate of accidents by determining whether drivers are losing focus based on the frequency of their blinks. If the driver’s behavior fails to response to a buzz alert, service hotline staff will place a call urging them to take a rest.

“There’s never been so much emphasis put on China’s circulation industry since the country was established,” Ren Xingzhou, former head of the market-economy research unit under the Development Research Center of the State Council, said at a conference last month. “The efficiency of circulation and logistics directly impacts overall economic development.”

G7, which has already attracted backers including Temasek Holdings Pte and Tencent Holdings Ltd., is working on plans to start a new round of funding and may consider an initial public offering at some point, Chief Financial Officer Zhang Jielong said, declining to elaborate. The company’s last fundraising round was in 2018 when it raised money at $1.2 billion, Zhang said.

And demand from investors, particularly in China, to get in on the ground floor of the technologies that will power tomorrow is rising. SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund 2 is leading a $113.5 million investment round in a California-based startup called Flock Freight that seeks to change the way goods get trucked around the U.S., a person familiar said earlier this month.

Other G7 backers include Eastern Bell Venture Capital Management Co., Hopu Investment Management Co., Bank of China Ltd. and Tsinghua Holdings Venture Capital Co. The company has raised a total of $510 million over six rounds, according to Crunchbase.

“The next decade will bring an era of deepening digitalization,” Zhai said from G7’s headquarters, where a wall-sized screen displays real-time data and images of the some 1.8 million vehicles connected to the company’s platform. “The digital and visual management of logistic fleets will be our historic contribution to the industry.”

378,2020-12-14T19:12:08+00:00,China Regulators Review Huya’s $6 Billion Deal to Buy DouYu,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s regulators said they are reviewing Huya Inc.’s proposal to acquire game-streaming rival DouYu International Holdings Ltd., part of a crackdown on anti-competitive behavior in the country’s technology industry that throws the $6 billion transaction into question.

Guangzhou-based Huya offered to buy its domestic competitor in October, proposing an all-stock transaction that would have created a combined business valued at about $11 billion at the time. Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., a shareholder in both companies, would have had about 68% of the merged business’s voting shares.

Regulators announced their review of the Huya acquisition on Monday as they levied fines against a Tencent affiliate and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. for their M&A transactions. The two companies were fined 500,000 yuan ($76,500) each over failing to declare past acquisitions under the country’s anti-monopoly laws. The antitrust agency singled out the Huya deal during a lengthy Q&A posted on its website explaining why it was tightening oversight of internet-sector deals in general.

A Huya spokesperson said the company has applied to the antitrust watchdog for a review of the proposed merger and will cooperate with the regulator. DouYu representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Their combined market valuations are now about $8.5 billion. DouYu’s U.S.-traded shares fell 2.4% at 2:03 p.m. in New York while Huya slid less than 1%.

The transaction was negotiated before the recent government crackdown and was aimed at creating the country’s dominant live-streamed gaming leader akin to Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch. Consolidation would likely have improved the profitability of the business: The streaming networks live or die by the popularity of star players and the virtual tips and gifts that fans buy for them, leading to intense bidding wars for the most-recognized names.

Story continues

They are fighting over a prime position in the world’s biggest gaming market. China’s game-streaming is projected to generate 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) in revenue this year, according to iResearch.

As part of the deal, Tencent planned to assign interest in its own live-streaming business, Penguin e-Sports, to the combined entity for $500 million. Together, the three platforms would have unrivaled leadership in game-streaming, though they would still compete for users’ attention with hotter services like TikTok’s domestic twin Douyin and Bilibili Inc.

Huya and DouYu said in October that the deal was expected to close in the first half of 2021. Both boards of directors had unanimously approved the transaction and the chief executive officers of both companies had agreed to support it.

380,2020-12-14T08:26:18+00:00,"China Fines Alibaba, Tencent Unit Under Anti-Monopoly Laws","(Bloomberg) -- China’s antitrust watchdog fined Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and a Tencent Holdings Ltd. unit over a pair of years-old acquisitions and said it’s reviewing an impending Tencent-led merger, signaling Beijing’s intention to tighten oversight of internet sector deals.

The State Administration for Market Regulation said Monday it’s reviewing the combination of DouYu International Holdings Ltd. with Huya Inc., which could create a Chinese game streaming leader akin to Amazon’s Twitch. It fined Alibaba 500,000 yuan ($76,500) for failing to seek approval before increasing its stake in department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. to 73.79% in 2017, while China Literature Ltd., the e-books business spun off by Tencent, was also censured over a previous deal, according to a statement.

The penalties come after regulators last month declared their intention to increase scrutiny of China’s largest tech corporations with new anti-monopoly rules. Beijing in November unveiled draft regulations that establish a framework for curbing anti-competitive behavior such as colluding on sharing sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to eliminate competitors. Shares in Alibaba and Tencent extended losses and closed down more than 2.5%.

“Investment and takeovers are important means for development and growth of internet companies,” the regulator said in the statement. “The above-mentioned companies have a large influence in the industry, carry out many investments and takeovers, have specialized legal teams and should be familiar with the regulations governing M&A. Their failure to actively declare has a relatively severe impact.”

Beijing’s heightened scrutiny is spurring fears of a broader crackdown on the country’s largest firms. On Monday, shares in No. 3 internet company Meituan plunged 3.8% after the People’s Daily wrote an editorial slamming the industry’s preoccupation with growing traffic and volumes in areas such as grocery delivery, at the expense of real scientific innovation.

China Literature agreed in 2018 to buy New Classics Media for as much as 15.5 billion yuan to expand in filmed content.

The companies had failed to seek approval for the deals, which aren’t deemed anti-competitive, the antitrust regulator said Monday.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:

Alibaba’s ability to strengthen its domestic e-commerce ecosystem through M&A may be significantly weakened on rising anti-monopoly scrutiny, underlined by a 500,000 yuan fine by the State Administration for Market Regulation on Monday for failing to seek approval for its stake acquisitions of Intime Retail in 2014-18. While the amount is immaterial to Alibaba, retroactive application of new anti-competitive rules announced in November may be a stern warning to toe the line in future.

Huya in October agreed to buy DouYu in an all-share deal and Tencent, which currently owns stakes in both companies, was expected to hold about 68% of the merged business’s voting shares. That would have given the WeChat operator control over the leader in the live-streamed gaming market, estimated to generate 30 billion yuan in revenue this year, according to the latest numbers from iResearch.

An affiliate of SF Holding Co. was also fined for not declaring a takeover of a competitor, Monday’s statement showed.

The two technology giants, neighbors in the Seattle area and rivals in cloud computing and business software, have each spent much of the last two years announcing increasingly aggressive climate targets, including dueling umbrella organizations for companies willing to do their part to avert the catastrophic warming of the planet. On Wednesday, Microsoft said it had signed onto Amazon’s pact, alongside consumer products giant Unilever Plc and several other new signatories.

Amazon, long a laggard among its peers in publicly addressing its impact on the environment, reversed course in recent years, bolstering an internal sustainability team and vowing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. The company also invited others interested in matching that commitment to sign on to what it calls the Climate Pledge, a forum for comparing notes on best practices and climate-friendly investment opportunities.

Microsoft, meanwhile, has said it hopes to use new technologies to remove from the atmosphere all of the greenhouse gases the company was responsible for generating during its entire existence.

Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s Chief Environmental Officer, said the software maker’s previous pledges already more than meet the Climate Pledge standard, but it’s important to send a signal with participation in Amazon’s effort, particularly because less than 5% of Fortune 500 companies have promised to get to net-zero emissions.

“There’s been this false perception that there is this kind of climate race,” he said. “There is a climate race, but it’s not between tech companies, it’s between every company and society and time.”

The other new Climate Pledgers make for an eclectic mix. Coca-Cola European Partners, the largest Coca-Cola bottler by revenue, joined. So did Harbour Air Ltd., a tour and charter float plane company based near Vancouver, Canada. (Business boosters have long pushed for more frequent routes between Vancouver and Seattle.)

386,2020-12-09T19:41:42+00:00,"Microsoft, Unilever Join Amazon Vow to Fight Climate Change","(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has added a competitor to its year-old coalition of companies pledging to reduce their contribution to climate change: Microsoft Corp.

The two technology giants, neighbors in the Seattle area and rivals in cloud computing and business software, have each spent much of the last two years announcing increasingly aggressive climate targets, including dueling umbrella organizations for companies willing to do their part to avert the catastrophic warming of the planet. On Wednesday, Microsoft said it had signed onto Amazon’s pact, alongside consumer products giant Unilever Plc and several other new signatories.

Amazon, long a laggard among its peers in publicly addressing its impact on the environment, reversed course in recent years, bolstering an internal sustainability team and vowing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you about another power center in America, Michael, which kind of concerns our audience maybe more directly, and you alluded to this, which is corporate America. And, you know, this is tricky stuff because people have good intentions here and there is some action, but I'd love to get your assessment of corporate America's responses in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing.

MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: Well, look, it was great in terms of the immediate aftermath. You know, like hey, this is powerful. You know, we got more monies to develop toward people being brought in. We want to be more diverse. We want to see a broader swath of the universe participate. All that stuff is great.

But, you know, when you get down to brass tacks and knuckles, how are you changing your process? Who are your VPs? Who are the people in the room? Who are the people who can green light projects? Who are the people who can have real resources behind your intent to do well?

So at that level, it means you've got to restructure, rejigger what's going on. It can't just be surface or cosmetic. It's got to be more internal. The skeletons, the bones have to be readjusted so that the flesh that is put upon them can look a bit different.

And so corporate America has to ask, how are you making so much money at the expense of these very Black people who are dying and all you're giving back is a small sliver, a small percentage? Because be rest assured what the corporations are doing in response to Black Lives Matter and saying we're going to pledge money is barely anything in compensation for the amounts of money that Black people put into their pockets, right, across the board.

And so that recognition means you got to do a little bit more, whether you're a sports league or whether you are a, you know, financial-services business or whether you're with clothes or shoes or entertainment. Black folk are sustaining you in far higher numbers than you're willing to pay back or give back or recognize in your bottom-line budgets for Black Lives Matter.

So again, Martin Luther King Jr. said, yo, the civil rights bill didn't cost you nothing. Voting rights, that ain't costing you nothing. What I'm asking for now, economic parity, you don't deal with that. And in an aftermath of his death, housing-- the housing fair act-- the fair act for housing passed, right, '68. That cost something. That means you've got to give up your rapacious, you know, individualism or your rapacious corporate practices when it comes to real-estate companies that are redlining and directing Black people towards certain neighborhoods and ripping them off and taking their money without giving them the bang on their buck.

So all that stuff means it costs something. And until it costs you something as corporate America, you really ain't doing anything to make a difference in terms of race in America.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/corporate-america-truly-addressing-racial-110000310.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'BRK-A.US', 'BRK-B.US', 'C-PIC.US', 'C-PJ.US', 'C-PK.US', 'C-PS.US', 'C.US', 'GS-PA.US', 'GS-PD.US', 'GS-PJ.US', 'GS-PK.US', 'GS-PN.US', 'GS.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'HD.US', 'JNJ.US', 'JPM-PC.US', 'JPM-PD.US']","['AMERICA', 'CORPORATE AMERICA', 'MICHAEL ERIC DYSON']","{'polarity': 0.988, 'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.092}"
390,2020-12-08T15:29:03+00:00,Solaris (SOI) Teams Up With Amazon for Machine-Learning Platform,"Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. SOI announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, to shed light on oilfield data for its customers to gain insight on equipment performance and use it to predict issues.

The oilfield data comprises materials and storage usage, trend analysis, equipment and performance analytics, and predictive maintenance features.

The cloud-based data platform, which can analyze unprecedented levels of data created by operators and oilfield service providers as well as enable customization of data capture and display, is expected to serve as a useful tool for analysis and data interpretation for customers. As a result, the data analytics platform is likely to improve security measures, efficiency and eventually reduce costs of wells.

Further, the company leveraged several AWS analytics capabilities to deliver these personalized data solutions to provide flexibility to customers. Amazon Timestream, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon QuickSight, Amazon Athena, Amazon SageMaker and AWS’s machine learning service aid data scientists and developers to build, train and deploy machine-learning algorithms swiftly and efficiently.

Solaris believes that AWS Cloud will offer increased efficacy as well as lower expenditure. The platform will remodel complex business and operating systems for a more sustainable energy future. With the application of AWS, the Houston-based company will utilize a complete portfolio of capabilities such as analytics and machine-learning services to obtain greater insights into inventory to reduce waste and prevent issues from happening.

Notably, the innovative data analytics tool is a major factor to generate sustainable and quantifiable efficiencies for customers to maximize cash flows. Through its use, Solaris aims to leverage machine learning to further automate processes, apply predictive maintenance and achieve more at lesser costs.

392,2020-12-07T22:58:04+00:00,"Uber Sells Self-Driving Unit to Aurora, Takes Startup Stake","(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. sold its self-driving car division to Aurora Innovation Inc. and took a stake in the startup, pulling back from its vision for a fleet of autonomous taxis to focus on turning a quarterly profit next year after the pandemic crushed revenue.

The deal will value Aurora at $10 billion, according to people familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified discussing private information. In exchange for investing $400 million in Aurora, Uber will get a 26% ownership stake in the company. That number increases to 40% when counting the stakes held by the employees and investors of Uber’s autonomous driving division. Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi and one other yet-to-be-named person representing Uber will join Aurora’s board.

The price tag is a comedown for Uber, whose self-driving division, Advanced Technologies Group, raised money last year at a $7.25 billion valuation. The agreement with Aurora values the unit at just $4 billion, following Uber’s investment. The deal, expected to close during the first quarter, also guarantees that when Aurora releases its self-driving vehicles, they’ll launch on Uber’s network.

Shares of Uber fell were mostly unchanged in after-hours trading Monday. The stock closed at $53.80 in New York and has jumped 81% this year.

By adding Uber’s self-driving car unit, Aurora will gain hundreds of engineers and access to one of the world’s largest ride-hailing networks. For Uber, which has slashed high-profile cash-burning initiatives this year in a push to turn a profit in 2021, the deal will give it a significant stake in one of Silicon Valley’s most promising autonomous driving startups.

In recent months, the unit’s long time frame and high costs concerned Uber’s investors SoftBank Group Corp., Benchmark and others, who have been privately urging Khosrowshahi to reconsider the autonomous driving strategy. During ATG’s short history, it has made progress building and testing autonomous driving systems, but also struggled amid a damaging lawsuit brought by Waymo, a tragic pedestrian fatality caused by one of its autonomous cars and the sector-wide reckoning that even the most basic self-driving vehicles will take significantly more time and money to develop than previously expected.

Story continues

The deal is similar in structure to one Uber made earlier this year with Lime. Uber offloaded its cash-burning Jump bicycle division to the scooter company and invested $170 million in Lime to ensure a payout if, some day, the company becomes profitable.

Aurora and Uber announced the deal in a joint statement after markets closed Monday. The companies said the group will focus on driverless trucking first and later turn to more complicated light vehicles carrying passengers.

“It works well for both of us,” said Aurora CEO Chris Urmson. “We’re excited to have them team with us, and we’re excited to have Dara join our board.”Aurora’s co-founders have a deep history in the self-driving industry. Urmson previously led Google’s self-driving team, which became Waymo. Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson directed Tesla Inc.’s autopilot efforts. And Chief Technology Officer Drew Bagnell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, was part of the 2015 academic exodus that formed the Uber’s ATG team. Bagnell left ATG to co-found Aurora.Aurora earlier this summer expanded testing on public roads from California and Pennsylvania to include Texas with an initial focus on completing long-haul, commercial trips instead of the more complicated urban maneuvers where there are more variables and opportunities for failure.Having raised $765 million from investors including Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Hyundai Motor Co., Aurora was valued at more than $3 billion last year, according to research firm PitchBook. Amazon.com Inc., which purchased its own self-driving startup, Zoox, earlier this year, is also an investor.

Aurora has roughly 600 employees, while Uber’s ATG group has about 1,200 employees, many of them based in Pittsburgh, long an epicenter of robotics thanks to Carnegie Mellon University.

Khosrowshahi had sold about 14% of ATG to partners SoftBank, Toyota Motor Corp. and Denso Corp. for $1 billion in 2019, but the unit was burning roughly $500 million a year and was set to exhaust funds by the end of next year, people familiar told Bloomberg this fall.

Even after combining forces, Aurora and ATG face stiff competition from more developed and better funded rivals. Waymo, which has logged tens of millions of miles in more than two dozen cities, announced earlier this year it had raised money from auto manufacturers and private equity groups to expand to new locations.TechCruch earlier reported that Aurora and Uber were discussing a deal.

395,2020-12-06T22:00:13+00:00,These Two Words Will Strike Fear Into Gadget Makers This Christmas,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Global electronics companies hoping to enjoy a spike in sales during a pandemic-inflicted Christmas need to avoid the one thing that stands in the way of a bonanza: shortages.

The shuttering of factories, a reduction in flights, and rolling lockdowns mean that the robustness of a company’s supply chain will end up being of critical strategic advantage. The list of tech giants looking to mitigate, or leverage, challenges in procuring and delivering products during this shopping season reads like a Who’s Who of global brands.Sony Corp., Nintendo Co., Microsoft Corp., HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Xiaomi Corp. and Apple Inc. are among those facing possible lost sales simply because the companies that supply components, assemble devices, or transport their products across the globe are coping with unprecedented difficulties due to Covid-19.

The shuttering of factories, a reduction in flights, and rolling lockdowns mean that the robustness of a company’s supply chain will end up being of critical strategic advantage. The list of tech giants looking to mitigate, or leverage, challenges in procuring and delivering products during this shopping season reads like a Who’s Who of global brands.Sony Corp., Nintendo Co., Microsoft Corp., HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Xiaomi Corp. and Apple Inc. are among those facing possible lost sales simply because the companies that supply components, assemble devices, or transport their products across the globe are coping with unprecedented difficulties due to Covid-19.

On Dec. 21, Tesla stock will be added to the S&P 500 index as by far the most valuable company ever. Tesla (TSLA) badge on back end of red Tesla car

Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com

The S&P 500 index is the most popular index of U.S. stocks. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is by far the largest ETF in the world by assets under management.

I am among many skeptics that believe Tesla is a great company but has a stock price that has been caught in a bubble for more than a year now. As an S&P 500 index ETF investor myself, I am concerned about the danger Tesla could pose to the S&P 500 once the bubble bursts.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Tesla Stock and the S&P 500

The S&P 500 is a collection of 500 of the largest US-listed stocks. The index is market cap-weighted, meaning the formula used to calculate its price is based on the market caps of the component companies.

7 Growth Stocks Flying Under the Radar

A stock’s weighting in the index is calculated by dividing a company’s individual market cap by the total market caps of all 500 companies in the index.

After gaining 785% in the last year, Tesla’s market cap is now around $550 billion. At its current valuation, Tesla is nearly three times larger than the largest stock ever added to the S&P 500.

The fact that Tesla’s valuation is so high yet it hasn’t been eligible for the S&P 500 until this year is extremely telling. Tesla needed to put together a string of four quarters of profitability to gain eligibility. After 17 years, it finally hit that profitability mark this year.

Investors have never valued an unprofitable company anywhere near the levels Tesla is valued now. Not Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) or any other auto stock in history. Not Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or any other tech stock in history.

Tesla’s Initial Weighting

Story continues

There’s a good chance Tesla could continue to rally to new highs between now and its Dec. 21 addition date. That rally would only add to the company’s bloated market cap. It could also potentially create even more problems with its inclusion.

However, for now let’s assume Tesla is added at a market cap of around $550 billion. It would immediately have the sixth-largest weighting in the S&P 500.

As an owner of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VOO) myself, here’s what that means for me. Overnight, I will go from having no part of Tesla in my portfolio to Tesla being my sixth-largest holding.

Here’s why that’s a problem. Back on May 1, Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously said “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

I often disagree with Musk, but this time I think he got it right. Regardless, Tesla shares have skyrocketed another 317% in seven months since that tweet.

That price Musk said was “too high” now represents a split adjusted price of around $152. In other words, it represents about 74% downside from current levels. And remember, this is not the rantings of a crazy Tesla short seller. This is the price Musk himself said was too high earlier this year.

Back in September, I compared Tesla’s valuation to other auto stocks and high-growth tech stocks and arrived at a reasonable valuation of $141. That number is roughly in-line with the level Musk said was too high.

That level represents about 76% downside, so Musk and I seem to be on the same page. Tesla could easily have 70% to 80% downside when the bubble bursts. And before any Tesla bulls leave me angry comments about that target, remember I’m just agreeing with Musk.

How Much Could a Tesla Crash Hurt?

Tesla is a divisive stock. Plenty of people are believers and plenty of people are skeptics. But pretty much every American with money invested for retirement has significant exposure to the S&P 500. I want to know just how much the bursting of the Tesla bubble could hurt my VOO ETF investment.

The S&P 500’s total market cap is somewhere in the neighborhood of $32 trillion. Assuming Tesla would overshoot to the downside a bit if the stock crashes, how much of an impact would an 85% drop in Tesla’s share price have on the S&P 500 as a whole?

At current prices, 85% of Tesla’s market cap is worth about $460 billion. Crunching the numbers, $460 billion divided by $32 trillion is about 1.4%. So Tesla could potentially drag down the S&P 500 by around 1.4% all by itself.

Bigger Than Tesla

Of course, in reality the fallout of a Tesla stock crash would likely be much worse given the pain it would inflict on so many investors. There would certainly be ripple effects on other stocks.

I think there’s a good chance the S&P 500 inclusion will mark the ultimate top in Tesla stock for at least the next several years. However, as an S&P 500 index ETF investor, I’m hoping that top will simply mark the beginning of a decade of underperformance for Tesla rather than a volatile bubble-bursting event that could drag down the rest of the market.

402,2020-12-01T09:07:26+00:00,Should Your Bank Deliver Your Groceries and Meals Too?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Russia’s most valuable listed company is testing the limits of corporate reinvention. Traditional lenders everywhere are adding payments apps and digital banking offerings to see off tech upstarts. State-owned giant Sberbank PJSC wants to go much further to become Russia’s answer to Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent and, well, Sberbank — all rolled into one. Watching long-time boss Herman Gref address investors this week in the Silicon Valley uniform of jeans, t-shirt and white trainers on a circular stage against a changing virtual background, it was hard to imagine this was once the Soviet savings monopoly, a monolith better known for bureaucracy and sullen service than tech prowess. In September, it dropped the word “bank” from corporate branding. Now, it aims to become one of the top three e-commerce players nationally by 2023 — delivering groceries and more alongside its regular banking, wealth management and insurance business.

The logic isn’t hard to understand. Facing limits on its reach abroad and low interest rates that could weigh on margins for years, Sberbank wants to make more of its clout at home, where almost two-thirds of Russians are clients. Rival state-owned lender VTB Group too has diversified, expanding into grain trading. Yet by stretching into everything from cloud services to food delivery, taxis and even in-house hardware, Gref is pushing not just Sberbank’s aspirations, but what Moscow overseers will allow. Oversight questions are growing, and political risk is building too.

Even if everything goes as planned, conglomerates often trade at a discount, suggesting they rarely deliver the value they should.

Sberbank has already seen a remarkable transformation even before this effort to compete head-to-head with the likes of its one-time partner Yandex NV. Over more than a decade under Gref, a liberal reformer and former economy minister, the bank has bolstered its bottom line, revived its operating systems and branch networks, weathered European and U.S. sanctions, and now a pandemic. Impressive, even if it has had to delay a 1 trillion-ruble ($13 billion) net profit target.

Story continues

Sberbank’s banking app is the third most popular in Russia, as measured by monthly users, according to Gref. Clients are interacting with the lender more frequently. That’s good news, given engagement is a vital ingredient for any superapp-in-waiting. There’s the benefit of an extensive branch network too, in a vast country where actually making the deliveries has been a major brake on internet shopping.

Yet a state bank isn’t necessarily the right owner for many of these businesses. Yes, the race is open for online shopping dominance in Russia, a country where few international tech heavyweights have made headway. But e-commerce has a propensity to gobble up cash that may extend beyond the 4% of equity signaled by Sberbank for the three-year period. The bank has already spent some $2 billion on acquisitions and tech to build a non-banking business that includes online cinema Okko and media group Rambler.

Despite Gref’s reassurances otherwise, it’s unclear the bank can expand swiftly on all of these fronts without adding risk to the financial business where Sberbank still has room to grow in everything from loans to insurance. After all, banking will still account for roughly 70% of net operating income in 2023. Conglomerates elsewhere offer cautionary tales.

Russia’s cautious central bank has already warned about the risk of creating new monopolies and fretted about the rapid expansion into non-financial services. That may well translate into tougher disclosures standards or capital requirements. Sberbank, after all, holds nearly half of Russia’s retail deposits. It may have looked to Asian heavyweights for inspiration, but there it was big tech that drove the disruption, not the other way around. Most of those companies, like Grab or Gojek in Southeast Asia, have expanded through partnerships, rather than full ownership. The going hasn’t been smooth either, as Ant Group’s initial public offering showed.Finally, there’s Kremlin risk. Russia wants and badly needs digital innovation, but state coffers need dividends too. Sberbank says it will pay out half its earnings, and any sign of that sum shrinking finance tech experiments may prove politically costly. So too will any slip-up that hurts consumers.Tech is necessary, tempting and potentially accretive. It can also prove a distraction, with economic uncertainty ahead, for a major lender that still has room to grow within financial services. Watching Sberbank has reminded me of a conversation I had a year or so ago with an Uber executive. When I asked why superapps weren’t catching on faster outside Asia, he paused. Sometimes, he replied, just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.

ORAN recently collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the cloud computing platform of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN — to facilitate the digital transformation of enterprise firms to enable them to gain more mileage from various cloud-based applications. The strategic partnership is also likely to standardize and optimize applications within the AWS environments to help enterprises accelerate innovation, reduce risks and improve efficiency levels.

The collaboration will offer a one-stop solution to customers by integrating data analytics and cybersecurity solutions under a single platform. While Orange boasts profound industry experience in cybersecurity and cloud-native applications, AWS has created a niche market in the cloud computing domain with a mix of infrastructure-as-a-service and packaged software-as-a-service offerings. Together the firms will work in unison to fast-track a seamless transition for customers to the cloud.

Per the agreement, a Cloud Center of Excellence will be built on AWS to jointly coordinate an extensive training and certification program for more than 3,000 Orange Business Services domain experts. This, in turn, will help eliminate multivendor complexities, stimulate digitization and enable customers to explore innovation to improve cloud applications on AWS. In addition, continued investments by Orange to augment its cloud-native skills will help customers to boost on-demand delivery and flexibility, improve resiliency, and optimize costs.

With a unique set of capabilities across connectivity, design, migration, security and local delivery, Orange Business Services offers a definite roadmap to help customers leverage the breadth and depth of AWS services to quickly develop and deploy cloud native applications. The tie-up between the two firms will facilitate consumption-based interfaces for seamless orchestration, network exposure and service assurance. This is expected to improve the service capabilities of the French carrier and enable it to significantly scale a traditional wireless network for varied customers. Notably, Orange Business Services is well poised to support the transition of global businesses across every stage of the data lifecycle from collection, transport, storage and processing to analysis and sharing, thereby translating to incremental revenues in the long run.

405,2020-11-25T13:39:01+00:00,Colin Kaepernick will not play in the NFL again: Emmanuel Acho,"In this episode of Influencers, Andy Serwer speaks with former NFL player and 'Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man' author, Emmanuel Acho, about Colin Kaepernick's future in football and what NFL owners can do to address racial tension within the league.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: When you had Roger Goodell on, Emmanuel-- I think it was in August-- he offered an apology to Colin Kaepernick. But Colin Kaepernick still has not been signed by a team. Is this collusion? Do you think he'll ever go back to the NFL?

EMMANUEL ACHO: No, I don't think Colin Kaepernick will play in the NFL, but there are so many variables to this. What do I mean by that?

In the NFL, every organization runs a cost-benefit analysis. How much will it cost us to have you on organization, and how much will you benefit us? So if you're an NFL organization, especially four years removed, in regards to Colin Kaepernick, now you're weighing the risk-reward. He'll come in, and obviously, he'll be anywhere from a second- to a third-string quarterback right now.

Is having Colin Kaepernick as a second- or third-string quarterback worth the questions that every player will now get asked, that we will now get asked, and is it worth the distraction that the media will create? Not Colin Kaepernick, necessarily, but the media will create.

So, because of that, I don't think that Colin Kaepernick would get signed. I also think that-- I don't know-- sometimes there's an impasse. Remember. Let's talk Cam Newton for a second. Cam Newton didn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wanted to be a starter. And as a result, there was only one team that wanted to make him a starter.

Eric Reid, someone who has been proudly known to be standing by Colin Kaepernick, very justifiably so-- the Washington Football Team-- they offered him a place on their practice squad. Eric Reid turned it down because Eric Reid views himself as a starter. And so, just because you want to play doesn't necessarily mean that the position will be offered to you that you do, in fact, want.

Story continues

So, because of all the nuances regarding that, I personally don't see Colin Kaepernick playing in the NFL.

- So it was the situation where the owners didn't want him for a while, and now Father Time has entered into the equation as well a little bit, perhaps, too.

EMMANUEL ACHO: I would say it's a combination of everything. The owners don't want what the media will bring with that, number one.

And number two-- it's so detailed, and it's so multifaceted, but until the owners can also get their fans to understand it wasn't about disrespecting the flag-- it was about a just cause-- then the owners, who were always worried about bottom line, who were always worried about their dollars, now are gonna run the risk of losing their dollars for the sake of Colin Kaepernick. And unfortunately, owners just aren't that selfless. You don't become a billionaire by being selfless. That's not how it works.

- And as you were saying, too, Emmanuel-- different cities, different owners, different politics. It's all part of that equation, as you said.

You mentioned the 32 owners. Only two of them are people of color, and only three non-interim head coaches are black. Wow. Seems like there's a long way to go there, too, right?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, but the issue, Andy, is that so many people think the NFL is a meritocracy. However hard you work, you'll earn your success. It's not. It's really based off nepotism and cronyism.

Nepotism, you hire your family, and cronyism, you hire your friends. Historically, if the NFL was founded by white men, white men are hiring their family-- nepotism-- white men. They're hiring their friends-- cronyism-- white men. So how do you think that the NFL will change if it's historically founded by white men who are looking out for other white men? It won't.

And so, that's why it's not a coincidence when you see only 3 out of 32 coaches, full-time, who began the season, or whatever the statistic may be, are black. That's not a coincidence. That's just the way in which our world at large works, and the NFL is a reflection of that.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/colin-kaepernick-not-play-nfl-133901017.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'CMCSA.US', 'DIS.US', 'FOX.US', 'FOXA.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSGN.US', 'MSGS.US', 'SSP.US', 'UVXY.US']","['COLIN KAEPERNICK', 'NFL', 'THE NFL']","{'polarity': 0.988, 'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.083}"

Portfolio Strength: A Key Catalyst

We believe AWS’ focus on enhancing service offerings is likely to drive momentum across customers.

AWS recently announced a new managed security service — AWS Network Firewall. The new service is well equipped to provide protection against common network threats such as intrusion prevention and detection, dynamic packet filtering, as well as web filtering.

The company also launched the preview of Amazon Braket, which is a fully-managed quantum computing service that enables customers to explore and experiment with quantum computing hardware.

Additionally, it announced a service called Amazon Managed (Apache) Cassandra Service. Further, the company made the new Amazon EC2 capability — namely AWS Nitro Enclaves — generally available. AWS Nitro Enclaves offers a trusted, highly isolated and hardened environment for processing highly sensitive data.

408,2020-11-25T10:32:28+00:00,‘Big Brother’ Amazon Targeted in Retail Fight With Ambani,"(Bloomberg) -- A battle between Amazon.com Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. to dominate India’s $1 trillion consumer market is stoking nationalist rhetoric in a courtroom and outside, as the two companies tussle over the future of a distressed local retailer.

At the center of the case is Amazon’s efforts to block Reliance’s planned purchase of Future Group’s assets, saying the Indian retailer violated a contract by agreeing to a sale to a rival controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani. The Delhi High Court is now weighing if the U.S. e-commerce giant has any legal basis to object to the transaction and a ruling is expected in weeks.

The legal spat has not only revealed the intensity of the fight between two of the world’s richest men -- Jeff Bezos and Ambani -- but has also sparked a “foreign versus local” debate. A lawyer for Future, in his argument, painted Amazon as the “Big Brother in America” out to crush a small local company, while a retailer lobby group declared its “support to Indian company Future Group in its fight against Foreign Amazon.”

For its part, Amazon wants Indian courts and regulators to enforce a business contract in what it views as a commercial dispute. If Future is allowed to renege on its contract with Amazon, it may signal to global investors that investments in India are risky, the U.S. company alleges. That is an inconvenient image at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs foreign investment to create jobs and reboot an economy pummeled by the pandemic.

The stakes are high for both Amazon and Reliance. Securing Future’s assets will give Reliance, already India’s biggest retailer, an unparalleled edge in a market where most of the consumers still prefer shopping in stores. That’s an advantage Amazon is not willing to cede. Nor is Amazon willing to be upstaged by nationalistic arguments after losing ground to home-grown rivals in China. India, with its billion-plus consumers, is effectively the last big growth frontier.

Story continues

”It’s not a surprise that this fight’s taken an India versus foreigner turn. That talks to the broader sentiment Make in India, Buy Indian that prevails,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based advisory, Greyhound Research. “Amazon has put billions in India and it’s fair to expect they’ll do everything to protect their investment.”

Ambani, 63, has been playing the nationalist card as well. The tycoon, who’s been warning against data colonization since 2018, often presents Reliance as a homegrown champion and its telecommunications, retail and digital ventures as nation-building initiatives.

Vocal for Local

This week, Reliance Retail introduced the “Indie” and “Swadesh” -- meaning from one’s own country -- taglines on its e-commerce websites to promote indigenous handicrafts and textiles, dovetailing with Modi’s call to be “Vocal for Local.” In a key May speech, Modi mentioned “self-reliance” at least 17 times during a 33-minute address to the nation.

In August, Reliance announced the $3.4 billion purchase of the indebted Future Group that was straining under a severe cash crunch triggered by the coronavirus-led slump. Amazon, which holds a 49% stake in an unlisted Future Group entity, objected to this transaction and secured an order from a Singapore arbitration court that temporarily put the asset sale on hold. Future petitioned against this freeze-order in the Delhi High Court.

Supporting Future, the Confederation of All India Traders said in a statement Nov. 20 that Amazon is seeking “illegal control” of the retailer.

East India Co.

Harish Salve, the celebrity lawyer representing listed Future Retail Ltd., told the court that Amazon was behaving “like the East India Company of the 21st century.” Amazon’s stand is “either you do business with me or you shut down,” he said, stressing that an aborted asset sale deal will lead to thousands of job losses and bankruptcy.

The East India Company -- formed by a group of British merchants who arrived in India in the 17th century to trade in spices and ended up colonizing the country for centuries -- has been an unpleasant memory in Indian history. This emotive reference marks the latest Indian versus outsider dispute this year that also saw Google face pushback from Indian startups and over 200 apps from Chinese technology companies being banned following a military clash along the Indo-China border.

“Amazon has no investment in Future Retail,” Salve said in court. “Reliance wants to buy, but I have to ask Big Brother in America?” he said, asking if an overseas firm should be allowed to control an Indian company’s business dealings.

$6.5 Billion

Gopal Subramanium, Amazon’s lawyer and India’s former solicitor general, countered that the American e-tailer was no Big Brother or East India Company and had in fact introduced Future Retail to a prospective investor to ease its distress. Amazon has created thousands of jobs and invested $6.5 billion in India so far, he said.

Reliance’s lawyer has argued that the Singapore arbitration tribunal’s emergency order halting the transaction isn’t recognized by Indian law and the deal is crucial to save the retailer from collapse.

These arguments in court were prompted by a Future Group legal petition after Amazon had written to India’s market and antitrust regulators apprising them of the Singapore arbitration order of an interim stay.

Amazon suffered its first setback in the case last week, when the antitrust regulator, Competition Commission of India, approved the Reliance-Future deal. Earlier, Reliance said it intends to complete the transaction “without any delay.”

410,2020-11-25T06:30:00+00:00,South Korea Unveils AI Chip to Maintain Semiconductor Leadership,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea is adding a new artificial intelligence chip to its arsenal of semiconductors as the nation seeks a bigger slice of the global tech market and an upgrade of its industrial capabilities.

The Sapeon X220, unveiled Wednesday by the largest local carrier SK Telecom Co., is designed to speed up servers that cater to a growing number of mobile devices -- from drones to self-driving vehicles -- that perform better with AI. It’s the latest product of the nation’s decade-long push to broaden its dominance beyond memory chips, where Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. control roughly two-thirds of the global market.

South Korea sees data-processing chips as a major engine for future economic growth, along with fifth-generation wireless networks. The government has provided more than 600 billion won ($542 million) in support to develop such chips and plans to invest another trillion won over the next decade, viewing them as crucial in automating factories and improving the competitiveness of the country’s exports.

“As we teamed up with the government, we said, ‘Let’s make AI available and affordable for all of our companies,’” said Lee Jong-min, an SK Telecom vice president overseeing the chip development. “South Korea has the demand, the full stack of tech needed to meet the demand, and the ability to take it to the next level.”

Semiconductors account for about one-fifth of South Korea’s exports, most of them memory chips. The country is now turning to application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, such as the X220, which is tailored for AI operations. It follows a similar $1 billion investment plan announced by the U.S. government this summer, which also emphasized AI and public-private collaboration.

As the first country in the world to roll out commercial 5G last year, South Korea believes it also can lead in adopting and optimizing AI by virtue of the nation’s compact size, wide broadband coverage and smartphone penetration.

Story continues

Competition is heating up in the AI semiconductor space, with the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google investing in their own bespoke server silicon. As more devices than ever come online, companies are betting they can unlock value and insights from the resulting trove of data through machine learning and analysis at scale.

Like SK Telecom, U.S. competitors offer such cloud services to other companies, and the investment in designing the chips makes sense when factoring in the cost of electricity and the chips’ ability to handle greater volumes of data more efficiently.

SK Telecom’s chip, the size of a postage stamp, is the first Korean ASIC for data centers to be commercialized, according to the company. It represents the latest push by the Seoul-based carrier to expand beyond its traditional mobile and broadband businesses and keep up in an era of AI-driven innovation.

The global AI chip market is currently led by Nvidia Corp., a graphics-card giant whose market value has eclipsed that of Intel Corp., the company historically most associated with semiconductor breakthroughs. Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs has spiked in recent years, as the perennially increasing demands of high-resolution video games have been joined by a boom in cryptocurrency mining and other data-intensive applications that benefit from massively parallel processing. Even smartphone processors from the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. now come with dedicated cores for handling AI tasks, and the need for more ASICs like the Sapeon X220 is forecast to rise as artificial intelligence gains more ground in global technology.

411,2020-11-24T21:27:09+00:00,Dell Reports Revenue That Tops Estimates on Robust PC Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts’ estimates, in a sign of robust demand for the company’s personal computers during the pandemic-fueled work-from-home period.

Sales climbed 2.8% to $23.5 billion in the period that ended Oct. 30, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $21.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $2.03 a share compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.42.

Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell has sought to modernize his namesake company by moving to a subscription-based business model. Dell Technologies is letting clients pay for software and hardware as they go rather than upfront, which will generate more predictable, recurring revenue. The company formed a pact with FedEx Corp. and Switch Inc. earlier this month to develop a U.S.-based private cloud network hosted in FexEx facilities, giving customers an alternative to corporate server farms and public cloud services from Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp.

“We met unprecedented demand for remote work and learn solutions,” Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement.

Dell shares gained 3% in extended trading after closing at $70.33 in New York. The stock has increased 37% this year.

Revenue from consumer PCs jumped 14% to $3.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter, the company said. PC sales to business and government clients increased 5.4% to $8.78 billion.

Server and networking sales fell 1.8% to $4.16 billion, while storage hardware revenue declined 7% to $3.86 billion.

Sales from VMware Inc., a software maker majority-owned by Dell, rose 8% to $2.89 billion. The publicly traded company offers software for data centers as well as programs that let employees access their corporate systems to work remotely. Dell is considering plans to spin off VMware, but won’t make a decision until after September 2021.

412,2020-11-24T19:38:01+00:00,BNP Paribas Looks To Transform Finance With Tech: 'A Place For Open Innovation',"Innovation and growth in fintech erupted during the coronavirus pandemic.

That’s according to Matthieu Soulé, the head of BNP Paribas S.A.’s (OTCQX: BNPQY) Silicon Valley-based Innovation Lab, a space to foster innovation and reshape financial services.

Over his career working in digital transformations and innovation strategy, the Audencia Business School alumnus led BNP’s foray into new business models that address finance needs in the changing spaces of mobility, luxury, energy and retail, among others.

In a discussion on BNP’s work around new technologies like blockchain, Soulé said the European financial institution is keen on staying relevant with advancements in payments and peer-to-peer lending, for example.

“My day-to-day is to dissect and analyze new fintechs, insurtechs and technologies that are relevant for so many things today,” he said in reference to cultivating relationships through startups and accelerators.

“We’re accelerating the matchmaking between the new players in the market.”

Crisis Spurs Innovation At BNP: The pandemic drew more attention to technologies that increase access and transparency to financial services and products.

In a discussion on shifts in consumer preferences, Soulé said BNP's innovation labs are a method of ramping up innovation around tech enablers like big data, AI, automation and robots for banking.

“BNP was one of the first to have this kind of innovation in the Bay Area, looking at how these new technologies are impacting the financial services world,” Soulé said.

“It’s a place for open innovation, basically identifying what’s coming up on the market — the opportunities and threats — and trying to create the right connections, at the right time, for the bank.”

Soulé credits such launches as BNP’s Investment Insights service, which allows users voice-activated market commentary and thought leadership through Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa devices, to the research and development at the innovation centers.

Soulé On Sustainable Banking: More recently, BNP has seen increased interest in sustainable finance, he said.

“BNP is pushing technology and climate change,” the BNP exec said. “We’re pretty committed to being the leading bank in the sustainability and climate change effort.”

The efforts have proved successful, he said: BNP created banking and investing tech that increases awareness around clients’ carbon footprint.

“Our initiative was announced and launched in July 2020,” he said in a statement on BNP subsidiary Bank of the West’s partnership with 1% for the Planet, to launch checking accounts designed for climate action.

As part of the development, Bank of the West will donate 1% of net revenues generated from accounts to support nonprofits focused on creating a healthy planet.

The offer will also enable users — from consumers to businesses — access to carbon footprint analytics based on their financial services activity, or spend.

“If you’re going to a gas station, it will tell you what your impact is on the planet,” he said. “We’re looking to evangelize, or create awareness for clients around their carbon footprint.”

Platform For Growth: Given BNP’s size, Soulé said the organization has the potential to inflict serious change in finance.

“BNP is pretty large on the retail and commercial banking side,” Soulé said on the firm’s work with digital-focused initiatives and startups. “We are banking somewhere between 35%-40% of the startups in France.”

Going forward, he said the organization will leverage a culture infused with free-spirited creativity and established principles to disrupt finance.

“The idea is to create an impact based on financial services, and have that transition to have a better impact on the world,” Soulé said on his work with early and late-stage startups.

“What is the future of financial services? Financial instruments are a means to an end, just the way to do it. Banks could be instrumental to the nation, to make an impact.”

413,2020-11-24T07:19:29+00:00,We're Better Off Without the Black Friday Frenzy,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Christmas lights are on, but few are coming to see them.

That was the scene last week on Oxford Street, London’s leading retail thoroughfare, as non-essential shops in England remained closed. It’s hardly the run-up to Black Friday that retailers had hoped for.

I’ve argued before that Europe is better off without the imported annual shopping frenzy. While door-busting deals are a post-Thanksgiving tradition in the U.S., there is no place for them on this side of the Atlantic. Discounts at the busiest time of the year just squander profit. European retailers should take 2020 as a sign to finally ditch the gimmick.

U.K. Black Friday sales are expected to fall 20% from 2019 to 6.2 billion pounds ($8.3 billion), according to PwC, as a combination of shuttered shops, stretched delivery networks, lockdown-weary consumers and stock shortages take their toll.

Although shoppers in continental Europe have been more excited about the shopping holiday over the past couple of years, sales there could also be more subdued. In France, amid an outcry from small stores, big retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and the French department store Galeries Lafayette agreed to postpone their promotions until December 4, when other non-essential retailers are widely expected to be open again.

Black Friday started to appear in Europe around a decade ago, as local retailers sought to compete with Amazon. But over the past few years, British chains such as Next Plc, Marks & Spencer Group Plc and Walmart Inc.’s Asda have weaned themselves off the late-November discounting. Now there is some evidence that others are following suit.

According to PwC, some 65%-70% of online retailers in the U.K., led by those in the fashion industry, were advertising promotions over the past weekend, compared with the 88% that offered discounts for Black Friday in 2019.

Although markdowns could ramp up over the next few days, there are good reasons for retailers to show restraint.

Story continues

With the closure of non-essential shops, sales will come almost exclusively from the web. The rapid increase in online ordering has already put enormous strain on the warehouses that fulfill orders and the couriers who deliver them. Retailers will be reluctant to put anything but full-priced stock through the distribution network.

Meanwhile, shuttered stores and fear of not getting gifts in time for Christmas prompted some consumers to do their holiday shopping early. That means that by the time they get to the end of this week, many may well have run out of steam.

Retail chains are also suffering from some supply problems. Because of the first pandemic lockdown, they placed holiday orders later than usual. In the U.K., these shipments are only now arriving and they’re colliding with Brexit stockpiles, creating chaos at the major port of Felixstowe. Consequently, some products, such as large electrical appliances manufactured in Europe and toys such as jigsaw puzzles, games and craft kits, are in short supply.

U.K. toy retailer The Entertainer is still offering its prearranged level of Black Friday deals, which began last Monday, but it has already had to substitute some products it planned to promote because the items were not available.

One area where bargains might still be found is fashion, given that November is the key month for buying Christmas outfits. Demand for items like sequined party dresses has evaporated, which will likely force retailers to mark down their inventories. But even here surplus stocks may not be too big an issue. Clothing retailers were placing smaller orders for coats and cashmere sweaters in March and April, as they took a cautious view about winter buying. Given recent lockdowns, their pessimism turned out to be wise.

Then there is the possibility of a surge in demand, similar to what happened over the summer, if non-essential stores manage to reopen before Christmas. In this case, sales won’t be needed to bring in those customers who didn’t shop early.

That’s yet another reason for European retailers to consign Black Friday to the bargain bin of history once and for all.

415,2020-11-23T12:00:00+00:00,Foxconn Plant Championed by Trump Lands Google Server Contract,"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group plans to assemble key components for Google servers from its plant in Wisconsin, people familiar with the matter said, finally breathing life into a factory Donald Trump hailed as crucial to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

The Taiwanese company has decided to locate production for this new contract at the existing complex rather than make the components at home or in China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive move. The under-utilized factory should start mass production in the first quarter, timed with the release of Intel Corp.’s Ice Lake server chips, they said. Foxconn is setting up surface-mount technology assembly lines that it will use to place semiconductors onto circuit boards, they added.

Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is one of several Taiwanese firms exploring ways to expand in America and lessen a reliance on Chinese production bases. The company has also sought to diversify a business that counts on Apple Inc. for half its revenue, including by courting more American clients. On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. won city-level incentives for a $12 billion chip plant in Phoenix, another step toward bringing high-tech manufacture back to the U.S. and addressing security concerns over the industry’s supply chain.

A Foxconn representative confirmed it’s developing data center infrastructure and high-performance computing “capabilities” in Wisconsin, but declined to name any customers.

Taiwan counts Washington as an essential diplomatic, economic and military ally amid rising tensions with Beijing. Foxconn, which operates most of its factories in central and southern China, won Google’s business because it was the only contract manufacturer capable of establishing a surface-mount technology line on American soil, one of the people said. Shanghai-listed Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., its cloud business unit, will oversee the server business in Wisconsin, another person familiar with Foxconn’s operations said.

Story continues

The plant in Wisconsin was unveiled to much fanfare in 2018 by Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou and Trump, who called it “the Eighth Wonder of the World.” Once envisioned as the centerpiece of a Made in America effort that would create 13,000 jobs for the Badger State, it instead succumbed to delays and switched directions several times after local officials slashed subsidies. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with just 178 full-time employees. And rather than the promised large-sized display panels, it began churning out face masks and ventilators this year.

Yet its location in the heart of America is now a boon to Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is trying to win lucrative contracts for its server-dependent cloud business. The U.S. company considers it an important area for the company’s growth, but one in which Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. dominate. An American base could help Foxconn court U.S. government contracts, particularly as Washington ramps up scrutiny over a largely Chinese-focused global electronics supply chain.

417,2020-11-23T08:47:13+00:00,Wall Street Analysts Say These 5 Stocks Are A Buy As The World Prepares For The Post-COVID-19 Era,"From escalating tensions between the U.S. and China, the highly infectious coronavirus pandemic outbreak, and the 2020 presidential Election, this year has turned into a rollercoaster ride for investors. Forced lockdowns weighed down industries like the oil & gas sector, retail businesses, theatre, and entertainment companies, but spurred an uptick in technology stocks.

With Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA) reporting high efficacy for their COVID-19 vaccines but the number of new virus cases getting reported remaining high, the analysts are expecting a change in market behavior as the world moves to what they describe as a post-COVID-19 world.

CNBC compiled a list of five stocks with an upside potential based on opinions from leading Wall Steet analysts. Here’s a peek into these stocks and the key factors influencing the analyst forecasts.

Amazon: The pandemic might have shrunk the global economy, however, Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) rose to cross the $1.5 trillion market cap. The e-commerce company’s stock peaked at a 52-week high price of $3,552.25 in early September.

Amazon stock grew approximately 63% on a year-to-date basis and close to 91% since March when the signs of a pandemic became evident.

Last week, Needham analyst Laura Martin rated Amazon as a buy — setting a price target of $3,700, according to TipRanks. Based on Martin’s survey results of a select number of Amazon customers, CNBC reported that 80% of the survey participants would stick to their online shopping trends even during the post-pandemic era.

In the Q3 earnings release in October, Amazon reported $96.1 billion in revenue at a 37% growth rate year-over-year. Amazon last quoted $3,099.40, 0.57% lower, on Friday.

Bentley Systems: RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg revised software company Bentley SystemsInc (NASDAQ: BSY) as a “Buy” stock last week, with a price target of $43, CNBC reports. “Overall, we think a vaccine could benefit Bentley, and a Biden presidency could boost U.S. infrastructure spending,” Hedberg commented.

Story continues

The forecasts were based on the company’s earnings beat in its first release since the trading debut in September. In Q3, Bentley’s $203 million quarterly revenues recorded a growth rate of 8.8% YoY with an 11% YoY growth in recurring revenues for the trailing 12-month period.

The company, on Nov. 12, announced plans to issue 10 million shares at $32 per share and use the proceeds to pay off the outstanding balances of credit facilities. From $25.18 on Sept. 22, the stock has gained 41% and was last seen trading at $35.55, 1.22% higher.

PDF Solutions: San Jose-based software and engineering services company PDF Solutions Inc (NASDAQ: PDFS) received a Buy rating from the Northland Capital analyst Gus Richard after the news of the $35 million Cimetrix acquisition broke out, as per the CNBC report. Richard raised the stock’s price target to $30, last seen quoting $21.28.

Richard says that “PDFS/ Cimetrix together can allow equipment suppliers to collect operational data from equipment and use PDFS big data analytics platform and AI to analyze equipment operational, performance, and process control data”, as reported by CNBC.

Accounting for the acquisition impact in the post-pandemic economy, Richard also anticipates that CY21 earnings could gain between $0.02 and $0.04 per share.

Cytokinetics: At the end of Friday’s trading session, Cytokinetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYTK) was trading at $15.99, 0.95% higher. H.C. Wainright & Co analyst Joseph Pantginis predicts that the biopharma company’s stock holds a 180% upside potential, with an estimated price target of $43.

The analyst’s forecasts are pinned on the success of omecamtiv mecarbil, the company’s treatment for heart failures.

“While a deeper analysis is yet to be conducted and more details are needed to clarify omecamtiv’s real opportunity in HF, we believe these findings suggest a possible path forward for omecamtiv’s approval based on its applicability for the treatment of a defined, significant, population,"" Pantginis said, as per CNBC.

Yelp: Yelp Inc (NYSE: YELP), the San-Francisco headquartered online review company, has lost around 7% year-to-date. But, since March 18, when the lockdown measures began to kick in, the stock has rallied upwards by 123%.

RBC Capital analyst Shweta Khajuria's analysis of the stock’s performance is based on the economic revival in the post-pandemic era. Linking the vaccine availability and distribution with the economic revival, the RBC Capital Analyst opines that shopping centers, restaurants and bars, and other retail outlets would witness an increase in footfalls.

“Management expects Yelp to drive greater benefits from the improvement in its value proposition to advertisers, both perceived and actual to take a greater share of Advertiser budgets,” CNBC quoted Khajuria as saying.

On Friday's close, Yelp had a market cap close to $2.4 billion and was trading at $32.22, 1.19% higher.

Video Transcript

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I just got on Instagram I think a year ago. My communication and that platform for me to share parts of myself out with have already been good for me valuably because I have a direct line of communication, and it's not through someone else's filter. It's a direct line.

At the same time, it's been good for my business, you know. People check now. I didn't know this until I got on IG. Before you do certain jobs, they go-- let me check how many followers you have. Those followers matter even for business, for advertisers and things like that.

What the scary part is that we have to really watch is for the first time in our lives we, especially children and millennials, are getting their entire sense of self based on something they put-- a picture or a phrase, something that they, poof, send out to the world. And they anxiously wait to see what all these strangers are going to say about it. And if the thumbs come back up, I'm going to have a great day. Look at me. I'm popular. If the thumbs come back down, I drop into a depression.

Well, that's not healthy. And where's the responsibility lie? I mean, one, it lies with us parents of our children to say, hey, make sure you're not getting all-- your sense of wealth and identity and significance based on just approval or disapproval of the rest of the world because understand that there's a lot of folks out there that are putting the thumb down or writing something negative, and they didn't even read or look at what you wrote, all right?

So where-- again, where are we allotting value and where are we allotting what our kids do? I always say this. Kiddos, millennials, all of us, thing you type in there, that comment, what you say, it's going to outlive you. It's going to outlive all of us, so think about it before you press Send and before you write it.

Story continues

And also this-- it's short money-- short money you think that to put you down raises me up. It doesn't.

ANDY SERWER: We can come together as a country again, Matthew?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I know we can, but we're not going to-- here's what I think we have to also watch. We're not going to become a kumbaya. There's not going to be perfect justice across society. We're not going to have a utopia. And I think that it's irrational to think that we are. I think it's actually arrogant sometimes to think that this species-- and you look at-- we could go into the nominations, who voted what and where. We are evolving, but we're never going to be our best. We're not going to get there, and I think that's the point. If we could just do a little bit better, have a small ascension to the quality of our lives and who we are and how we treat ourselves and others in it, then there's a small ascension in our life and in society and in America.

America is an aspiration, constantly chasing yet. But we've got to realize, we ain't ever going to get to yet, but that's the point. Trying to get a little bit better is as good as it gets.

Shares of the department store fell as much as 5% in early trading as Macy’s said third quarter same-store sales crashed 20.2%. While the company touted a return to adjusted operating profits ($159 million) and a pop in e-commerce sales (up 27%), investors keyed in on two worrying items ahead of the crucial holiday shopping period.

First, Macy’s told the Street gross profit margins likely “peaked” for 2020 in the third quarter.

Considering Macy’s has fired thousands of people and closed a great deal of stores over the past 24-months in a major cost-cutting exercise, the Street was likely expecting more leverage on the profit margin line even on depressed sales levels. No go on that one for Macy’s, or so it appears, amidst what will be an ultra competitive holiday season that could require higher than planned discounting for the retailer.

Meanwhile, Macy’s same-store sales decline of 20.2% masked severe weakness at the store level.

In a slide-deck posted on its investor relations page, Macy’s noted store sales plunged 36%. Keep in mind this comes as Macy’s stores reopened for business after quarantine-related closures earlier in the year. The weak store sales in the third quarter suggests Macy’s may have problems reaching its expected goal of improved sequential adjusted operating profits in the fourth quarter as consumers stay away from stores as COVID-19 infections rise again.

All bets could be off for Macy’s on even sniffing its fourth quarter operating profit expectations if states reimpose restrictions to combat the resurgent coronavirus. Given recent developments out of some states on the lockdown front, fresh retail store closures must not be ruled out. And Mr. Market looks to be sniffing that out right now as it pertains to Macy’s.

“The outlook for holiday is depressed, and we don't see how this company or the entire department store industry can ever recover from the share losses to discount/off-price and other e-commerce players. Bottom line ... Macy's is in a tough spot,” wrote Jefferies analyst Randal Konik after Macy’s flubbed quarter.

Konik added, “Secular headwinds are real, which we expect will accelerate as a result of COVID (e.g. more e-commerce stickiness). While cost savings initiatives are helpful, we believe shares will lack material upside until M's store fleet sees further rationalization, comps re-inflect, and margins recover.”

The analyst prefers shares of off-price retailer TJX Companies, as the TJ Maxx and Marshall’s owner benefits from consumers trading down to save money during the pandemic.

Perhaps the one upshot for Macy’s: It’s not nearing a cash crunch after months of working to improve liquidity levels. The company ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and $3 billion of untapped capacity in its asset-based credit facility.

421,2020-11-19T13:00:28+00:00,The AgTech Revolution is Underway in Appalachia with AppHarvest,"AppHarvest is going public via a merger with Novus Capital Corp.

AppHarvest is an AgTech company that grows chemical pesticide-free produce including tomatoes in palatial greenhouses Novus Capital Corp. trades at an implied 2.9 times 2024 sales, just ½ the multiple of Beyond Meat, Inc. Revenue forecast to rise 10x between 2021 and 2024 with sales effectively locked in due to enormous demand Potential to market tomatoes and other produce at a premium price point over time Investors include Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, Inclusive Capital, and Novus Capital Corp. Board members include Martha Stewart, Narya Capital Co-Founder and Partner JD Vance, Impossible Foods Chief Financial Officer David Lee, impact investor Jeff Ubben Shareholders include Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Inclusive Capital Partners, Equilibrium, Narya Capital, Lupa Systems, Breyer Capital, Endeavor Catalyst

By Jarrett Banks

Investors looking for a certified B Corp. couldn’t do better than AgTech startup AppHarvest, which combines more than purpose and profit: It is reviving an entire region whose residents desperately want it there.

AppHarvest’s Kentucky greenhouse is less than a day’s drive from 70% of America’s population, which will reduce fuel and food waste associated with transporting fresh vegetables around the country. The greenhouse grower, which relies on rainwater rather than local water supplies, aims to create jobs in Eastern Kentucky, a region hard hit by the decline of the coal industry.

And with the company going public via a merger with a SPAC called Novus Capital Corp. (Ticker: NOVS), investors have a chance to be a part of the Appalachian food revolution. The combination, which is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2020 or early in the first quarter of 2021, is expected to provide $475 million of gross proceeds to the company, including $375 million from a fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share anchored by existing and new investors – Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, Inclusive Capital, and Novus Capital Corp. Investors who buy NOVS shares now will automatically see them convert to shares of the combined company after the merger closes.

Story continues

The company is one of only 3,600 certified B Corps and will become one of just a dozen publicly traded public benefit corporations. Jonathan Webb, the Founder and CEO of AppHarvest, which will use the ticker APPH when it lists on the Nasdaq, is very outspoken about the need for companies to be “sticky” in the long term. The company aspires to transform American agriculture with large-scale, controlled indoor farms. J.D. Vance, author of national bestseller The Hillbilly Elegy, is on the board of directors.

The company says its farms aim to improve access to non-GMO fruits and vegetables, reduce water usage by 90%, and eliminate agricultural runoff. The company plans to use the $475 million from the transaction to fund more projects in the area.

AppHarvest just announced it has planted its first tomato crop at its high-tech controlled environment agriculture facility in Morehead, Ky. The crop is scheduled to be harvested and available at leading U.S. grocery stores in early 2021. The “Dutch-style” 60-acre facility is one of the world’s biggest high-tech greenhouses (it has strong relationships with companies in the Netherlands, which has the world’s leading high-tech greenhouse industry). The company is also already building a second similar-size facility in nearby Richmond, Ky.

Mr. Webb has been vocal about wanting to replace Mexican produce in U.S. grocery stores. The majority of many vegetable varieties in U.S. grocery stores are shipped from Mexico where they are sprayed with chemical pesticides three to four times a week. They are genetically modified for transportation and don’t have the nutrient density of those organically grown. AppHarvest believes its Appalachian location between the East Coast and the Midwest could be a solution and bring jobs back.

Tomato Plants at the Morehead, Ky Facility

Meanwhile, Covid-19, in addition to pointing out myriad flaws across the healthcare industry, has also exposed vulnerability in supply chains. AppHarvest is betting that supply chain disruptions related to the coronavirus pandemic will push large grocers to back more domestic sources of produce.

Then there is climate change. AppHarvest’s third facility, located in Berea, Ky., will be 15 acres and grow leafy greens. Drought-stricken Arizona and California currently produce 90% of U.S.-grown leafy greens. Central Appalachia has so much rain that the facilities can be operated on 100% recycled rainwater.

The region also has lower utility and property rates along with cheaper labor. At its first facility, AppHarvest received 6,000 applications for 300 job openings. With high unemployment across the region, the company will focus on retraining people who have lost their jobs in other industries.

The company says it wants to get to a volume scale so that it can sell its produce to all Americans, not just people who can pay a premium. By using new technology such as robotics and AI that scans plants to look for signs of infestation, AppHarvest is ushering in a new era in agriculture. It uses bumble bees inside the greenhouses to pollinate the plants and monitors their hives with AI.

Outside View of the Morehead, Ky Facility

A greener and cleaner era will also probably be in line with the election of Joe Biden. The President-elect’s website says he will “create jobs in climate-smart agriculture,” with a focus on hard hit, rural communities.

Beyond government efforts, ESG assets under management reached $1 trillion for the first time in the second quarter, according to Morningstar data. UBS found that 56% of sustainable funds outperformed their peers in the second quarter. Sustainable investors will likely keep the wind at their backs as governments push green stimulus, the Swiss bank’s analysts said.

Setting aside the company’s ESG credentials for a moment, AppHarvest has an enviable core business model. Thanks to extremely high demand for U.S.-grown produce, grocers will likely trip over themselves trying to secure AppHarvest tomatoes. And the company has a distribution deal with one of the two dominant distributors in the U.S. and Canada.

That should give investors comfort in the company’s projection to grow revenue tenfold from $25 million in 2021 to $246 million in 2024. AppHarvest also expects to swing to positive Ebitda reasonably quickly – in 2023 – which should give investors added confidence.

Another possibility that’s not incorporated into the company’s projections is brand power. While the company wants to price its produce at rates that are in reach of all consumers, AppHarvest’s tomatoes could easily become recognizable and command a premium. Amazon.com, Inc.’s Whole Foods, for instance, frequently advertises produce provenance to charge higher prices.

The good news that may surprise some investors: The stock is still cheap. At the SPAC’s closing price of $11.33 Thursday, AppHarvest trades at an implied enterprise value, adjusted for cash, of 2.9 times 2024 sales, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform. That’s roughly half the multiple of Beyond Meat, which trades at 5.7 times and isn’t growing as fast.

And as one of the few B Corp. companies in the public markets, AppHarvest should get an extra boost. Just look at Lemonade, a fintech B Corp. that trades at 7.4 timers 2024 sales – far above peers.

But AppHarvest is more than a feel-good ESG – or even profit – story. The company also embodies the private sector leading the country out of one of the worst crises in American history. Maybe a new JD Vance type author will someday write another bildungsroman about the region. Call it Hillbilly Energy.

422,2020-11-19T11:00:00+00:00,Influencers with Andy Serwer: Matthew McConaughey,"In this episode of Influencers, Andy is joined by Academy Award winning actor and 'Greenlights' author, Matthew McConaughey, as they discuss mental health, money, and the keys to living a happy and successful life.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: A life in the public eye. We've watched as Hollywood icon Matthew McConaughey performed his great transformation, beating the typecast rom-comer to become an Academy Award winning actor and, now, a best-selling author. But if you ask him, McConaughey prefers to call himself a storyteller, proving it with his new memoir, ""Greenlights,"" in which he lays bare the stories and life lessons that have made him the success he is today. McConaughey's reach goes beyond the silver screen. He's invested in startups and soccer, partnered with Wild Turkey and Ford, and he's even taken on a new role as Minister of Culture for Austin, Texas. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I'm joined by Matthew McConaughey, as he shares his thoughts on life, money, and how he paved the way for ""Greenlights"" over the course of his career.

Hello, everyone. Welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Matthew McConaughey, Oscar award-winning actor and best-selling author of ""Greenlights,"" a really cool new book. Matthew, great to see you.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Good to see you, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So I read the book and loved it. It's just very different, you know? I mean there's a lot of actors who write memoirs and books about themselves. But this was sort of a different way of exploring your own self as a character. And so I'm wondering, you had Matthew McConaughey, iconoclastic character over here, and the traditional book industry over here. Right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm. Yes.

ANDY SERWER: And then the two of them have to come together.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yes.

ANDY SERWER: And I wonder what that was like. How much did the book industry change your thinking about how you were going to do the book, and how much did you say, no, I want to do it this way?

Story continues

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: 100% the second half. I mean, I went in and was very clear with my publishers and editors that, look, this is what I think the book will be. It's not a Hollywood tell-all. I remember I wrote this down on day two when I went away to write. I said, look, I understand that me, as Matthew McConaughey, have some equity with, I write a book, some people are going to go buy it even if what's on the page isn't worth a damn. Some people are not going to buy it, even if the words on the page are great, because it's Matthew McConaughey. I understand the equity that my name brings into it, and the platform that that inherently brings. But I remember writing, the second day, I was like, look, the words on this page need to be worthy to be in a book and be shared if they are signed by anonymous. And, at the same time, be words that only I could've written. So that was the place where I was going, this is not me going and writing a book of me as a celebrity. This is me writing my book-- And there's some celebrity in it, because I am a celebrity. So, I was saying, it was very clear with them that that's what I was out to write, and I was very clear with them what the book was not going to be. Like, this is not a tell-all book.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: This is not a book of me telling stories out of school that are not my stories to tell. And I'm not going to add anything in there unless I think they can be constructive, for me and, hopefully, others.

ANDY SERWER: So I saw it right here. And I said, well, that's you, right there. And I said, you know, I'm going to pick this thing up and read it. And then I had no idea, ""New York Times"" best seller. Why do you think this book is resonating with so many people, and why is it so popular?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: You know, I learned something in the writing of this, and it had to do with the challenge that I was finding of when do I use the first-person I in the storytelling, the second-person you, and the third-person royal we. Well, you've got to watch it with the we's, because you can come across as arrogant, and platitudinal, and, like, who the hell is he, speaking for all of humanity? You've got to watch it with the you's, because then it sounds like the writer's talking at you, or telling you what to do. And it gives a dislocation between me, the writer, and you, the reader. And what I found is that, if I stuck to the I, just go personal, Matthew. Tell the subjective, how you saw it, how you-- It actually became more relatable to the royal we. So the more personal I got, the more relatable to more people it became. And I noticed that in the writing. I was like, oh, if you just stick with the I, and how it feels to you, then it's going to relate to more people. So I think that's what's happening. I think people are reading it. They're somehow seeing themselves, or circumstances in their lives, that are similar to mine. Seeing where, maybe, they reacted and had a perspective that was similar or different. Seeing me word different tools for with which to approach certain situations that I found gave some satisfaction, that maybe they could use in their life. And I think people are finding it just plain, damn funny.

ANDY SERWER: It is. I was telling people, it's kind of like a ""True Detective,"" you know, like that TV show that you were in. A wild ride. Very much so. Hey, so, in the book, Matthew, at one point, when you were taking a break from rom-coms, and you're just saying, I'm going to sacrifice the here and now for a better later, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yep.

ANDY SERWER: And you said, as Warren Buffett said, and my eyes are like this, because, you know, I'm a business guy. You said, as Warren Buffett says, buying straw hats in the winter. So my question is, how much do you follow Warren Buffett, or know about him? Or do you own Berkshire Hathaway stock?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I don't follow it much. I have a money man landlord who follows it. And I think I had read that quote years ago. But I don't follow it. I don't follow it daily. I do follow, sort of, cultural trends, and try to disseminate how much am I, from the subjective POV of what happens as an entertainer, in the culture of entertainment? And, you know, how much does the entertainment and pop culture lead trends? And how much does it just react to trends? And things like that. And I've always been someone who has kept sort of a docket of my own consumer reports about products. And how much do you want a product? How much do you need a product? How much does a product that any of us put out, whether it's ourselves or one we create, invent, or discover, how much are they in demand? And there has to be a certain amount of demand. And what would be in demand in a time like COVID comes along? What's in demand in a time of a drought? What's in demand in a time of great affluence? So those are the trends that I keep my eye on.

ANDY SERWER: Anything catching your eye right now?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, what we're doing right now is going to remain, to some extent, the new normal. Even if the vaccine, which is coming out soon, so they say, and if that becomes successful and more people get vaccinated, there are millions of people who are going to say, no, thank you. I practiced remotely doing business and having interactions this way. I prefer it. So how does this experience become more exclusive? More intimate? More customized? Because, in many ways, I myself prefer this. Not with everybody. But, in many ways, I have. And then I have to look at my productivity, which I know many companies have looked at their productivity. And, in some of the companies, the productivity has gone up, to see how adaptable their employees can be. So, you know, but then I have to look across even my industry of acting. What's the future of theaters? What's the future of all of these communal events? What's the future of my home city of Austin, which is a big hospitality town? Which means you've got to do it hand to hand. And then, you know, there's a version that I see of the world turning into of go live wherever you want on the planet. As long as you've got 5G, you can be anywhere. We'll see how much that's the new normal. How much now is the future.

ANDY SERWER: Have you talked to people in Hollywood much about how things are going to go from here? Maybe starting up production, or anything like that?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I haven't really. Most my friends are still working, and they're telling me that it's going safely, and then there's all the rules and regulations of how they do it. I've been more conservative with our quarantine. I've got my 88-year-old mother with us. I've got my family, three children and my wife. And I'm also in a privileged position, to where I've saved my money where I don't have to work today to pay my rent tomorrow. So I'm in a privileged position to say I'm going to be more conservative with my quarantine. But I've also noticed that I've been quite productive through this. I've employed my children now to be part of my production team when we're shooting photo shoots and shooting ads. And they're starting to get adept with cameras, and editing, et cetera. So who knows? I may come out of this in a couple of years and go, I'm a one-stop shop. I've got McConaughey kids, my production team. What do you want done? We'll shoot it. We'll make it.

ANDY SERWER: McConaughey family productions.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: That'd be fun.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. Yeah. Hey, so getting back to the book, there was a moment in there where you talked about one of your films that has a strong business slant. And you had a part in that which really resonated with people as well, which is ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm.

ANDY SERWER: And I'm wondering, you know, did that change your thinking about Wall Street? Or did you research the financial services business when you were doing that part? I mean, that was pretty epic, when you just came in and did that soliloquy, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, that character's soliloquy was awesome. I mean, you know, I try to find what's called a launchpad line with every character. Meaning it's a line that you read and you go, oh. If that character means this, then there's an encyclopedia I could write, and I'll make a whole rap on that character. Meaning, like, in ""Dazed and Confused,"" there was a character, Wooderson, I played, where he's hanging out in the pool yard and checking out that high school girls going by. And his buddy says, you've got to cut that out, Wooderson, you're going to end up in jail. And Wooderson goes, no, man, that's what I love about those high school girls, man. I get older and they stay the same age. Well, I remember reading that line and going, well, who the heck is that? There's a book on that guy. If that guy believes that, if he's not saying that as an attitude, or to be cool or anything, if he believes that, there's a book on a person who goes through life believing that. Well, with ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" I remember reading this line where he's telling the Belfort character, that Leonardo played, the secret to this business is cocaine and hookers. And I went--

[LAUGHTER]

I went, who is that? I go, well, if this person really believes that, well, there was a rap. So I just started writing and interviewing different brokers about how it was then. And how, you know, you sort of create a mirage and you just kind of keep it going. And I wrote a lot of that rap. And, luckily, you know I pitched it Scorsese. He was all for it. And went and just laid it down in that scene. It was a wonderful, classic scene, and so much fun to do.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. It was an awesome part of an awesome movie, too.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: Let's switch gears a little bit, Matthew, and I want to talk to you about some brand stuff. Because that's interesting, and it seems to sort of fit with the road that you take, which is sticking to who you are. And, you know, the Lincoln commercials, and your brand ambassadorship with Lincoln, part of Ford, of course, has been very high profile. It's been, you know, Ellen's done it. Jim Carrey. ""South Park."" I mean, it's been all over the place. But it seems to have really worked. And you seem really comfortable in those commercials. And I think Lincoln's comfortable with you. Is that the case?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: We're selling cars. We're selling automobiles. We're selling SUVs. Indeed. I mean, look, Lincoln and I, and the Ford company, have had a great relationship since the beginning. Hudson Rouge, the ad agency, we're still working with the same people there, John Pearce over there. So, myself, Lincoln, Ford, and the ad company, were all very aligned in what we wanted to do. And so we came out with the first ads, and I was coming off of ""True Detective."" And so I riffed on a bunch of those things that I say in the car. And those got parodied, ""Saturday Night Live"" and Ellen. And that's like, OK, great. And some of the parodies were actually very good. Some were better than others. But I don't mind an impersonation of me. Just be really good at it. And some of them did some damn good work. Well, that sort of got attention and eyeballs on it. And we said early on, look, there's so many loud commercials out there. All the ads are, like, who can turn up the volume the most? Well, what if we make such an intentional and deliberate commercial, that's so quiet that it actually cuts through the noise? And I saw it happen. I was in sports bars on Sunday afternoons, with loud males and females screaming over the game. And then the ad would come on, and they'd go-- And their head would turn to the TV to see the ad. So it worked. And we've maintained a very consistent tone. What we've gotten to is where you want to get to, I believe, is where I've become synonymous with Lincoln and Lincoln has become synonymous with me. So we're feeding each other. And we continue. We just made some ads here recently that we're putting out. And the SUVs that are coming out of there are doing well. And it's helped some sales. And they've got a really good product. I'm especially, particularly, fond of that Navigator that I've had, which is a really, really, really good product.

ANDY SERWER: Was there any connection to ""Lincoln Lawyer?"" Or just a coincidence?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Not really. Just, really, a coincidence. I mean, there was a connection. I had driven a Lincoln before, and had one, and owned one, and drove one in my own life. But that was really just a coincidental callback, that I had done ""Lincoln Lawyer"" as well.

ANDY SERWER: Another brand you work with, which has a long, cool commercial. I mean, it's more than a commercial. It's one of these films, mini-films, is Wild Turkey. Which I happen to be a huge fan of. I drive Fords, too, by the way. But I really like Wild Turkey. I have for a very long time. So I watch that with particular interest.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm.

ANDY SERWER: But it was very candid, also. You say, hey, they wanted me to come down and do this. I wanted to do more than just go, hey, buy Wild Turkey, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, once again, I mean, look. For me, it was cool that these were two American companies. You know, Ford Lincoln, American company. Bourbon, in general, is actually an American invention. Then I go to meet the Russell family. You know, I'm at a time in my life where I want to be in business with people that I believe in what they do. Not that they're perfect. But I believe in what they do, that we're both authentic in what we do and why we do it. The Wild Turkey came along after I got to know the Russell family. And they're three generations, and how they haven't changed, when they could have changed to maybe be more popular. But they were set in their ways, and they knew they had a damn good, solid bourbon in 101. And that that, though it may have its fads and be more popular at other times than not, that they were going to stick to it, because that was a quintessential, great bourbon. And after the world and America went through the white spirits time, and wanted to go through bourbon lights, and then came out going, I really want a great, solid bourbon. The Russell family and Campari had plenty of 101 bottles to go, well, here you go. This is exactly what you're looking for. And consumers went, yes, that is what we're looking for. At the same time, I didn't want to be just a face. I talked with them and shared stories. So I became the creative director with them, helping with the ad campaign. Who's our audience we have that we want to keep? Who's the new generation that we have to introduce Wild Turkey to? And then I also co-created my own bourbon, Longbranch, with Eddie Russell. Which was always a dream of mine, to have my own favorite bourbon on the planet, which is what we have in that bottle.

ANDY SERWER: That's a good thing. Hey, let me ask you about some of your investments. And I want to start off with Austin FC, your soccer team. How's that going? And are you guys on track to actually play next year?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: We are on track, and it's going really well. You know, soccer, the game of soccer, the international sport of soccer, I'm betting on that, too. I really think that's a real riser as a game in our future. We have the World Cup coming in a few years. So we're going to be the front porch for the international game of football, right here in North America. Austin, a perfect city for the international game of soccer. A town that's never had a pro team. A town that's only team in town is the University of Texas Longhorns. And now, where Austin used to be a college town, a government town, and a music town, well, it's now a banker town, a dot-com town, lawyer town, and an international destination. There are millions of people in Austin that didn't go to UT. It's a very diverse community, for the most diverse game in the world, soccer. The greatest invitation in the world, as I call it, the soccer ball. We now have soccer coming to Austin. Now what we're looking forward to do is how are we going to bring Austin to soccer?

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. That's going to be fun to watch.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: And shaping the experience in our backyard, at our stadium. Which, you know, the grass got put in last week on the pitch. And something about just seeing real grass being put in that stadium made it all feel a whole lot more real. And, yes, as of right now, we are still on track to kick off next season.

ANDY SERWER: You've seen that show ""Ted Lasso?"" You could get him to be your coach.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I've seen the ads. I haven't the show.

ANDY SERWER: Check it out. It's funny. Speaking of sports, Matthew, you also have a stake in ""The Athletic,"" I believe, which is a digital sports media business. Media business can be kind of tough. How's that going? Did you invest in that with Peter Thiel? Did you get a chance to meet with him? How's that going?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yes. It's going well. And I did invest in it. And, look, I like sports enough to really appreciate an A-plus perspective on sports. I don't mind the B-minus, sort of the everyman, the sort of half-sports fan knowledge. But I like A-plus sports knowledge. But I don't really like it all in straight metrics. I like a good story told. And they have really great writers over there. And I'm a storyteller. They tell a good story. They're not out to get the athlete. They're in to talk about the story, and the athletics, and all the different mechanisms that go into sports, from the business side, to the personal side, to the players' rights side, to the love of the game. They cover all of those. And so, once again, this was another product that I go, I partake of this product. I drive a Lincoln. I drink Wild Turkey. I like soccer. I like great sportswriting. Oh, I'd love to-- It's more authentic if I can get into something that, on my proverbial Monday morning desk, when I have work to do or to go over something, I look forward to that work. So all of these entities you're talking about and my investments are things that I look forward to dealing with on my proverbial Monday morning at my office desk.

ANDY SERWER: Did you get a chance to meet with Peter Thiel and talk to him about it? I mentioned him.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yes. And when did we talk? We hadn't talked in person. Because this all happened, I believe, since COVID.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. That's what I read, right? So you guys chatted about it a little bit?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah. About the things I just told you.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: The last investment I want to ask you about, that I know about, is something that really interested me, this Forward company, which is a high-tech, membership-only health facility. And, of course, everyone says, wow, it's just like ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" because it's a monthly membership. But it is a monthly membership. And, again, I guess that's just a coincidence too. I mean, is there any connection between that?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: No, there's no real connection between that. That was brought to me as an opportunity from a friend of mine who's an investment, Guy Oseary. And the concept of-- And this was years ago, I invested in this. That people would be able to, sort of, self-maintain their health and communicate with their doctor remotely. It was something where I was like, that sounds evolutionary. That sounds like that could be more than a convenience. That could be a need. That could be more than just a luxury. That could be something that could be good for a lot of people who are not as privileged as others, to have that capacity, an immediate response with their doctor through a remote device. So that just sounded to me as a really good idea for the future.

ANDY SERWER: And my understanding is you've got other investors, like Ashton Kutcher, Bono, and The Edge. Have you met with them and talked to them about it at all?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: No. No. I haven't talked to them really about it. Just mainly Guy and Ashton.

ANDY SERWER: OK. Yeah, I think the CEO and founder was a guy who was running artificial intelligence at Google. Sounds like kind of a brainiac.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Adrian. Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: Impressive sounding guy. Any other investments that I'm missing here that you want to share with us?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: The only other investment is a category that I'm creating now, which is Minister of Culture role.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Talk about that.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I'm working with the University of Texas at Austin and in the city of Austin. I'm working on a shared and competent values campaign that will sell a city to itself. The best assets of the city. In my particular case, the Petri dish will be Austin. Sell Austin to Austinites. Let newcomers know. You know, educate them and initiate them to who we are and who we're not. I think values are what need to be shared right now, not only across cities and universities, but also across businesses. We're, you know, taking the B Corp model of purpose, and people, and profit. That there's a tithe to pay for a great city that we live in like Austin. And we need to be giving back to it, because we want to preserve what we love about it so much. And I also believe values are what's going to bind the social contracts between people again. Especially now, at a time of such great distrust that we have in each other. Where we don't know what our leaders are about. We don't know who to believe in. We've got to bind the social contracts with each other again. And we can do that, personally, across cities, across institutions, and across businesses.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. Amen to that. I mean, I was going to ask, and I'll follow up a little bit. I mean, if you think about Austin, and, say, Armadillo World Headquarters, right? And going back to those days, where, famously, you know, the hippies would sit with the cowboys. That was sort of the whole part of that cultural thing going on there. And we really lost that in this country. And, you know, you're someone who I see can really bridge that divide. But I want to ask you, you know, a lot of people point fingers at income and wealth inequality, number one. And then, number two, social media.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm.

ANDY SERWER: And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on both of those, Matthew.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, so the first one, your question is my thoughts on income and--

ANDY SERWER: Wealth inequality. The wealth gaps in this country.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah. Well, you know, it sure seems like, a lot of times, when we break down the differences between us, by our sex, or color of skin, or what have you, boy, the real place that everything sort of finds its waterline is in our socioeconomic level. You know, especially in America, the capitalist society. Money's still king, you know? You need it to get what you want. It's what America tells our children and ourselves what to be successful is. Money and fame. I think, you know, we need to not necessarily have those always at the top. And, also, I think, what I mean by that is I'm all for making money. I have good money. I'm all for fame. I'm happy to be famous. But I'm inspired by looking at people like a John Mackey with Wholes Foods, or a Marc Benioff with Salesforce, that go, hey, I have an idea that's really good to do even if it was for nonprofit. But let's make profit off of it. So what are those things that we can ask ourselves, hey, no, I want to sell this? I want to make this. I want to make money off this. I want to get rich off this. And how can it also be, can we parlay that to be in something like, oh, and it's good for the most amount of people? Those two are interchangeable. And they don't have to be a contradiction. And I hope that more of us invest in those kind of things. Because you can make a really good living, a for profit living, with a nonprofit idea. And your second question was social media?

ANDY SERWER: Social media. Yeah. What's your take on that these days?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I think it's a great tool. And, look, I just got on Instagram, I think, a year ago. My communication, and that platform for me to share parts of myself out with, have already been good for me, valuably, because I have a direct line of communication. And it's not through someone else's filter. It's a direct line. At the same time, it's been good for my business, you know? People check now. I didn't know this until I got on IG. Before you do certain jobs, they go, let me check how many followers you have. Those followers matter, even for business. For advertisers and things like that. What the scary part is, that we have to really watch, is, for the first time in our lives, we, especially children and millennials, are getting their entire sense of self based on something they put. A picture, a phrase, something that they, poof, send out to the world. And they anxiously wait to see what all these strangers are going to say about it. And if the thumbs come back up, I'm going to have a great day. Look at me. I'm popular. If the thumbs come back down, I drop into a depression. Well, that's not healthy. And where does the responsibility lie? I mean, one, it lies with us parents of our children. Say, hey, make sure you're not getting your sense of wealth, and identity, and significance based on just approval or disapproval of the rest of the world. Because understand that there's a lot of folks out there, that are putting the thumb down or writing something negative, and they didn't even read or look at what you wrote. All right? So, again, where are we allotting value, and where are we allotting what our kids? I always say this. Kiddos, millennials, all of us, that thing you type in there, that comment, what you say, it's going to outlive you. It's going to outlive all of us. So think about it before you press send, and before you write it. And, also, this. It's short money, short money, to think that to put you down raises me up. It doesn't.

ANDY SERWER: So do you think we can come together as a country again, Matthew?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I know we can. But here's what I think we have to also watch. We're not going to become a kumbaya. There's not going to be perfect justice across society. We're not going to have a utopia. And I think that it's irrational to think that we are. I think it's actually arrogant, sometimes, to think that this species-- And we could go into the denominations, who voted what and where. We are evolving. But we're never going to be our best. We're not going to get there. And I think that's the point. If we could just do a little bit better, have a small ascension to the quality of our lives, and who we are, and how we treat ourselves and others in it, then there's a small ascension in our life, and in society, and in America. America is an aspiration. Constantly chasing, yet. But we've got to realize, we ain't ever going to get to yet. But that's the point. Trying to get a little bit better is as good as it gets. So join the party in trying to be a little bit better and chasing yet.

ANDY SERWER: The last question, and the only place to go from there, has got to be UT football. And I'm just wondering, you know, is that back? Are you on board? How's the team looking? The schedule. All that.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, I'm on board. I'm always on board. No matter what state we're in, or what our record is, I'm on board. You know? I'm not a coattail chaser, by any means. I'm a Longhorn fan. No matter if we just got beat 46 to 3, there we go, by UCLA 10 years ago, or whether we just won the Big 12 or the National Championship. So I'm on board. Are where we want to be? Not yet. But we're on our way. You come to UT, you are expected to compete for national championships in that sport, especially football, which is our front porch. We're not doing that right now. I do believe we're on our way, yes. We have some great athletes. You know, you've got this, you know, new challenge today with one of the things we were just talking about, social media. And the 18 to 22-year-old student playing in the proverbial third person, you know, running down the sideline, looking at the jumbotron, how do I look? Well, we do that. You know, taking the selfie while you're still on the 50, running for the touchdown. Because, immediately, you're getting a response on your game and you're finding out how people feel about it. And you're getting objective of your situation. Hopping out of yourself, looked at yourself. Texas football is really going to help us get to the heights we need to, in this time, to forget about that. We have that spotlight on us. We'll find that out. Again, I said this the other day in an interview, play every single play, every single quarter, every half, every game. And, when the fourth quarter is over, be running down to the other end, ready for the fifth quarter because you think it's the fourth, and have the coaches tell you, no, no, no. Game's over. We won. And if you do that, if you're almost that unconscious that the game's even over, if you have your proverbial goal line so far ahead of you, your finish line, you're usually going to look up on the scoreboard and see you win. So it's play more in the first person, be more present, understand that there's no auditions when you come to University of Texas. It's on. It's live. Step up. Let's roll.

ANDY SERWER: All right. We're going to leave it there. Matthew McConaughey, actor and author of ""Greenlights."" Thank you so much for joining us.

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has agreed to sell its 85% stake in Seiyu, a Japanese supermarket chain, to U.S. investment firm KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) and Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten (TSE:4755). The U.S. retailer would retain a 15% stake in Seiyu. The deal is valued at approximately $1.6 billion and the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval.

The combined retail expertise and innovation of KKR, Rakuten and Walmart will help Seiyu's digital transformation.

Looking back

Walmart has struggled to find its footing in a highly competitive Japanese retail sector. Foreign players, including British multinational groceries and general merchandise retailer Tesco and Carrefour, a French international hypermarket chain, have exited the market.

The big-box retailer entered Japan back in 2002, purchasing a 6% stake in Seiyu. Walmart happened to be the first foreign retailer to take control of a Japanese retailer. In 2008, having incurred losses for seven straight years amid stiff competition, the company fully acquired Seiyu.

In 2019, however, Seiyu recorded a net profit of 47 million yen after having reported losses in most of the previous years.

Prior to divesting of its majority stake in Seiyu, Walmart pulled out of Britain and Argentina due to fierce competition from local peers.

Details of the impending deal

Rakuten has had an online venture with Seiyu since 2018.The collaboration enabled Rakuten to deliver goods from Seiyo's stores and logistics centers to consumers' homes. Going forward, the deal will help the e-commerce company more effectively compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which recently collaborated with Life Corp. (TSE:8194), a general retailer of lifestyle-related goods and clothing, in view of stepping up its game in the online grocery business. Rakuten's Group Executive Vice President Kazunori Takeda commented:

Story continues

""We look forward to accelerating digital transformation of Seiyu brick and mortar retail and further merging the best of offline and online retail to offer Seiyu customers the best possible OMO (online merges with offline) customer experience.""

Japan is a high-priority market outside the U.S. for the private equity fund KKR, particularly because the coronavirus pandemic has triggered and accelerated the Japanese businesses' assets disposal and restructuring program. Hiro Hirano, co-jead of Asia Pacific Private Equity and the CEO of Japan at KKR, said:

""We will focus on working closely with Seiyu's management team and associates and leveraging the expertise of Rakuten and Walmart to enhance the customer experience, meet their ever-changing needs, and make shopping more accessible through digitalization.""

As far as Walmart is concerned, it would keep giving Seiyu access to its best global retail practices, sourcing network and scale so as to maintain price leadership.

Summing up

Walmart's near exit from Japan reflect its intension of focusing on China and India, which are high-growth markets, and the U.S. ,most importantly, from where it derives roughly 70% of consolidated revenue.

427,2020-11-16T12:42:40+00:00,Walmart to Sell Most of Japan’s Seiyu to Rakuten and KKR,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart Inc. is selling most of Japanese retailer Seiyu to KKR & Co. and Rakuten Inc. in a deal that values the supermarket chain at 172.5 billion yen ($1.6 billion), as the U.S. giant retreats from its two-decade attempt to crack Japan’s retail market.

Under the agreement, private equity fund KKR will become the majority owner with a 65% stake, while Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten takes 20%, the companies said in a statement Monday. Walmart will retain a 15% minority interest. Rakuten and KKR will seek to shore up Seiyu’s digital operations as demand for online retail grows in Japan amid the pandemic. The new owners are retaining a previously announced plan to re-list Seiyu in the future.

“An IPO is certainly common goal for us,” Eiji Yatagawa, a partner at KKR, told Bloomberg News. “What’s important is to build a business that can go public. For a company to go public, you need to demonstrate a very attractive story to the market.”

In June last year, Walmart said it would seek to relist Seiyu, following years of speculation that it was seeking to sell the chain after years of poor performance. While a 2018 report in the Nikkei newspaper said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer planned to sell the business for as much as 500 billion yen, the company had repeatedly denied it was looking to exit. The price paid by KKR and Rakuten for the stakes was not disclosed.

Walmart expects to recognize a non-cash loss of about $2 billion after taxes in the fiscal fourth quarter related to the deal, according to a regulatory filing. The company “does not expect a significant impact to earnings per share following completion of the transaction.”

Foreign Failures

Walmart first invested in Seiyu in 2002 and took it private in 2008. But like other foreign retail giants, including Tesco Plc and France’s Carrefour SA, it failed to find success in Japan’s notoriously difficult and low-margin supermarket space, and struggled to compete with local rivals such as Aeon Co. and Seven & i Holdings Co.

Story continues

In 2018, it began working with Rakuten on fresh produce delivery in Japan as well an e-book operation in the U.S. The U.S. giant has been reshaping its international operations to focus on high-potential markets like India and China, and investing to build its digital operations globally as it faces cost pressures and sluggish growth in its home market.

Fresh produce is a 60 trillion yen market in Japan, but only around 3-4% of that is online sales, according to Noriaki Komori, a Rakuten executive officer, creating a growth opportunity. Books and home appliance see about a third of sales online, he said. The pandemic has boosted e-commerce in Japan, where adoption has sometimes lagged other markets, with online clothes shopping and food delivery seeing notable gains.

The pandemic has also been boosting domestic Japanese dealmaking in the second half of the year following a downturn at the start of the outbreak, a surge that private equity firms including KKR as well as Carlyle Group Inc. have been seeking to get involved in. Carlyle in March raised 258 billion yen ($2.5 billion) for its fourth Japan buyout fund, while KKR has been increasing its involvement in the country, declaring Japan in 2019 to be among the most interesting buyout opportunities in the world. The heads of its Japan operations told Jiji in September that it aimed to do one or two deals totalling 300 billion to 700 billion yen a year.

KKR and Carlyle Are Betting on a Resurgence in Japan Dealmaking

The combination of online retailer -- Rakuten runs Japan’s largest online shopping mall -- with traditional brick-and-mortar store has echoes of Amazon.com Inc.’s $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market in 2017. Whole Foods has struggled during the pandemic, however, with foot traffic down an estimated 25%. Amazon’s Japan arm already runs a grocery delivery service with Life Corp., a supermarket chain.

“The world is very different today than it was 18 months ago for all of us,” said Judith McKenna, president of Walmart’s international business. “The world has accelerated in omni channel and digital transformation in the course of this year, not just in Japan but around the globe.”

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Seiyu Chief Executive Officer Lionel Desclee will stay in his role through the transaction and then take a new position within Walmart. A new CEO will then be appointed by a new board comprised of managers from the three owners.

429,2020-11-13T14:00:00+00:00,LinkedIn Co-founder: the number of ‘tech giants’ will double in 5 years,"LinkedIn Co-founder Reid Hoffman joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the future of big tech and the United States' relationship with China under a Biden administration.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: So as we go in to the Biden era, I'm curious as to what you think the direction and tenor of Washington, DC's desire to, perhaps, rein in or regulate the big-tech platforms, what path that's going to take. Because it's-- it's not at all clear cut. You've got Ted Cruz, David Cicilline, now Joe Biden, Sen. Warner, people with very different political perspectives, who seem to share distrust and anxiety about the platforms. But that's where the common ground ends, right?

REID HOFFMAN: Yeah. So look, roughly speaking, I'm-- this is not a no-regulation point of view. But I am a very strong believer that we've now moved to a multi-polar world. China will be building more and more of the technology platforms that matter in the coming years. And actually, to some degree, I hope that there's other places. Like I-- you know, one of the Greylock investments we have is this incubator called Entrepreneur First, which is building tech communities in Europe and in Singapore.

So you know, I hope for-- for more of this. But what that means is you don't disable your own player, right? You don't go hey, let's try to do that. What you want to do is you want to shape them.

You want to say, look, these outcomes, misinformation. Here is our social mandate for how we change that. So we have more truth in the media ecosystem. You know, those kinds of things are important.

But, like, the classic notion of an antitrust or breakup, I think those are, generally speaking, going to be actually, in fact, a counter American health and prosperity. And by the way, I say that as my primary thing as an investor, as new startups, as competing with these large tech companies. So this not like an embodied interest.

But actually, in fact, I think we're-- we have maybe five tech giants today. I think, you know, five years from now, we're going to have 10 tech giants. And those competition between those tech giants is what create lots of space for startups to either, you know, get their initial base, or to grow into being the 11th, or to be bought by one of them. And so that's part of the reason why I think actually, in fact, the-- the antitrust isn't the right thing. But figuring out how to contribute the right way to the health of-- of our society, and global society, is the right thing.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Two questions here. So first of all, when you're talking about going from five to 10, are you talking about the other five being in China? And then, also, what specifically, though, short of anti-trust and breaking things up, would be your remedies?

REID HOFFMAN: So-- so, on the first, actually, in fact, if you're including China, you're like five going to 25. Right? So, it is much larger.

I was actually just talking about, you know, the-- the kind of the growth of companies like, you know, Airbnb and others as they-- as they establish, you know, on the stage.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Who better to weigh in on the challenges of a life at home than billionaire venture capitalist Reid Hoffman? An original member of the tech industry's PayPal Mafia, Hoffman was an early believer in social media, creating one of the internet's first social networks before launching the business-focused site LinkedIn.

Over the years, he's made big bets on companies like Facebook and Airbnb, and now sits on the board of some of the fastest growing startups in Silicon Valley. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I'm joined by Reid Hoffman as we discuss the future of the tech sector, the outcome of the 2020 election, and where he's putting his money to work as we look toward the near year.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest Reid Hoffman, entrepreneur, investor, venture capitalist, partner at VC firm Greylock, and Co-founder of LinkedIn. Reid, great to see you.

REID HOFFMAN: Great to see you as well, even in these modern pandemic times as we do this over Skype.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, exactly. And so much to talk about, Pandemic and the election. Let's start with the election, Reid. And you have supported the Democrats and Joe Biden, invested resources into ousting President Trump. What's the most important reason why Joe Biden won?

REID HOFFMAN: I think the most important reason is actually, in fact, a need to return to stability, to unity rather than division, right? And then to apply expertise to questions like the pandemic. Because even though there might be some politicization about how bad is the pandemic and how much a shutdown is necessary, we should apply public health knowledge. We should apply scientific knowledge. We should apply economic knowledge in order to actually do good governance on it.

Story continues

And I think it's very much a referendum on, no, no, it's not a reality television show. Good governance matters. And I think that's one of the things where Biden, who's a lifelong centrist, who's part of the reason why his inaugural message was, I am here to govern for the entire country for everyone's well-being, not just the people who voted for me, in stark contrast, obviously, to President Trump.

ANDY SERWER: Reid, it's refreshing to hear you speaking out, whether or not I even happen to agree with you politically, because there are a lot of people who won't, business people who won't speak out. And again, either side of the aisle. How hard is it for you to do that? Because obviously, you're alienating some people.

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I definitely get grief. I get grief whether it's in a LinkedIn context or generally. And that's frustrating because most of the places where I try to speak out on this, I'm speaking out on a basis of rule of law, anti-corruption.

It's one of the reasons why I actually posted on LinkedIn recently, kind of like what is the-- and on Greylock, why CEOs should speak up in politics in some times. Because it isn't that speaking up on politics is necessarily being partisan.

If you're kind of like, look, what we want is we want stability, we want actionability to kind of work together, those kinds of things, that claim, if it is partisan, that it's partisan only on the side of goodness. Now, there are other times where I will also make some claims because there's a particular value that I like and many of those values are on the Democratic side.

But obviously, I'm very pro-business. And very pro-entrepreneurship. I'm very pro-technology. So there's a stack of things where I will articulate those. But as business people, if we want a centrist country, we want to not be run by the extremes of either the left or the right, you do need to speak up with the things that are the baseline centrism. Rule of law, count every vote, peaceful transition of power. These things matter for the health of our country and for the health of business.

ANDY SERWER: Well, let's talk about that a little bit more, then. I mean, President Trump has said, I didn't lose the election and is challenging and contesting the results in specific states that he's lost by even an excess of 100,000 votes. He's lost the popular vote by close to 5 million. How do you think this is going to play out?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think ultimately, we will see a transition of power. I think we will see sabotage from Trump and his administration on that transition. I think that sabotage is essentially anti-American. It's anti not just rule of law and process, but in good governance, for all of us as American citizens who live here.

And that's, I think, because President Trump has fundamentally more approached governance as a reality television show, including the COVID stuff. Like, I have a good feeling that it's going to go away. Hey, maybe you can inject bleach, right? Because, of course, you're not talking to actually medical experts and doctors on this.

And I think that's going to be a real problem and I think it's going to have a lasting impact on the divisions in the country. Because actually, in fact, we should be saying, hey, we should be coming together. We should be building our way out of the pandemic.

That should be-- you could just imagine the superstars on the Republican side, George W. Bush and other folks kind of going, OK, this is actually, in fact, we should be coming together as a country. This is essentially what we should be doing.

And I think this refusal to admit it, to treating it like it's a reality television star, of like, you know Donald Trump is on ""The Apprentice"" and refuses to be fired, is simply one more dismissive of the health of American society.

ANDY SERWER: Does this hurt the economy, Reid? And maybe in particular, Silicon Valley, and what's the conversation there like?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it definitely hurts the economy, because people frequently associate business only with free flowing capital, lower taxes, and lower regulation. And there's lots of things that help actually affect business.

Like, for example, a stable society that's predictable, an environment that you can invest in, and successful use of talent, a healthy and thriving middle class that can buy goods and services. And so actually, in fact, there's a lot of different approaches that are being pro-business, and this kind of chaos is anti-business, because it--

Now, relative to Silicon Valley, which, obviously, we're fortunate that technology is what's driving a lot of the changes in industry and in the future. So a lot of Silicon Valley investors and businesses are all benefiting from this.

Even in COVID, where we see Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, said it very well. In the first two months of the pandemic, he said, in two months, we've seen two years of digital transformation where people are using the technologies and adopting them more quickly and more thoroughly because they need to in order to keep business running. So it's been good for all that. But instability is bad for all business, including technology.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned the social media platforms of which you are so familiar. How do you think they performed and what's your assessment of what happened during this election cycle?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think we're on a learning curve, and it kind of is unfortunate that we get to experience the learning curve versus get a complete plan and release it at scale. Because I think a lot of what has happened, which both Facebook and Twitter did in the last month, is stuff you wish they'd been doing for five plus years of, hey, this is actually counter to the experts, counter to facts.

This is dangerous. This is an incitement to violence. And saying, look, we're going to frame that and we're going to make sure that people are aware of that. And I think those are the beginnings of the steps in the right direction for what should actually, in fact, be persistent.

Like, for example, you've seen some of it even drop off now. Because they said, oh, the election is over. It's been called, so release that. And you're like, well, actually, in fact, people calling for election theft, which is, by the way, all the experts, including all the Republican experts, look at this and say, look, you can challenge on some narrow states and recount the ballot, but it's not going to make a difference.

Because at these numbers and at the safety of our voting systems, including the vote by mail, those have all called it. And actually, there's one particular piece I just-- I feel like I'm compelled to say, which is there was this kind of constant Republican line of, you're adding in points after the game is called.

And you're like, OK. If we want to use a metaphor, it's like you scored a leading touchdown in the third quarter, the third quarter of the game, and you want to call the game end versus waiting for the fourth quarter, right?

Like, it is, actually, in fact, every state has a law to set its vote by mail and doing vote by mail. That's not calling the game early. That's calling the game on time. And promoting that is destructive to our democracy. People should understand that, actually, every vote does count.

And it's really important that as a democracy. Like, I treasure people who I disagree with, their ability to vote. It's super important that we are in this together. And that's the legitimacy of the election results.

ANDY SERWER: We're talking mostly here about Facebook, and Twitter, and YouTube. But what about LinkedIn, Reid? Is LinkedIn immune from misinformation?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, no social media platform is completely immune because part of what you enable is you enable everyone to have a voice and to put something on. And one of the things that's a little unfortunate about them modern media ecosystem, which includes social media, is it reminds me of a Winston Churchill quote which is, a lie travels around the world three times before the truth has a chance to put its boots on.

And truth is slow in the way that it kind of works, and that's one of the things I think we need to kind of figure out as we benefit from increasing speed in communication and so forth. And so I think even LinkedIn has challenges with it.

Where it's easier for us because people tie their professional reputation, the theming is things about business. And so you don't tend to get-- like, we had a little bit of QAnon stuff because of people who put it on. You don't tend to get as much of the lackey QAnon stuff.

But we also had to kind of go, OK, this is not according to LinkedIn terms of service, so we're pulling this off. And so it has a little, but not as much as the other platforms have to contend with.

ANDY SERWER: So as we go into the Biden era, I'm curious as to what you think the direction and tenor of Washington, DC's desire to perhaps rein in or regulate the big tech platforms, what path that's going to take.

Because it's not at all clear cut. You've got Ted Cruz, David Cicilline, now Joe Biden, Senator Warner, people with very different political perspectives who seem to share distrust and anxiety about the platforms. But that's where the common ground ends, right?

REID HOFFMAN: So look, roughly speaking, I'm a-- this is not a no regulation point of view, but I am a very strong believer that we've now moved to a multipolar world. China will be building more and more of the technology platforms that matter in the coming years.

And actually, to some degree, I hope that there's other places. Like, one of the Greylock investments we have is this incubator called Entrepreneur First, which is building tech communities in Europe and in Singapore. So I hope for more of this.

But what that means is you don't disable your own player, right? You don't go, hey, let's try to do that. What you want to do is you want to shape them. You want to say, look, these outcomes, misinformation. Here is our social mandate for how we change that so we have more truth in the media ecosystem. Those kinds of things are important.

But the classic notion of an antitrust or a breakup, I think those are, generally speaking, going to be actually, in fact, a counter American health and prosperity. And by the way, I say that as my primary thing as an investor, as new startups, as competing with these large tech companies.

So it's not like an embodied interest. But actually, in fact, I think where we have maybe five tech giants today, I think five years from now, we're going to have 10 tech giants. And those competition between those tech giants is what create lots of space for startups to either get their initial base, or to grow into being the 11th, or to be bought by one of them.

And so that's part of the reason why I think actually, in fact, the antitrust isn't the right thing, but figuring out how to contribute the right way to the health of our society and global society is the right thing.

ANDY SERWER: Well, two questions here. So first of all, when you're talking about going from five to 10, are you talking about the other five being in China? And then also, what specifically, though, short of antitrust and breaking things up, would be your remedies?

REID HOFFMAN: So on the first-- actually, in fact, if you're including China, you're like five going to 25, right? So it is much larger. I was actually just talking about kind of the growth of companies like Airbnb and others as they establish on the stage.

And obviously, there's a bunch right now around Netflix, and Salesforce, and other kinds of things. So I think there's a range of these companies to become multipart technology platforms. And with China, you're going to see a ton more.

And then I think in terms of-- it's one of the things that I've actually started working on in 2019 and then I got very concerned about the 2020 election, so I'm going to get back to it soon. But it's kind of the question of, how do we build the full-- what are the tools and sets we can do to build kind of regulation of the outcomes we want, but don't try to enshrine the past? Allow adaptation in the future.

I'll give you one kind of like, microcosm example. Like, say you said, look, we don't want to have video depictions of live streams of terrorist assaults, or murderers, or anything else. So you say, what's the way you would regulate that?

Well, a simple way, like, if I was going to try to regulate, if I was in charge of regulating that today, what I would say is, OK, here's our law. It's $10,000 fine purview. And the companies have to self report, but they have to self report through their auditors. Like, the auditors have to say, this was actually, in fact, done well.

And so they self report and then we say, OK, so we assess the fines and we take whatever dollar amount. I've kind of pulled a number out of air. But take whatever dollar amount you want. That's the right thing. Because trying to go to zero seems kind of crazy.

And, by the way, people do individually, accidentally, terrifyingly do see live murders. So one person saw it or people saw it is not actually, in fact, society destabilizing. It's unfortunate and terrible, but not that. And then you set it.

And then, by the way, it then becomes the tech company's ability to try to figure out, OK, what do we do? Do we have AI that's scanning for it? Do we have a 15 second or five minute delay or what all.

As opposed to mandating it, which is what enshrines the past against the future, you're saying, here is our economic incentive to you to continue to iterate and solve this problem in the right way, right? And then enable that to happen.

And that's, I think, the kind of pattern that you generally need to see happening with technology because it moves so fast and we want to build to the solutions of which is the better solutions are in the future.

ANDY SERWER: I know you're Mr. AI here, so obviously, you think AI is part of the solution. But it's also pretty clear, I bet you'd admit, that it's not the 100% solution. You obviously need human oversight, human intervention, human action.

So I'm curious about your understanding, your thought process when it comes to mix and if you hire more people. I mean, Zuck has hired thousands, tens of thousands of more people to try to mitigate this, but then your margins go down. Although that hasn't seemed to impact those businesses much, right? How do you feel about that?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, so I think it's totally fine to hire a bunch more people. I mean, one of the things that we have is about these global businesses. This is, again, one of the reasons why the businesses that will succeed in this stuff tend to have a very large footprint, which is one of the reasons why I, again, tend to be not-- like, if you said you want these businesses to be American businesses, to not have an antitrust, like a breakup solution.

So yes, maybe you have to hire 10,000 people. But if you're serving up billions in the world, then actually, in fact, hiring 10,000 or 50,000 people, that actually, in fact, does work. And then, of course, again, as you're inventing in the future, one of the things that you tend to do is you say, well, how do we get AI tools that even make those people more efficient and more effective?

And by way, just on your AI point, it's actually, in fact, one of the things that I help stand up and I'm the chair of the advisory board is the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. Because precisely the whole question is, how do you have a AI that has very positive human impact? Whether it's jobs, whether it's equality, or kind of a fairness in society and all those things and make sure that we're doing all of those with these very complicated AI systems?

ANDY SERWER: That's a fascinating point there about the work you're doing at Stanford. I didn't know about that. That's really amazing. Interesting. I want to ask you about China a little bit more.

There are people who are suggesting that we're going to be entering a new Cold War with China and it's going to be based on a technology rivalry. I mean, not such a far fetched or crazy notion at all. I think it's really just a question of degree. In other words, how much coopetition will there be or how dystopian and fractured will the world be along these two ecosystems, if you will?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think this is one of the things that, again, kind of back to the politics, is great that we have a change in the White House. Because you both need competition, and Americans, winning, things that are important to us.

By the way, the spread of American platforms, the dying, the Chinese, those platforms are actually a terrible, bad idea. Because say, hey, buy American technology. We're going to be buying Chinese technology. We already are today.

IPhone is kind of a mixed. Designed in Cupertino, but built in China, as an example. And so I think that the important thing is to really focus on is coopetition. Unfortunately, a little bit of the kind of competitive rhetoric, the Chinese hawks, are like, they want China to fail.

China is an important part of the global economy. If China fails, we all fail. And so I think that that bridge building is really important, while still, of course, fiercely competing and making sure that China plays its fair and just role on the world stage.

Doesn't kind of pretend it's an emerging economy anymore, isn't allowed IP theft, that kind of thing, where it's like, no, no, you have to play. We have to have a collective set of rules that we all play together that allow the world to progress.

ANDY SERWER: Maybe just to drill down a little bit more here, Reid, but isn't a bifurcated technology, economic system sort of inevitable in the sense that you're going to have a situation where they're never going to let the US, say, social media platforms in?

I don't know what's going to happen with TikTok. That seems to have been forgotten now, which is fascinating. But when it comes to chips, when it comes to Huawei and competing, you know, against Ericsson and the Western companies, isn't that really going to get worse?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it will get worse. But I think the important thing is to actually-- look, this is one of the things that I'm hopeful about in kind of a Biden administration An eternal thing is, have a technology strategy, right? Actually, in fact, be saying what are the things that we should be building to?

Because, for example, not giving up on the hardware and the chip side I think is super important. I think actually, in fact, doubling down on the things that where a lot of the deep tech AI platforms is happening over in China. The Chinese government wants to be in the lead in 2030.

Well, actually, in fact, the US ecosystems with universities, and the companies, and so forth, is in the lead today. Well, work on that. Try to maintain that. Try to make that happen. And I that's part of it. Now, I think what we'll see is we'll-- some stuff will be in China. Some stuff will be in the US. Some stuff will be in Europe.

That will be a good universe of interdependency because part of the whole-- what's awesome about capitalism, one of things is, make trade, not war. Like, as we have these interdependencies, those are actually very, very good for us in a stable world order.

And so I think we want that. But I do think that it's going to be-- look, it's going to be hard and there's going to be some definite collisions, fender benders, scratches, and it's going to take leadership to work through it.

ANDY SERWER: Let's talk about COVID, and the pandemic, and this time that we're living in, which is so crazy. But what it's done, it's exacerbated the divisions in society, not the least of which, say, were the banks, and the tech stocks, and tech companies in Silicon Valley from the rest of the US economy, never mind the rest of society.

So you had this just incredible increase in valuation of these companies now maybe coming back to Earth because of a vaccine. I mean, so what is your sort of top line thinking? Then we can drill down a little bit more after that.

REID HOFFMAN: Well, my top line thinking is, obviously, this last year is the difference between kind of reasonable government and terrible government. Because we paid trillions of dollars of debt, millions of job losses, and hundreds of thousands of lives that we didn't need to pay.

And anyone who looks at the numbers, you kind of say, OK, 5x the cases and the fatalities of the average of the rest of the world. Now, we've got some glimmerings of greatness. The Gates Foundation and companies, private enterprise going out and building vaccines at a rapid pace and all the rest of that. That's great.

But I think we need to return to a belief in science, a belief in expertise, a belief in, like Dr. Fauci, who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, is a very credible expert who's just a truth teller. It's a super important place for us to be as Americans, and that should never be politicized in any particular way.

Now, I think what that's going to come to is we're going to have another year of turbulence. Because as we figure out the kinds of things of, look, wearing a mask is part of how I'm caring for my fellow Americans, not spreading disease to them. We're going to need that.

Even as we do vaccines, I fear that we'll begin to politicize take the vaccine or not, versus the, no, no, no, my way of-- because people don't quite usually understand vaccines. They think vaccine is I'm immune. And actually, it isn't that. It's harder for me to get it.

So a lot of us have to take it to eliminate it. It's like a superpowered mask to eliminate it from the viral spread, what the experts call R0 as the incense. And we're going to need to do that. And why do we want to do that?

Well, because our productivity will be hit so much worse than basically all of these other countries. Like, than China, which, for example, I think Shanghai hasn't had a new case in like, 250 days, right? There's more cases in the White House than there is in Shanghai.

If we want to get back to an American economy, we need to get to a place where we have the disease under control and it's super important. So we should be accelerating towards that. And hopefully, by assembling experts, like that Biden has already assembled a group of great people, including someone who was one of the early whistleblowers under Trump, and say, hey, this is what we're going to pull together in order to solve this disease both for health, but also for the economy.

ANDY SERWER: But isn't it the case that sort of perversely, Reid, that when this vaccine or vaccines are out there, that the valuations of these tech companies will go down?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, some of them, and that's fine. I mean, look, the valuation of these tech companies are already so high that that's not a problem. So you've got to-- like, if the ones where investors think, oh, the only reason that's being so used is because of the pandemic, fine, we'd much rather get back to everyone going to work. And the valuation will still be more than high enough for everyone's happiness, including investors.

ANDY SERWER: So my understanding is that the VC world has been robust during this time. Is that the case? And if so, why?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, it's kind of a surprise. When we've looked at earlier kind of collisions, things that happened, including 2008 and so forth, all of this-- the VC market, generally speaking, have kind of retrenched, reserve the portfolio for the current companies, using other recessions, the internet boss and other things as a model.

And in this case, part of what happened is partially because of the LP money into the venture funds, the wide set of venture funds. I think it's because a lot of capital also thinks, OK, technology is the future, so capital around the world is looking for technology investments.

So all of that flowed in and so everyone went, well, actually, in fact, I can make this work. I can talk through Skype. I can talk through Teams. I can talk through Zoom. And I'll tell you, we at Greylock have been making a whole set of investments with teams and people we've never met, right? They've only been this little box on the screen.

Now, of course we still do the reference checking, and we still do our due diligence, and calling customers, and all the rest. But we're like, oh, look, there's-- and I think, by the way, a bunch of people are going, OK, the entrepreneurs are still like, well, we're not waiting. We're not hanging around for the pandemic.

We're building, and we're creating new things, and new available products. And at Greylock, we've been doing a lot of enterprise most recently, because we've seen all kinds of new enterprise opportunities. But there's obviously a whole range.

ANDY SERWER: That's so crazy. So you do enough due diligence so that when you finally meet this person maybe next summer you'll say, I didn't know you were tall. Everything else about you, I knew--

REID HOFFMAN: Yes, exactly.

ANDY SERWER: --or that kind of thing.

REID HOFFMAN: Exactly.

ANDY SERWER: One thing we haven't touched on that much, you mentioned inequality a little bit. And I want to ask what you're doing and what venture can specifically do to address racial and social bias.

REID HOFFMAN: So racial and social bias is one of the things we have. It's a stain on our entire society, and especially some areas like obviously tech and investing are, just by the numbers, clearly retrograde in this.

And so it's one of those places where you have to look at yourself and say, if I'm not part of the solution, then I'm part of the problem. And so Greylock, for example, we looked at this and said, look, the key thing is to make sure there's a whole bunch of great people of color, minority, other kind of things, disadvantaged minority talent out there.

We just need to build a network connectivity so that they have connectivity to investment if they're founders to these early companies, if they're kind of professionals and executives. And so we did that. So we said, OK, let's dive deep.

And we did a partnership with Management Leaders of Tomorrow, which, founded and CO by John Rice, who is the brother of Susan Rice, who has already spent well over a decade building these pathways for how do you identify great talent.

And now we're going to try to help map that talent into the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. And we're-- one of the things that we do at Greylock is we pride ourselves on being good partners with entrepreneurs, but even with other investors.

And we say, OK, let's try to make sure that that whole talent network is connected well throughout the entire Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. Because ultimately, that's how you get to kind of the fairness, to the justice.

Which is, you have those network pathways by which people can then find the right opportunities. And so that's one of n things that we're doing at Greylock in order to try to be kind of good protagonists of the future.

ANDY SERWER: I know you could probably talk about this for an hour or more. But what are a few things that you look for when you're trying to identify a successful startup, Reid?

REID HOFFMAN: So generally speaking, it can be different patterns. But the simple stuff is, oh my gosh, this could be an industry transforming company where the time is now. Sometimes because of technology change, sometimes because of market change, other kinds of things.

That the founder has enough of the raw knowledge to get moving, and is a learner, and has that raw kind of grit and adaptability to go through all of the different phases that these startups go through. Like, the example in my last book, ""Blitzscaling,"" I kind of described those five phases of size.

And the rules change at each phase of size. Like, how you run the company, what management looks like, are you multithreaded, single threaded? And then you can do all that. And then where do you look at relative to competition?

Because one of the really fundamental things, which I just did in my most recent kind of ""Greymatter"" podcast and essay, was that competition, like, what does the competition look like, is really central to how you do it.

So that's the suite at which you look at. And then that suite, you kind of go, OK, and then it's art and science. You can't just kind of pencil the numbers. It isn't just do a DCS analysis. It's like, yeah, I think so.

ANDY SERWER: Right, right. Great. And finally, Reid, you have seen millions of profiles on LinkedIn. And so I'm curious, what advice do you have for people who are applying to jobs online right now amid COVID-19 and how do they stand out from the competition?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think that some of the things are put extra energy into it. Like, for example, one of the features, a small thing on LinkedIn is I like having references. Having, like-- but even if you're mailings say, hey, here's three people from-- like, you would say, here's three people who would be references for me and here's the link to their LinkedIn profile.

So people are, OK, showing that different thing. Like, another thing that I've kind of encouraged both companies individuals to do is while, generally speaking, I think recording a video interview of yourself in a normal thing is probably not that useful.

In this time of COVID, it is very useful, right? Because people are sitting, watching screens all the time. It's like, OK, watch another video. So record a little video about why you're interested in this job, who you are, and here's my link to my LinkedIn profile or wherever you're kind of storing your professional credentials. I think that's very helpful.

And then, of course, always try to use your network so that people understand that you are hardworking, collaborative, and other kinds of things which are the attributes you generally only get through references or network.

431,2020-11-11T15:03:45+00:00,How Singles' Day compares to Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day,"Alibaba’s (BABA) Singles’ Day has quickly become the biggest online shopping event in the world. Once again, you can expect it to dwarf digital sales in the U.S. for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Day.

Started to celebrate being single in China, Singles’ Day always falls on November 11 because the date 11/11 represents four singles standing together. The holiday became a monster shopping event beginning in 2009 with Alibaba offering steep, round-the-clock discounts. Today the holiday is for all, with competitors like JD.com (JD) and Pinduoduo (PDD) also offering deals on November 11.

Alibaba saw sales for its Singles’ Day festival total more than 498.2 billion yuan, or over $75 billion, up from 268 billion yuan of purchases last year, Bloomberg reported Wednesday just after 11 a.m. ET. The e-commerce giant started the sale earlier this year, with sales lasting 11 days instead of 24 hours.

Last year about half a billion shoppers bought about $38.4 billion worth of goods on Alibaba’s platforms. That’s a 26% increase year over year.

Singles’ Day performance was higher than the five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday in which U.S. shoppers spent a record $28.49 billion online last year, according to Adobe Analytics data. Some $7.2 billion was spent on Black Friday, while Cyber Monday generated $9.4 billion in digital sales.

Meanwhile Amazon’s Prime Day, seen by some this year as the unofficial start to the holiday season, brought in about $10.4 billion in sales, up 45% from last year’s $7.14 billion in sales.

Alibaba added a promotional window from Nov 1 - Nov 3, ahead of this week’s official event, giving a glimpse of how foreign brands are performing.

Bloomberg reports during the first 111 minutes of sales on Nov. 1, Nike (NKE) and Apple (AAPL) were some of the 100 brands generating about $15 million in transactions. Esteé Lauder (EL) was the first to surpass 1 billion yuan in sales on the company’s Tmall platform.

There's growth, and then there's super-growth. Using the GuruFocus Fast Growers screener, we can find stocks that have a history of strong growth. This screener measures growth through the five-year revenue per share growth rate, the five-year Ebitda per share growth rate, the 10-year revenue per share growth rate and the 10-year Ebitda per share growth rate.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA. Click here to check it out.  BABA 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of BABA Peter Lynch Chart of BABA

According to these screening criteria, the below stocks were the fastest growers on the market as of Nov. 9: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

Alibaba

China's equivalent to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), roughly speaking, has become a giant since it went public in 2014. Co-founded by Jack Ma in 1999, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) now has a market cap of just under $800 billion and could soon become a trillion-dollar company.

As the table above shows, its five-year revenue per share growth rate has been exceptional, as has been its five-year Ebitda per share growth rate.

Alibaba generates revenue and Ebitda through four operating segments: core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment and innovation initiatives.

Growth is driven by many factors, not least among them:

A shift to online shopping, especially since the Coronavirus pandemic The growing Chinese middle class and expanding disposable incomes Economies of scale The application of capital to fast-growing technologies

As fellow GuruFocus contributor Ben Reynolds wrote last year, ""The company continues to grow much more quickly than the Chinese economy as it takes full advantage of its growing suite of products and services that appeal to a wide variety of Chinese consumers and businesses alike.""

It also boasts one of the strongest sets of fundamentals among all publicly-traded companies: GuruFocus rates its financial strength 8 out of 10 and its profitability 9 out of 10.

Story continues

Alibaba does not pay a dividend and its share buyback ratio over the past three years has been negative. The GuruFocus Value chart finds it to be fairly-valued. It was held by 36 gurus at the end of the second quarter.

Patrick Industries

A small-cap stock, Patrick Industries Inc (NASDAQ:PATK) has a market cap of $1.28 billion. Its manufacturing segment, responsible for 70% of sales, sells laminated and vinyl products, including furniture, shelving and countertops. Its distribution segment, with 30% of sales, sells mainly prefinished wall and ceiling panels to the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries.

The Elkhart, Indiana-based company's 10-year revenue per share growth rate was 27.6% and its 10-year Ebitda per share growth rate was 42.30%. The five and 10-year revenue growth rates are about the same, while the 10-year Ebitda growth rate was roughly 11 points higher than the five-year rate; this suggests the company has become less efficient in the past five years.

What drives its growth? In its 10-K for 2019, the company reported:

""The Company's strategic and capital allocation strategy is to optimally manage and utilize its resources and leverage its platform of operating brands to continue to grow and reinvest in its business.""

Tactically, Patrick Industries lists these initiatives:

Strategic acquisitions, Geographic expansion Expansion into new product lines Investment in infrastructure and capital expenditures

It has taken on a lot of debt in recent years, which helps account for the 5 out of 10 rating for financial strength. It also has some of the best margins in the vehicles and parts industry, leading to an 8 out of 10 rating for profitability.

Its dividend yield is 1.85%, and over the past three years it has had a negative share buyback ratio. The GuruFocus Value chart finds the stock to be fairly valued, while the PEG ratio, at 0.58, suggests the stock is undervalued. Patrick Industries is held by two gurus, Chuck Royce (Trades, Portfolio) of Royce & Associates and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) of Renaissance Technologies.

Netflix

No introduction is needed for the world-famous streaming service giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Over the past five and 10 years, it has grown its revenue per share by 29.20% and 25.20% respectively, and its Ebitda per share by 30.10% and 39.40%, respectively. Like Patrick Industries, Netflix has been less efficient over the past five years.

It explained its growth in the risk section of its most recent 10-K as follows:

""Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships.""

Whatever its model, Netflix has been wildly successful, as shown in this comparative chart in the 10-K: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

Because of its increasing debt load, it earns only a 5 out of 10 rating for financial strength. On the other hand, the rating for profitability is very good at 9 out of 10.

It pays no dividend and has not increased its earnings per share with buybacks. The GuruFocus Value chart lists Netflix as being fairly-valued, while the PEG ratio shows overvaluation at 2.76. Twenty-two of the gurus followed by GuruFocus had positions in the stock as of June 30.

Ubiquiti

Based in New York City, Ubiquiti Inc. (NYSE:UI) described itself this way in its 10-K for 2020:

""We develop technology platforms for high-capacity distributed Internet access, unified information technology, and consumer electronics for professional, home and personal use. We categorize our solutions into three main categories: high performance networking technology for service providers, enterprises and consumers. We target the service provider and enterprise markets through our highly engaged community of service providers, distributors, value added resellers, systems integrators and corporate IT professionals, which we refer to as the Ubiquiti Community. We target consumers through digital marketing, retail chains and, to a lesser extent, the Ubiquiti Community.""

Its revenue per share has grown at a rate of 25.10% in the past five years and 23.50% in the past 10 years. Ebitda growth averaged 27.80% per year over the last five years and 34.40% per year over the last 10 years. In this case, Ebitda and profitability slipped in the past half-decade.

Ubiquiti is a tech company and is driven by research and development. In fact, the company reported, ""the majority of our human capital resources consist of entrepreneurial and de-centralized research and development (""R&D"") personnel."" Specifically, 714 of its 1,021 employees work in R&D.

It does not employ a sales force, relying instead on online reviews, its distributors and its user communities. The latter can connect directly with R&D, marketing and support teams.

Because it has a strong R&D operation, the company has a portfolio of patents and proprietary technologies. It combines these with low-cost hardware to build lower-priced solutions for its customers. These solutions become integrated with the hardware and software of its customers, thus ensuring it loses few customers.

Its debt has grown in recent years, so it receives only a 5 out of 10 rating for financial strength. Its profitability, though, is as good as it gets, a rare 10 out of 10, spurred partially by a return on equity (ROE) of more than 52%.

It pays a dividend of 0.5%, which is unexpected for a growth-focused tech company. Share buybacks are also on the management menu, as the share buyback ratio over the past three years was 7.4. This should push up earnings per share significantly if it keeps going. According to the GuruFocus Value chart, Ubiquiti's share price is significantly overvalued. The PEG ratio is 1.54, which suggests a much lower level of overvaluation. Seven of the gurus followed by GuruFocus have positions in the stock.

Five Below

Based in Philadelphia, Five Below Inc (NASDAQ:FIVE) is defying the trend away from brick and mortar businesses. It operated more than 900 stores in the U.S. at the end of 2019. They cater to teen and preteen consumers, with a wide assortment of merchandise mostly priced at or below $6.00.

Leisure products, including sporting goods, toys and electronics, were the biggest sellers, making up 50% of last year's sales. It also offers merchandise in the fashion and home categories as well as the party and snack goods categories. It had stores in 36 U.S. states and four distribution centers at the end of 2019.

As it has grown over the past decade, it has increased its revenue consistently: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

It has also grown its Ebitda consistently: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

What's behind these growth numbers? This information from the 10-K for 2019 gives us several clues:

""We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a differentiated merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept, which allows our customers to ""Let Go and Have Fun."" Based on our management's experience and industry knowledge, we believe our customer-centric, experience-first, innovative approach to retail has led to a fiercely loyal customer base and has fostered universal appeal across a variety of age groups beyond our target demographic.""

In other words, a unique shopping experience targeted to its core market of preteens and teens provides its advantage. It also involves ""trend-right"" merchandise, a clear value proposition, a differentiated shopping experience, a powerful store model and a team of passionate managers.

After taking on new debt this year, the company receives a financial strength rating of 6 out of 10 from the GuruFocus system. Its profitability rating is high at 9 out of 10.

Five Below does not issue dividends and its share buyback ratio for the past three years is negative. It is modestly overvalued according to the GuruFocus Value chart. The PEG ratio is in the same territory at 3.25. Among the gurus, four owned the stock at the end of the second quarter.

Conclusion

Alibaba, Patrick Industries, Netflix, Ubiquiti and Five Below are fast-growing stocks that have rewarded their shareholders, even though most do not pay dividends or buy back their shares. They are growth companies with high profitability.

Profitability opens many doors for corporations with ambitious plans. It means more funding for new lines of business, expansion of existing lines and strategic acquisitions. Subject to each investor's own due diligence, I think these may be attractive candidates.

Overall, though, they would best fit into the plans of growth investors. Value investors won't find underpriced, debt-free names here, at least not for now. Income investors also will want to look elsewhere for more mature companies that have established competitive dividends.

433,2020-11-10T11:33:02+00:00,Billionaire Activism Is Alive and Well in Paris,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Shareholder activism is alive and well in Paris. Mall owner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield’s plan to raise 3.5 billion euros ($4.1 billion) to gird its balance sheet for Covid-19 was voted down by investors after opposition led by billionaire Xavier Niel and former boss Leon Bressler. Their victory is strengthened by winning three seats on the firm’s supervisory board.

This speaks to the credibility of their campaign, but also to Unibail management’s blinkered defense. In a land where dissidents don’t usually win, it’s a big moment.

French activist campaigns often flounder when met with the tight-knit resistance of a cozy Parisian elite who don’t take well to being bossed around by hedge funds. But the Unibail battle turned that template upside down. The credible faces and arguments were on the side of the activists: Telecoms mogul Niel’s experience with debt markets and deep pockets, combined with Bressler’s long career in commercial property, lent weight to their arguments against a rights offer that promised heavy dilution: Why not sell more assets, or borrow more, especially as Unibail has ample cash to hand?

Unibail Chief Executive Officer Christophe Cuvillier’s obstinate refusal to engage with the activists’ arguments — on a call with analysts he said he and his team were not “fools” — made things worse, locking his side into an all-or-nothing bet. His view became increasingly one of a glass-half-empty: Without a capital increase to bring down Unibail’s borrowings, the firm might lose its credit rating, pay more to raise debt and be exposed to a worsening pandemic. Even as a shareholder proxy firm advised delaying a rights issue to explore options, Cuvillier stood firm.

This stance only added to the impression that Unibail’s plan was driven less by facts on the ground and more by trying to defend a strategy that had failed to pay off even before the health crisis struck. Niel and Bressler could credibly point to Cuvillier’s debt-laden expansion in the U.S. and U.K., driven by the 2018 acquisition of Westfield Corp., as the original cause of the firm’s indebtedness. Unibail simply didn’t look in control of its destiny, with pressure to raise capital coming from short sellers and investment bankers. Confidence had eroded.

Story continues

Cuvillier could have offered an olive branch to the investors with a compromise deal but chose not to — right up to the eleventh hour on Monday, when Pfizer Inc.’s positive vaccine announcement sent Unibail’s stock up some 30%. This was a sign that a strategy based on the worst-case scenario was on rocky terrain, especially for a stock trading at a near-80% discount to asset value until yesterday.

While this is obviously a big victory for Niel and Bressler, Cuvillier’s inflexibility ultimately sealed his defeat. He would do well to learn the lesson from this and take a more constructive approach now that his opponents are inside the tent. Covid-19’s second wave is far from over, Unibail needs to restructure and reorganize and the shopping-mall industry faces structural threats from the likes of Amazon.com Inc. Still, for the ordinary shareholder, it looks for once like a deserved victory against an investor-unfriendly outcome.

435,2020-11-10T10:08:06+00:00,"DHL, FedEx and UPS Are Ready to Save the World","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In normal times, globe-spanning logistics groups such as Deutsche Post AG, FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. quietly keep the economy humming.

Covid-19 has recast that unassuming role in a more heroic light. When the pandemic history is written, the logistics industry will deserve a volume. “UPS-ers are essential workers,” the U.S. company’s boss Carol Tome told investors recently.

Their most important task — quickly and safely delivering billions of doses of a coronavirus vaccine worldwide — still lies ahead. The massive demand and the ultra-cold temperatures required to store some promising vaccine candidates (including the one developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE) will provide an unprecedented logistical challenge.

Thanks to early preparation and heavy investment, the companies think they’re in good shape to tackle it. Happily for shareholders, the vaccine effort could further juice the industry’s strong recent earnings and share price performance.

The logistics groups have been under immense strain, so it’s hard to begrudge them their good fortune. Bulk deliveries were hit early in the pandemic when businesses and factories were closed, so couriers suddenly had to deliver more to residential addresses, which is more expensive. When land borders closed and passenger planes were grounded, the industry was also called upon to get personal protective clothing and ventilators where they were needed.

Right now, the companies are focused on saving Christmas. An unprecedented volume of holiday gifts will be purchased online this year. Deutsche Post’s DHL express-delivery unit expects holiday season volumes to be more than 50% higher than in 2019.

As housebound populations “buy more stuff,” the big parcel networks have pounced on the golden opportunity, hiring tens of thousands of workers. Most businesses have imposed surcharges on customers to reflect the difficulty of delivering during a pandemic.

Story continues

Because of their large fixed costs, express-delivery networks make more money when more packages flow through them. Deutsche Post’s operating profit jumped by almost half year-on-year in the July to September quarter. The German company expects full-year free cash flow to exceed 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) and operating profit of up to 4.4 billion euros, a record. Since a March low, its shares have doubled. FedEx’s have almost trebled.

Airfreight has become particularly lucrative. Much of the world’s air cargo normally travels in the bellies of passenger jets, which have been grounded. Deutsche Post and FedEx benefit from their absence because each company owns hundreds of dedicated airfreighters.

Shipping an estimated 10 billion doses of the vaccine will make yet more demands of airfreight, requiring some 15,000 flights over the next two years, Deutsche Post estimated in a recent study.(1)

Some potential vaccines will need to be stored at very low temperatures, which plays to the strengths of big logistics providers. UPS has invested in two giant “freezer farms” in Kentucky and the Netherlands, capable of storing millions of doses at temperature as low as -80 Celsius. FedEx has more than 90 cold chain facilities worldwide and plans more.

Coupled with the existing shortage of airfreight capacity, the exacting handling requirements could inflate shipping costs. Detlef Trefzger, chief executive officer of Kuehne + Nagel International AG, a big freight forwarder, said recently that his company wasn’t a government body and therefore the market rate “will be applicable.” Berenberg analysts say vaccine delivery could create a period of “supernormal” profits in logistics.

In theory, once a vaccine is widely available, the favorable pricing dynamics supporting the industry will normalize somewhat. Deutsche Post, FedEx and UPS shares fell on Monday, even as the stock market surged.

However, the e-commerce shift is likely to be permanent, and analysts say airfreight markets could remain tight for at least a couple more years. If a vaccine leads to increased trade flows, the logistics groups will benefit.

As with Amazon.com Inc., the delivery industry risks a backlash if it’s seen to profit excessively from the pandemic. But if vaccines are delivered safely and our holiday gifts arrive on time, the companies will have earned our gratitude, and a commensurate reward.

(1) The 10 billion dose estimate is based on 70% of the global population requiring vaccination to achieve herd immunity, and an average of 1.8 doses per recipient.

436,2020-11-09T23:17:16+00:00,V.F. Corp CEO: Why we bought Supreme for $2.1 billion,"V.F. Corp. (VFC) CEO Steve Rendle is taking his apparel giant to the Streets for its next leg of growth.

The owner of The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Dickies said Monday it will acquire Supreme for $2.1 billion.

Rendle tells Yahoo Finance the acquisition reflects his bullishness on streetwear longer-term, and Supreme’s leadership role in the space.

Supreme has made a name for itself since its founding in 1994 by offering high quality exclusive product drops. They tend to sell out quickly, which often leads to things like hoodies fetching over $1,000 on resale sites. The company has 12 retail stores and relies on digital for nearly 60% of its sales. The Supreme logo appears on a plastic shopping bag in Fort Lee, N.J., Monday, Nov. 9, 2020. VF Corp., the owner of The North Face, Vans and Timberland brands, is buying privately held streetwear company Supreme as it looks to grow its online and direct-to-consumer business. (AP Photo/Pablo Salinas)

V.F. Corp. estimates Supreme will rack up about $500 million in sales in its fiscal year ending January 2021. The brand has higher gross and operating profit margins than V.F. Corp’s overall portfolio, reflective of its focused business model and premium price-point products. The company thinks Supreme could reach $1 billion in sales over time as operations are expanded overseas (and likely, into more company-owned retail stores and high-end department stores).

V.F. dealmaking legacy persists

To long-time followers of V.F. Corp., doing big deals is the norm rather than exception. And it could be said the Supreme transaction was nicely telegraphed by Rendle throughout 2020.

Earlier this year, V.F. Corp. completed a $3 billion bond offering. That gave the company more than $5 billion in firepower (including a $2.2 billion unused credit line).

Rendle is no stranger to V.F. Corp.’s historically acquisitive nature, having joined the company in 1999 ahead of a major buying streak. In fact, buying well-known brands at a great value — and then scaling them up further globally — is a rite of passage of sorts for V.F. Corp. CEOs. Rendle’s predecessors Mackey McDonald and Eric Wiseman all had transformative acquisitions during their CEO tenures.

McDonald plunked down $396 million for skater lifestyle brand Vans in 2004 — the brand has since become a major growth driver worldwide. Wiseman purchased footwear maker Timberland for $2 billion in 2011 — performance has been spotty for the brand through the years, but it remains a household name and far better run under V.F. Corp’s ownership.

437,2020-11-09T23:17:16+00:00,V.F. Corp CEO: Why we bought Supreme for $2.1 billion,"V.F. Corp. (VFC) CEO Steve Rendle is taking his apparel giant to the Streets for its next leg of growth.

The owner of The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Dickies said Monday it will acquire Supreme for $2.1 billion.

Rendle tells Yahoo Finance the acquisition reflects his bullishness on streetwear longer-term, and Supreme’s leadership role in the space.

Supreme has made a name for itself since its founding in 1994 by offering high quality exclusive product drops. They tend to sell out quickly, which often leads to things like hoodies fetching over $1,000 on resale sites. The company has 12 retail stores and relies on digital for nearly 60% of its sales.

V.F. Corp. estimates Supreme will rack up about $500 million in sales in its fiscal year ending January 2021. The brand has higher gross and operating profit margins than V.F. Corp’s overall portfolio, reflective of its focused business model and premium price-point products. The company thinks Supreme could reach $1 billion in sales over time as operations are expanded overseas (and likely, into more company-owned retail stores and high-end department stores).

V.F. dealmaking legacy persists

To long-time followers of V.F. Corp., doing big deals is the norm rather than exception. And it could be said the Supreme transaction was nicely telegraphed by Rendle throughout 2020.

Earlier this year, V.F. Corp. completed a $3 billion bond offering. That gave the company more than $5 billion in firepower (including a $2.2 billion unused credit line).

Rendle is no stranger to V.F. Corp.’s historically acquisitive nature, having joined the company in 1999 ahead of a major buying streak. In fact, buying well-known brands at a great value — and then scaling them up further globally — is a rite of passage of sorts for V.F. Corp. CEOs. Rendle’s predecessors Mackey McDonald and Eric Wiseman all had transformative acquisitions during their CEO tenures.

McDonald plunked down $396 million for skater lifestyle brand Vans in 2004 — the brand has since become a major growth driver worldwide. Wiseman purchased footwear maker Timberland for $2 billion in 2011 — performance has been spotty for the brand through the years, but it remains a household name and far better run under V.F. Corp’s ownership.

438,2020-11-09T18:00:27+00:00,COVID-19 economy: Hostess sees jumbo donuts fly off the shelves as pandemic rages on,"The 2020 sweet treat snacking craze among quarantined U.S. consumers is showing no signs of letting up. In fact, it may be reaccelerating as people venture back indoors amid COVID-19 infections returning in force.

“We did see a [stock-up] surge during the pandemic, but what we have seen getting into phase two is more a continuation of maybe at a higher rate of continued behavior where consumers either look to treat or reward themselves and Hostess is a great option,” Hostess Brands CEO Andy Callahan said on Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re seeing that continue and actually accelerate with the number of households and in repeat purchases.”

Hostess Brands’ latest earnings report backs up those claims as products such as Jumbo Donettes and Cream Cheese Coffee Cakes appeared to fly off the shelves. Hostess is selling a lot of Twinkies during the pandemic.

Third-quarter sales rose 18.5% from the prior year to $260.9 million on the back of momentum for those aforementioned breakfast snacks. Adjusted operating profits increased 29.2% year-over-year to $60.2 million.

Executives told analysts on an earnings call that Hostess-branded breakfast sales have surged 14.3% over the past 13 weeks. Original Donette sales are up 14.5%, coffee cake sales are up 29.3% and single-serve Jumbo Donette sales have skyrocketed 45%.

Hostess is feeling so confident in the sustainability of the snacking craze — and full pipeline of innovation such as Super Grain Cookies — it announced a new $100 million stock buyback plan.

Says Callahan, “I don’t expect the indulgent trend to really slow down. It has been sustainable. It has been steady. It has happened before the pandemic. It has happened after the pandemic. So I don’t expect it to change. We’re not looking for over-indulgence. We are looking for an appropriate one occasion, reward yourself behavior as part of a balanced diet.”

439,2020-11-09T11:07:35+00:00,SoftBank Recovery Gains Ground With Vision Fund’s Record Profit,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is making his case for SoftBank Group Corp.’s turnaround.

The Japanese conglomerate reported a record 784.4 billion yen ($7.6 billion) profit in its Vision Fund business for the three months ended Sept. 30, a sign the fund’s investments in startups are paying off amid a broad rally in technology stocks. One Chinese startup quadrupled SoftBank’s money after going public in August.

Son also addressed nagging concerns about his stewardship. He revealed details about a controversial stock and options trading program, making clear the effort was relatively modest in scope and strategy. He even took steps to improve corporate governance by increasing the proportion of outside directors with the removal of four insiders, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure and Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra.

“Masa, myself, should be most supervised,” Son joked in a question and answer session after the results. “More external directors mean better governance.”

The Japanese billionaire took the stage at a briefing in Tokyo to explain how the company he founded four decades ago is coming back from record losses in the last fiscal year. The Vision Fund unit’s highest-ever profit cames as a global surge in technology shares lifted the value of stakes in public firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio. That helped the Tokyo-based company report net income of 627.5 billion yen for the quarter.

“The Vision Fund’s performance was very encouraging,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anthea Lai said. “They have pulled off a U-turn.”

The standout success for the quarter was a little-known Chinese startup called KE Holdings Inc. It runs an online property platform called Beike and its shares have surged since an initial public offering in August, handing SoftBank an unrealized gain of $5.1 billion on the investment for the quarter.

In his presentation, Son said his original $1.35 billion investment is now worth $7.9 billion because shares have kept surging since the end of September. Still, he said that after WeWork, another real estate bet that lost him billions, Beike “wasn’t very popular” at first.

Story continues

Son’s disclosures about his stock and options trading may ease the concerns of some investors who sold off SoftBank shares after initial reports about derivatives bets in September. The company said the fair value of its futures and options positions came to $2.7 billion at the end of September, including long call options on listed stocks worth $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks with negative $1.26 billion of value.

In response to media reports that SoftBank was the “Nasdaq whale” stoking the rally in tech stocks, Misra said publicly in October that SoftBank is “not even a dolphin, forget being a whale.”

Son explained that recent investments in securities and derivatives are experiments in how to put its cash to use now that the company is selling assets. He pointed out that the options account for just 1.2% of the company’s shareholdings.

That hasn’t stopped the skeptics.

“It’s still not clear why a company like SoftBank is dabbling in derivatives,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “There is a chance they are mistaking their initial success at the Vision Fund for skill instead of luck. Now they are trying to replicate that with the public funds division.”

SoftBank has also been putting capital into publicly traded stocks, part of an asset management effort revealed this year. It acquired 1.7 trillion yen of “highly liquid listed stocks” in the quarter, including a $6.3 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc., $2.2 billion in Facebook Inc. and $1.8 billion in Zoom Video Communications Inc. The operation is managed by its new subsidiary SB Northstar, in which Son personally holds a 33% stake.

SoftBank has typically made investments in private startups, giving funds to companies like Uber and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to help them grow. The founder argued his bets on public stocks are consistent because he’s backing more mature companies with advanced capabilities in areas like artificial intelligence.

“I can hear people saying, what’s he doing now investing in public companies,” Son said at the briefing. “These are investments in the AI revolution.”

Separately, Son announced the most substantial changes to his board in years, a move toward stronger governance practices supported by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. Four internal directors -- Claure, Misra, Chief Strategy Officer Katsunori Sago and Yasir Al-Rumayyan of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund -- have resigned. That increases the proportion of outside directors because the changes leave the board with four independent members out of nine.

SoftBank also said Chief Legal Officer Robert Townsend is leaving the company this month. The former co-chair of Morrison & Foerster’s Global M&A Practice Group joined SoftBank in August of 2018 to head its legal, compliance operations and corporate governance operations. Tim Mackey, who has served as deputy general counsel since November 2018, will take over from Townsend.

The departure comes after SoftBank has lost several top executives, including the COO of the Vision Fund. SoftBank’s Chief Compliance Officer Chad Fentress left the company in September and vacated his WeWork board seat.

Son has boosted his share price in part by selling off assets and buying back his own shares. After years of resisting, he’s sold stakes in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion.

The shift from running telecom and tech companies to investment management has left some investors and analysts perplexed.

“It’s becoming difficult to tell what SoftBank is all about anymore,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies. “While investors are always keen to hear about Son’s vision for the company, it seems to be changing every quarter. What people really want is more consistency.”

The billionaire argued that SoftBank is in fact very simple to understand: Investors should focus on a single metric -- net asset value, or the value of its shareholdings minus net debt. By that measure, the company is worth 27.3 trillion yen, a 5.6 trillion yen gain from half a year ago. SoftBank’s market capitalization was 14.8 trillion yen at the end of trading on Monday.

“What is SoftBank? It’s a company that invests in the information revolution,” Son said. “That hasn’t changed even for a day since I founded it.”

440,2020-11-09T01:39:46+00:00,375% Return on One Startup to Help SoftBank Get Past WeWork,"(Bloomberg) -- As Softbank Group Corp. tries to rebuild its reputation as a startup investor, the Japanese conglomerate will be able to point to several recent successes, including an obscure Chinese property startup that pulled off a blockbuster initial public offering.

SoftBank invested $1.35 billion last November in a Beijing-based company called KE Holdings Inc., which went public this August. Shares in the company, also known as Beike, soared from offering through Sept. 30 to lift the value of SoftBank’s reported stake to $6.4 billion, a 375% return. KE’s stock is up another 20% since the quarter’s close.

SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is certain to highlight such winners when he announces quarterly earnings results on Nov. 9. The Japanese billionaire scored hits early in his career by backing Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! Inc. But his reputation suffered from recent troubles at other startups, including the office-sharing firm WeWork, leading to record losses in the last fiscal year.

“SoftBank is recovering from the worst,” Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities Co. “Internet companies can lead to huge returns. It should be okay for SoftBank to find one company that will become like Alibaba in future.”

SoftBank shares rose as much as 5.2% on Monday and have gained almost 50% this year.

The KE investment, coupled with likely gains on several American tech giants, could help SoftBank surpass estimates for the second fiscal quarter. The company is expected to report 150.3 billion yen ($1.4 billion) of net income for the three months ended Sept. 30, according to the mean consensus by three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. It posted a 700 billion yen loss for the quarter a year earlier.

Estimating earnings for the company has grown increasingly difficult as it moved away from the predictable telecom industry into complex financial instruments. The firm said in August it will stop disclosing its operating income as it doesn’t reflect gains from its securities investments and dividend.

Story continues

In October, Son talked up Beike at SoftBank World, an event he holds annually to explain the company and its startups. He highlighted how the company uses artificial intelligence to match buyers and sellers in the Chinese property market.

“It is an awesome firm,” Son said, showing graphics to detail the company’s business. “It’s growing rapidly and posting huge profits already.”

SoftBank has engineered a comeback this year after missteps with startups like WeWork and concerns about fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. It unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen in assets and buy back a record 2.5 trillion yen of its own stock, pushing shares to a two-decade high in October.

The IPO market has also improved, opening the door for SoftBank portfolio companies to go public. ByteDance Ltd., the developer of the TikTok app and backed by Son, is considering a listing in Hong Kong, Bloomberg News reported. Even WeWork expects to revisit plans for an IPO after its disastrous attempt in 2019.

“With investors getting used to the COVID-19 pandemic, unicorn stocks are appreciating,” Yoshio Ando, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co., said in a report dated Oct. 26. “We expect Softbank Group’s profile to change dramatically this year. We look to the firm to navigate its way through a world unknown to investors.”

SoftBank also benefited from the Nasdaq’s strong third quarter. If it held its stakes in Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and 23 other U.S. firms disclosed in U.S. securities filings for the period, its paper gain would be about $570 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg. The return for those securities was 15%, compared with 11% for the index.

Son has increasingly discouraged investors and analysts from focusing on quarterly profit -- one of the reasons he eliminated the disclosure of operating income. While profit was a reasonable indicator of performance when SoftBank was primarily a telecom operator, it’s less relevant as the company has evolved into an investment holding company, he has said.

Accounting rules mean that investment gains or losses are treated differently on SoftBank’s income statements if they come from the Vision Fund or the parent company -- even though the effect on the company is essentially the same. He would prefer investors focus on the value of SoftBank’s holdings, like its stakes in Alibaba and KE Holdings, rather than net income.

“What is more important is the shareholder value,” he said on the earnings call in August.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned how you're changing the business this year, and of course, that brings us directly to COVID, because that's accelerating the change or informing how you're changing as well. And of course, you guys got hit big time like all the other retailers, and now you've been coming back. Talk about that whole process, Michelle, and how that's going right now.

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah. Andy, it's hard to imagine that was just seven or eight months ago that all of this happened and, you know, has changed the world as we know it. And for retailers like Kohl's, even more significant of an impact, because we did our part in helping to slow the virus, and we'll continue to do that. But our stores ended up being closed, the entire fleet, for seven weeks and, you know, some parts of our business closed for up to 17 weeks.

You know, that process, if I go back in time, and what that was like-- you know, it's interesting, Andy, March was going to be the time where we unveiled to our investors what our new direction of the company was. That literally was planned for March 16. And it was up until that week before that we were getting ready to-- it had already moved from in-person to a webcast, but literally days before, where we saw the dramatic acceleration of what COVID was doing to society at large.

And so, literally in a matter of days, we decided to postpone our investor day. And on that day, specifically, March 16-- that's a day I'll never forget-- we were huddled, my leadership team and I huddled around a table in a conference room, figuring out and trying to interpret all the signals of what was happening in the country and in the world and how we were going to get through this period, with recognizing that 75% of our business, at some point, was probably going to be closed given all the unknowns around the virus.

Story continues

So we set out two key priorities, which is first and foremost, doing our part to protect the safety of our people and our customers, and secondly, to ensure our financial viability and resilience through this process. So instead of being up in front of investors, we were figuring out what we needed to do to, like I say, put new procedures in place in our stores, assuming one day they'd be reopened, and of course, they were.

But then the financial decisions around reducing expenses and ensuring we had the adequate liquidity, so upsizing our revolver, you know, getting more capital from the markets, et cetera. And it was great to be on the other side. And our balance sheet-- we entered this period with a strong balance sheet, and it continues to be the case today. And I would say once we did get back our stores up and running, obviously our liquidity dramatically improved, and we have now paid back that full $1.5 billion revolver.

But that period of time, it was really a defining moment for the company and the team on how we so quickly could galvanize, do the right thing, in our-- like I said, our role for the greater good, the right thing for our people, but make really tough, tough decisions, unimaginable decisions that I never thought I would face to get through that period.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/kohl-made-unimaginable-decisions-coronavirus-140000046.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IBUY.US', 'JWN.US', 'KSS.US', 'M.US', 'ROST.US', 'SPXL.US', 'SPXS.US', 'TGT.US', 'TJX.US', 'UVXY.US', 'WMT.US', 'XRT.US']",['COVID'],"{'polarity': 0.993, 'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.092}"

Video Transcript

- Tell us about the relationship with Amazon now, and are they a friend or a frenemy? Or how does that whole relationship work?

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah. I would definitely put them in the friend category. You know, when we created this relationship a few years ago and started testing-- and I can describe that in a moment-- it definitely got a few questions, like, wait a minute, aren't you aren't you competing with Amazon? Of course, I would say there's plenty of market share to be had, right. There's billions of in the kinds of products we sell.

But a few years ago, I mean, we're looking at the incredible company. They were building the tailwind they had and we have assets they have and they have assets we don't have. We get the store base I keep talking about. Healthy, robust. And another comment to our earlier discussion-- the future of brick and mortar-- it's not just about transacting and buying product. As I mentioned, we're using them to fulfill goods. So they're a omnichannel fulfillment center as well.

And so we've really challenge ourselves to think creatively about all the ways that this physical space can be used and serve our families. So a few years ago, we connected with Amazon and talked about lots of ideas, actually, on how we could bring our complementary strengths. We've got this incredible store base and this consumer base, they have this tremendous reach and loyalty. Is there a win-win in here, and can we think differently and build on each other's strengths?

And so we started testing this idea where, at the core of it, we accept Amazon returns. And one of the insights we have about our customers, Andy, and we knew this from our own experience, customers hate dealing with returns. Packaging up, finding the packing slip, dealing with it, and we have already seen that 90% of our returns happen in the store. So how could we extend that and have that really be a skill of the company that we can leverage into other spaces? And Amazon didn't have the convenience of these 1,200 stores that we offer.

So the service in a nutshell is we take Amazon returns and we make it really easy for the customer. We have a dedicated space. It takes literally seconds to process the return. The big advantage? It's free and the customer doesn't have to pack to that. So literally, they can just walk in with whatever item that maybe they changed their mind on and bring it to Kohl's they're done. And what we get is we get new traffic, and importantly, building a relationship with some new customers. And what we're finding is we are getting new customers and we're seeing a younger customer and those are both very strategically important to us.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-friend-department-store-giant-140000148.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'BABA.US', 'BABAF.US', 'BBY.US', 'EMQQ.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IBUY.US', 'JWN.US', 'KSS.US', 'M.US', 'QQQ.US', 'RETL.US', 'ROST.US', 'SPXL.US', 'SPXS.US', 'TGT.US', 'UVXY.US', 'W.US', 'WMT.US', 'XRT.US']","['AMAZON', 'AMAZON RETURNS']","{'polarity': 0.996, 'neg': 0.007, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.154}"

446,2020-11-06T01:58:12+00:00,Alibaba’s Slowing Sales Spook Investors On Edge Over Ant,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s revenue grew at its slowest pace on record for a September quarter, underscoring how the e-commerce giant’s post-pandemic rebound is starting to plateau.

Asia’s largest corporation reported a 30% rise in sales in the September quarter, in line with expectations but down a tad from the previous three months. That did little to reassure investors worried about the tightening regulatory scrutiny that forced Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. to call off its $35 billion IPO. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang would only say it’s evaluating the impact on its business from more stringent rules governing its 32%-owned sister company.

Alibaba’s shares sank as much as 4.3% in early Hong Kong trading, extending a volatile streak that began with a selloff of more than $60 billion earlier this week. The company enjoys a close relationship with Ant, whose Alipay mobile wallet anchors the majority of Alibaba’s e-commerce transactions and whose microlending services drive consumption. In response to a question about the extent to which Ant loans lead to online shopping, executives said the company doesn’t quantify that traffic.

“As Ant Group’s major shareholder, Alibaba is actively evaluating the impact on our business in response to the recently proposed changes in the fintech regulatory environment, and will take appropriate measures accordingly,” Zhang told analysts on a conference call.

Alibaba booked almost 4.7 billion yuan of profit from Ant in the September quarter, a big chunk of its overall bottom line. The e-commerce giant reported revenue for the three months ended September of 155.1 billion yuan ($23.4 billion), meeting the 154.8 billion yuan average of estimates. Profit fell 60% to 28.8 billion yuan from a year earlier, when it booked a one-time gain from the acquisition of its stake in Ant.

Alibaba had benefited from stronger sales in its home market, which had led the global recovery from Covid-19. Gross domestic product grew 4.9% last quarter, making China the world’s only major growth engine. The e-commerce titan is banking on more than a quarter of a million brands, increased discounting and technologies like livestreamed selling to draw consumers to its annual blockbuster Single’s Day shopping festival, which culminates next week.

Story continues

“The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch. “E-commerce is the only sector that will actually benefit from coronavirus, simply due to the fact that a lot of normal consumption is shifted from offline to online.”

Alibaba’s shares have gained more than 60% from their Covid-19-era lows in March and touched a record high in October when Ant priced its IPO. Retail and institutional investors had flocked to the record $35 billion-plus IPO, betting that Ant will overcome high valuations, regulatory headwinds and rising competition to reshape the future of global finance.

Excluding the Covid-hit March quarter, the 29% increase in Alibaba’s core commerce business was the slowest in more than five years as consumers put off purchases ahead of Single’s Day. The closely watched customer management revenue for China commerce rose 20% in the quarter. Core commerce should expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23% from 2021 to 2023, CGS-CIMB analysts including Lei Yang wrote.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Alibaba may continue to benefit from accelerated user and merchant adoption of online grocery shopping, cloud computing and remote-work applications, driven by China’s Covid-19 outbreak. Its domestic retail marketplaces have fully recovered from the pandemic. Longer-term sales and profit growth could be driven by global expansion and the monetization of newer business segments such as logistics, media and entertainment.

Revenue for Alibaba’s cloud division jumped 60% in the quarter, driven by demand from customers in the internet, finance and retail industries. The unit is forecast to turn profitable for the first time ever in the year ending March, a target that was reiterated by Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu on Thursday. That will be a milestone for the decade-old business, which competes with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp. and Google globally and is fending off upstarts like Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home.

Alibaba is keeping up a steady pace of acquisitions to drive growth. The company teamed up with Richemont to jointly invest $1.1 billion in luxury e-commerce retailer Farfetch Ltd. to tap on the burgeoning demand for highend foreign goods among China’s middle class, according to a statement Thursday. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday the country may import more than $22 trillion worth of products over the next decade.

In October, Alibaba also agreed to take a stake in Swiss duty-free giant Dufry AG, a move that Zhang said would be a “very important step” in helping the company grow its retail travel business as China develops domestic free trade ports. And to capitalize on the boom in online groceries, it last month paid about $3.6 billion to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., taking control of one of China’s largest hypermarts to try and fend off rivals like JD.com Inc., upstart Pinduoduo Inc. and Tencent-backed Meituan.

448,2020-11-05T14:00:00+00:00,Influencers with Andy Serwer: Michelle Gass,"In this episode of Influencers, Andy speaks with Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass about the state of the retail industry, how Kohl's plans to survive the pandemic, and the company's strategic partnership with Amazon.

Video Transcript

- They said the pandemic was the final nail in the coffin for brick and mortar retailers. Many closed their doors for good. Others filed for bankruptcy. But in the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.

Michelle Gass first joined Kohl's more than seven years ago, signing on as the company's first chief customer officer, and quickly rising up the ranks until 2018 when she was named the company's CEO. Now Gass is leading Kohl's through the most challenging period in the company's history.

She's betting big on strategic new partnerships and has outlined a new plan to navigate the COVID crisis. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Michelle Gass about the future of e-commerce, teaming up with one of the world's largest retailers, and why she says the coronavirus presents a unique opportunity for Kohl's.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Michelle Gass, the CEO of Kohl's. Michelle, nice to see you.

MICHELLE GASS: It's good to see you, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So you're at headquarters up in Wisconsin, right?

MICHELLE GASS: I am-- Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.

ANDY SERWER: So I want to talk to you about everything that's going on. First of all, let's talk a little bit about Kohl's. Because everyone knows what Kohl's is, one of the largest stores in the United States. But they might not really understand-- well, niche is maybe not the right word 'cause you're so big, but what space you guys fill. What is Kohl's exactly, then, Michelle?

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah. Well, to your point, Andy, let me just talk about Kohl's, our company, and our brand; and then talk about the exciting pivot that we're making as a business. So first of all, as you said, I hope everybody knows Kohl's. But we do serve American families literally coast to coast. We're in 49 states.

Story continues

We serve about 65 million customers. One out of every two American households actually shop Kohl's. We have a very big loyalty program, about 30 million members. And a fun stat that we like to share is that 80% of Americans live within 15 miles of a Kohl's. And that's within our store fleet. So we have close to 1,200 stores.

But we also have a growing e-commerce business that last year penetrated about 25% of our business. Obviously in this time, it's penetrating a lot more. But it has been a terrific growth engine for the company.

Historically, Andy, to your question-- well first of all, I would say from the very beginning and the heritage of the company, we've been all about families. So we serve families, diverse families. And we're all about meeting their needs.

And we have a great purpose statement. We're very much a purpose-driven company. And our purpose is to inspire and empower families to lead more fulfilled lives. And that's true to the DNA. And so we sell lots of categories to accomplish that.

But we are very customer-oriented. I mean, we put our people and our customers at the center of everything we do. And customer needs and family needs have been changing. They've been changing over the last few years. And that's accelerated during this time, this period of COVID.

And so I'm sure we'll talk more about this. But the punch line for Kohl's is that we are gonna be evolving our business and our brand to stand much more for the active and casual lifestyle and how American families are living today.

ANDY SERWER: And I want to talk more about that. And indeed, Michelle, you're right. First of all, we talked a little while ago, a few months ago. And I said you were a department store. And you said, well not really. So why ""not really""? What's different from you versus a traditional department store for instance?

MICHELLE GASS: It's a great question, Andy. So even in our prior chapters of the company, we've been very different than a department store. First, I would say, our locations. So 95% of our stores are off-mall. And typically you think about a department store as an anchor to a mall.

And right from the very beginning, that construct of the business was to make ourselves really convenient to our families. So easy access, in and out, hence the 95% off-mall presence. And even the store design and layout-- it's very atypical than what you might think of a department store.

So we call it the racetrack design. So you can come in our stores and you can spend as much or as little time as you want, with a really easy navigation path. And on all our registers are at the front of the store, again, speaking to that convenience. I think where we're going, Andy, is even further separation.

So I'd say one, just everything we've done and invested in from an omnichannel standpoint-- so operating our store fleets, having this important digital business, and then how we bring those things together. A lot of that over the last couple of years has been more back-of-house; so fulfilling orders from something we call ship-from-store.

So we take advantage of the inventory in our stores. And we get it to the customer faster if the pair of jeans they're looking to order is actually in their local store maybe. Versus one of our e-commerce fulfillment centers. But more and more, the thing I get excited about is how easy we're making it for customers to order online and then come in, either pick it up in the store-- we've had that service for a couple years, or now our newly introduced curbside pick-up.

And that really plays back into the convenience. We have special parking. So literally they can come in, park special to go in and get their buy-online pick-up in store, or now just drive their car right up to the curb. So that convenience factor, I think, has always distinguished us from the, call it, traditional department store.

Now we're making this move, as I said, to really redefine ourselves as much more of-- I describe a specialty concept, a specialty store-- a lifestyle retailer, candidly, serving the family for all of their active and casual needs across everything. One might think, apparel. And there's many successful players in that space. And that business is growing. That category's growing.

Yes, and we sell a lot of active and casual apparel. But there's footwear. And even meeting the needs of a healthy lifestyle is about home and healthy cooking and things like healthy sleep. And we're all looking for a little more of that these days.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. And I want to talk a little bit more about that, and also your partnership with Amazon. But you mentioned how you're changing the business this year. And of course that brings us directly to COVID, because that's accelerating the change or informing how you're changing as well.

And of course, you guys got hit big-time, like all the other retailers. And now you've been coming back. Talk about that whole process, Michelle, and how that's going right now.

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah, Andy, it's hard to imagine that was just 7 or 8 months ago that all of this happened and has changed the world as we know it. And for retailers like Kohl's, even more significant of an impact-- because we did our part in helping to slow the virus. And we'll continue to do that.

But our stores ended up being closed, the entire fleet, for 7 weeks. And some parts of our business closed for up to 17 weeks. That process, if I go back in time and what that was like, it's interesting, Andy. March was gonna be the time where we unveiled to our investors what our new direction of the company was. That literally was planned for March 16. And it was up until that week before that we were getting ready to.

It had already moved from in-person to a webcast, but literally days before, where we saw the dramatic acceleration of what COVID was doing to society at large. And so literally in a matter of days we decided to postpone our investor day. And on that day specifically, March 16-- that's a day I'll never forget.

My leadership team and I huddled around a table in a conference room figuring out and trying to interpret all the signals of what was happening in the country and in the world and how we were going to get through this period; with recognizing that 75% of our business, at some point, was probably going to be closed given all the unknowns around the virus.

So we set out two key priorities, which is first and foremost, doing our part to protect the safety of our people and our customers. And secondly to ensure our financial viability and resilience through this process. So instead of being up in front of investors, we were figuring out what we needed to do to, like I say, put new procedures in place in our stores-- assuming one day they'd be reopened. And of course, they were.

But then the financial decisions around reducing expenses and ensuring we had the adequate liquidity-- so upsizing our revolver, getting more capital from the markets, et cetera. And it was great to be on the other side. And our balance sheet-- we entered this period with a strong balance sheet. And it continues to be the case today.

And I would say, once we did get back our stores up and running, obviously our liquidity dramatically improved. And we have now paid back that full $1.5 billion revolver. But that period of time, it was really a defining moment for the company and the team on how we so quickly could galvanize; do the right thing in, like I said, our role for the greater good; the right thing for our people; but make really tough, tough decisions-- unimaginable decisions that I never thought I would face to get through that period.

ANDY SERWER: And yet the problem, Michelle, for you and for so many other leaders though is that you guys weathered this storm, but now it appears like COVID is coming back. And these cases are rising in nearly every state. They're rising in your home state of Wisconsin of course.

So how are you now navigating this latest wrinkle? And what's the latest in terms of managing through this ongoing crisis I guess? It's not really over necessarily.

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah, it's certainly not over. And, Andy, I think you're looking at the same data I am. And we're gonna to be in this for a while. I think that first chapter for us was we were all facing something we had never faced before. And there was so much uncertainty on every level.

But when we did close down and made sure we had the liquidity and, like I said, did everything we needed to do for our associates-- I mean, we still had associates working. We have a big e-commerce business. And our e-fulfillment centers were very busy. And we were fulfilling orders even from the store; but I think importantly, recognizing even then that we were gonna be in this for a while, putting new processes and procedures in place for our stores to operate in this environment, but very differently.

So I'd say the good thing for Kohl's is we already have big stores. They're spacious, sort of built for social distancing from the beginning. But we set out to be best in class in operating our stores safely. So there was no stone unturned from the obvious things, like lots of sanitizer and the plexies and everything that people are doing; but investing more in labor, and putting a greeter at the front to wipe down carts; ensuring that our pin pads and our registers were wiped down after every customer interaction.

And some of the big moves, frankly, were removing merchandise from the store. And as a retailer, you never do that right? But we actually cleared out-- I mentioned that racetrack-- cleared out that racetrack of any impulse items, opened up the floor. What we're actually finding, Andy, is it's delivering a better customer experience.

So we're actually not going back. And even reducing our inventory as dramatically as we did, not knowing how long we were gonna close, and then what the rebound was gonna be like, we're seeing good results out of that; driving faster inventory turn.

But all that being said, I do feel very confident that we are operating in a different, better, safer way today. Even COVID cases are increasing. But the team's all over it.

And what's a really important data point for me is we're regularly serving our customers. And we get very high marks. They feel very comfortable shopping in our store. They feel safe.

And we're continuing to see that even with cases rising. There's still a need for people to, or a want, for people to come to Kohl's. And while in the early stage of this we were deemed nonessential, we're viewed pretty essential to a lot of our customers.

ANDY SERWER: And who do you talk to to get information and stay informed and get guidance? Do you talk to the governor? Or do you talk to Washington? Do you talk to scientists, board members? How does that work?

MICHELLE GASS: Well, all of the above-- all of the above. I think one of the great silver linings through this is how the industry has come together to be as informed as possible. So I'm part of several industry associations, as you would imagine. And these groups are holding-- in the core of the early chapters of this, we were on calls twice a week, during the week, on the weekend.

They were bringing in many experts from, to your point, the scientists to government officials-- everything in between, state level, federal level. So we would always have the latest information of what was going on. And then I think it's just been incredible with the openness across what would be traditionally competitors; that we were just completely open around best practices we were putting in place, for example, on the safety front.

Because our view is, hey, we're all gonna win together here. We want to create a safe retail environment more broadly. It's not just about Kohl's at this point.

It's how do we do our part together as an industry to have people feel comfortable being out again? Again, our consumers are living in such an uncertain environment, how can we reassure them? And we were better together on that front.

But it's an ongoing piece. Maybe, Andy, we were meeting twice a week in the early parts of this. I'm still on at least weekly calls across multiple fronts. Some are industry. Some are just big forums with CEOs from across many industries, tapping into the expertise amongst our community, but importantly bringing in the subject matter experts. That's been critical, absolutely critical to me.

ANDY SERWER: Fascinating. So you were talking to people at Target and Walmart and other big chains like that as well; and CVS or companies with [AUDIO OUT].

MICHELLE GASS: They were all on multiple calls that I was on, yes. And there were [AUDIO OUT]. I would say I great input from grocers, who were just open this whole time, and looking at the best practices that they had put in place. A lot of those applied right to Kohl's.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

MICHELLE GASS: And it felt good we were ahead of it. I mean, even before we closed our stores-- and I'll never forget that day either. We shut the door the evening of March 19. Even before that happened, we were already making the changes and ordering plexi-glasses. I myself, Andy was, believe it or not, going to local stores and seeing how those plexies were set up.

'Cause I just wanted to make sure, as made the move-- this was not a check-the-box. We really needed to keep our customers safe, and importantly, our people safe. Because that was also another factor. I mean, we employ close to 100,000 people across our distribution centers and our stores.

And we did-- by the way, Andy, make a difficult decision a few weeks into closing our stores. We had to furlough these associates. So bringing them back, we needed to make sure they were safe and they felt safe. And our return rate was very, very strong.

And on that front too, we're just such a purpose- and culture-driven company, even while these associates were furloughed-- well, we want to make sure that they would want to come back, feel welcome back. We maintained their health benefits. And all the communication I did, they continued to get that. They were still part of the team. So that safety piece and the best practice sharing and benchmarking has been instrumental, and continues to be, as we sit here today.

ANDY SERWER: Let's talk a little bit about the economy, Michelle, and specifically the need for a stimulus package-- another one. And obviously that's been all blocked up in Washington. Do you think that we need another stimulus?

And should that even included a bailout for some retailers? I mean, some people have suggested that Penney's and Macy's should get moneys directly. What's your thought on that?

MICHELLE GASS: I guess my thought overarching on this is I want the consumer to be as healthy as they can be. And there are many ways to accomplish that objective. Ideally we have people working and it's safe. But we need to make sure this virus is under control as well.

Clearly when the first stimulus package was passed, you could see it. It impacted consumers. And it gave them the safety net they needed. So I'm just a big fan of whatever we need to do to help the economy and our customers come out the other side of this.

And I'd say, for Kohl's, Andy, on this-- again, we are fortunate that we entered this period as a strong, resilient company and retailer. But then we had to make some really tough, decisive, quick actions to make sure that we maintained that position. And we did.

But there is gonna be some marketplace disruption through all of this. And we've all been seeing that. And from a Kohl's standpoint, I think ultimately there'll be an opportunity for us to capture market share. I mean, it has been painful as someone part of this industry to see what has happened. I would never wish negative things to happen to these companies or importantly the people who have had livelihoods there.

But there is a practical reality to some of this happening. And I look at it from a standpoint of the market share is gonna go somewhere. And I think we have a great concept. As I said, we're evolving who we are to be more relevant. And we have great associates to serve and welcome these customers. So we'll be there for our customers.

And to the health of the consumer, I mean, I think the good thing for Kohl's is part of our DNA is we're about great value. And whether it's how we price our goods or our loyalty program, we're in a good position to serve customers wherever they are on their financial spectrum.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you still do have this wind in your face, Michelle, with-- people talk about the retail apocalypse. And even leaving COVID aside, of course there's just this great sea change in retailing. Of course it's all about digital.

We'll talk about your relationship with Amazon in a second. But I'm just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of the place for brick and mortar in this new reality, maybe post-COVID even. What will it take to succeed as a as a physical store?

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah, that's a great question. It's a big question. I mean, clearly COVID has dramatically accelerated digital adoption. I mean, some would say five-plus years what it typically would have taken across all demographics. And we're always gonna go where the customer is. So we're leaning into that.

I think the power of Kohl's is really about this omnichannel force like I spoke about; so how we can link the digital acceleration with our strong stores. But we're starting from a very good place, Andy. So to your point, you do see what's happening. You see brick and mortar closing.

There's been numbers thrown out there, like, 20,000 stores even this year are gonna be closed. We have close to 1,200 stores. And they're healthy. So 99% of them are cash flow positive. 90% of them are generating over a million dollars of cash. And so every time I look at this, it's like-- no, we're starting from an incredible place. We are always rigorously evaluating our stores.

But an important factor that I think isn't spoken enough about is that where we have a store, our digital sales around the store actually increase. So it's the brand relevance. I have complete confidence and conviction that even in this digital acceleration, there's gonna be a role for stores.

The day we opened our doors back, I mean, we had a line of people anxious to come in. Now, yes, they're seeing plexies. Our associates are in masks. They're coming in in masks. But they want to get out of the house. They want to engage.

They want to discover product. And discovering product online is different than discovering product in a store where you can see something, and it captures your attention or your imagination. But I do think the bar has been raised for how a brick and mortar operator performs how they operate.

And clearly there's a new safety protocol. You've got to measure up and ideally exceed the customer's expectation. That's not gonna go away, even in a year's time. And I think that's gonna have a long tail to it, perhaps permanently. And then if someone's making a decision to come to the store, you better be on your A-game; so the products you sell being even more curated on what you're offering-- both offering that dependability, but also importantly that discovery.

But customers, like I said, there's still a human need to want to get out of your house and engage. And there are different ways to do that. But shopping, that's sort of core to society. And so I'm looking forward to continuing to be one of those choices as we look forward.

ANDY SERWER: Tell us about the relationship with Amazon now. And are they a friend or a frenemy? How does that whole relationship work?

MICHELLE GASS: I would definitely put them in the friend category. When we created this relationship a few years ago and started testing, and I can describe that in a moment, it definitely got a few questions. Like, ""wait a minute, aren't you competing with Amazon?"" Of course, I would say, there's plenty of market share to be had. There's billions of dollars in the kinds of products we sell.

But a few years ago, we were looking at the incredible company they were building, the tailwind they had. And we have assets. They have many assets we don't have. I mean, we get the store base I keep talking about-- healthy, robust.

And another comment to our earlier discussion, the future of brick and mortar, it's not just about transacting and buying product. As I mentioned, we're using them to fulfill goods. So they're an omnichannel fulfillment center as well. And so we've really challenge ourselves to think creatively about all the ways that this physical space can be used and serve our families.

So a few years ago we connected with Amazon and talked about lots of ideas, actually, on how we could bring our complementary strengths. We've got this incredible store base and this consumer base. They have this tremendous reach and loyalty. Is there a win-win in here? And can we think differently and build on each other's strengths?

And so we started testing this idea where at the core of it we accept Amazon returns. And one of the insights we have about our customers, Andy, is that-- and we knew this from our own experience. Customers hate dealing with returns; packaging up, finding the packing slip, dealing with it.

And we have already seen that 90% of our returns happen in the store. So how could we extend that and have that really be a skill of the company that we can leverage into other spaces? And Amazon didn't have the convenience of these 1,200 stores that we offer.

So the service in a nutshell is we take Amazon returns, and we make it really easier for the customer. We have a dedicated space. It takes literally seconds to process the return. The big advantage, it's free and the customer doesn't have to package it up. So literally they can just walk in with whatever item that maybe they changed their mind on and bring it to Kohl's and they're done.

And what we get is we get new traffic and importantly building a relationship with some new customers. And what we're finding is we are getting new customers. And we're seeing a younger customer. And those are both very strategically important to us.

ANDY SERWER: And where could you take this relationship? And I mean, are you starting to track customer data with Amazon, which Amazon is so good at? And some people raise their eyebrows about that of course. But how much further could this go?

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah. They've been-- I can't say [AUDIO OUT]. They've been a great partner to us. And we compare notes on the service. We're just rounding our one-year anniversary of having taken this across the country to all of our stores.

We studied it in pilots before we went live. And it's working for them. Again, they're delivering a seamless experience to their customers. We're seeing the traffic. And there's more things we can do. A lot of those things I can't talk about right now. But we're trying out different ways to better serve the customer within this experience.

You may have heard about a pilot we're doing where-- we have this initiative, Andy, called right-sizing. Which, basically, we look at some of their stores. Our stores average about 90,000 square feet. And we have about 20 stores where we are in essence shrinking our store to go from 90,000 to say 60,000, and then bringing in a tenant next to us.

So we've done that with grocery stores. We've done it with some fitness concepts. And we are building out an Amazon-- or they're building an Amazon grocery concept that will be adjacent to a Kohl's. Will it work or not? We'll see. It has to work for both of us.

But I think it really speaks to the spirit of the partnership in trying this. And more importantly, and something that I was focused on pre-COVID, and more so even during COVID and well beyond is Kohl's being obsessive about experimentation and trying things. And we have lots of those going on right now in the speed and the agility.

I mean, I mentioned curbside. That's been done by many companies and brands, especially grocery stores, for years-- not so much in our space. We stood that up in two weeks, literally two weeks after we closed our stores.

We're trying out a new concept, it's going up this week, called the Wellness Market-- consistent with this vision of active and casual and wellness, where we're gonna be selling categories of personal care or home cleaning. We typically have not been in those categories.

We're gonna try it in 50 stores. It may or may not work. But I think it just speaks to the agility of the team to be willing to take measured risks and see what works. And there's gonna be hopefully some big things that work. And some things that don't, and we'll close them down.

ANDY SERWER: Gotta keep pushing out.

MICHELLE GASS: Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: I want to shift gears a little bit and ask about your background. You are from Maine?

MICHELLE GASS: Indeed, I am from Maine, yes. [AUDIO OUT]

ANDY SERWER: WPI [AUDIO OUT]. Studied chemical engineering. I think, there. So how did all that being a New Englander prepare you to run this company? We'll talk about Starbucks in a second. Was that a background that helps you out right now?

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah. So it's a great question. I grew up in Maine. I went to school in Massachusetts. And I ended up at Procter & Gamble my first job out of chemical engineering. I ultimately did get my MBA at University of Washington, when we had moved to Seattle at some chapter later.

But I am a big believer in having either technical or mathematical skills as a core part of your background. And I'd say with an engineering background, that's all about problem-solving. So I learned at P&G that maybe I was less passionate about chemical problems.

But I was much more passionate about solving problems for the consumer and that level, that sense of innovation. But I think, again, the engineering mind is about looking at opportunities of problems from multiple angles and driving innovation and new thinking. And so now I get to do that in amazing ways. And I have, over now decades of my career-- just thinking about how to innovate; how to zig when others are zagging; how to surprise and look for those ways to be one step ahead of where the consumer's going.

ANDY SERWER: And you had a great run at Starbucks, help put the frappuccino on the map and worked with Howard Schultz for quite some time. What was that experience like, Michelle? And what did you learn there?

MICHELLE GASS: Boy, well, I was there close to 17 years, Andy. So hard in a quick answer to answer that. I mean, I think that experience defines who I am today. I learned so much during that period on so many levels, from incredible leaders and mentors like Howard Schultz and others there.

I think first of all, it's putting the customer and your employees at the center of everything you do. And Starbucks was phenomenal with that. And frankly, one of the reasons I came to Kohl's is I saw that as well. At the core of the Kohl's culture and value, they shared that; that passion and importance around their employees and our customers.

The spirit of innovation and entrepreneurialism, again, that has been a hallmark at Starbucks from the very beginning and continues. And they have extraordinary success. And so during all my time there, whether it was leading new beverage innovations or food or having tremendous opportunity and worked overseas in Europe, that the company really rewards, embraces disruptive thinking and innovation.

And so it's been great to further foster that here in this environment. And then, like I said, I'll just end on the culture. And it's just really important to do all those things to foster an environment so that people can come to work and be their best selves, be their authentic selves. And that's really important to me.

And I've never seen it so critical than during a crisis and during COVID where I'm responsible for 100,000 people. And when we were in the state of so much uncertainty, it was really important for me to show up as a leader; drive that clarity and that comfort.

I did weekly video outreaches to every associate so that they could kind of say, ""OK, I don't know what's spinning around me. But I can look up. I can see my leader. I can see the leadership team. And they may not have all the answers. But they have my back."" And I think that's critically important. And again, all these aspects-- putting the customer at the center, the role of the employee culture and that innovation, those are values I live by very much today.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of values, I want to ask you about diversity and inclusiveness. And there's a lot of work for corporate America to do here. Only 10% of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women, point one.

And point two, workplaces in the C-suite are not nearly diverse enough. And so there's work to be done. I'm sure you agree. And I'm wondering what you're doing to make that happen at Kohl's, at the very least, Michelle.

MICHELLE GASS: Yeah, Andy, it's a really, really important point. And our work will never be done here. And myself, like many other leaders as you point out, I'm so happy and impressed with how CEOs across the country and the world are upping our game on our role in building diverse and inclusive environments for our companies and frankly even doing more than that.

So we have a very ambitious diversity strategy. And we have, over the last year, set up a task force. I personally chair that. And we're looking at diversity and inclusion from its broadest sense. So our strategy is simple. But there's lots of layers to it. Which, we're focused on the diversity and inclusion of our people, for our customers, and for the communities we serve.

As it relates to people, if I look at the overall associate base of Kohl's-- all those 100,000 people, we actually look pretty good. We look like most of America. To your point, when I look at our top leaders, our directors and above, we need to do better. And so we are doing lots of things to impact that at all levels-- from a recruiting standpoint in where we're recruiting, from our retention, from an engagement.

We have what we call business resource groups. Or some call it employee resource groups. We have nine of them that all focus on different aspects of this. So there's not one moment in any of my monthly videos or town halls that I'm not talking about the importance of diversity and holding ourselves, as leaders, accountable.

We need to make much greater progress around people of color, and even on women. I'm proud to be a female CEO. There's not enough of us. One detail too is that my CFO is a woman too. So we're a CEO/CFO female pair. And there's not that many of those either.

Our customers-- we need to be more relevant to a diverse base of customers. We have tremendous opportunity there to serve our customers more effectively. And I believe doing the right thing can also lead to great results. And as we do that, that will also enhance our results.

And then lastly community-- one of the biggest things we can do, Andy, is impact our supplier base. And so we're putting goals around how we're gonna grow our supplier base to have a much more diverse set of suppliers and make an impact there too.

ANDY SERWER: All right. Well, certainly a lot of work for you to do, Michelle. Thank you so much for your time. Michelle Gass, the CEO of Kohl's, thanks a lot.

MICHELLE GASS: Thank you, Andy. Take care.

449,2020-11-02T23:00:04+00:00,Ambani Versus Bezos: A Fight or a Waiting Game?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A vanilla commercial dispute is setting the stage for a clash between the world’s No. 1 and No. 6 richest men. But the legal wrangling is a sideshow. What Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani are really fighting over is pole position in the only billion-plus-people consumer market available to both of them: India.

The ostensible battleground is a $3.4 billion deal Indian tycoon Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. stitched up in August to acquire assets of debt-laden local retailer Future Group. Bezos’s Amazon.com Inc. is trying to block the transaction.

That, in itself, is a bit of a dampener. Expectations were building for the two billionaires to work together. In September, Bloomberg News reported that Ambani had given Amazon an option to buy as much as 40% of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd., seeking to repeat the success he had earlier this year in bringing in Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. as partners to his digital platform.

By seeking to stall Ambani’s purchase of Future, Bezos may be signaling that he would rather remain a rival. Or, that he’s buying time to sweeten the offer currently on the table.

The actual quarrel is only interesting when you read between the lines of the claims and counterclaims.Amazon bought a 49% stake last year in a private firm controlled by Kishore Biyani, a pioneer of modern-format retailing in the country. The investment gave the U.S. e-commerce giant the right to acquire Biyani’s shares in the publicly traded Future Retail Ltd. from the third year. Another of Bezos’s conditions was that Biyani wouldn’t sell his assets — about 1,500 stores nationwide — to restricted persons, including Reliance, which operates India’s largest retail chain.

After the Future-Reliance deal was announced, Amazon alleged breach of contract and obtained an interim stay against the sale from an arbitrator in Singapore, a preferred neutral venue in Asia for settling disputes in cross-border agreements. The U.S. company then wrote a letter to Indian stock exchanges and the regulator, asking them to not approve the transaction.

Story continues

Future Retail has challenged Amazon’s position by saying that the Singapore ruling has no legal basis in India, and that anyway, it wasn’t a party to the founder’s agreement. Given the debilitating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on operations, the retailer says it’s doing the right thing by all stakeholders in selling assets to Reliance. As for Amazon’s claim of $193 million in damages plus interest, that liability, if awarded by the arbitrator, should fall on Biyani’s private firm that did the deal, Future Retail argues.

Biyani is just a pawn in a much bigger power play. Future's cash crunch didn't emerge suddenly. Amazon had ample opportunity to tiptoe around India’s legal restrictions on foreign ownership of retail chains to act as a white knight. But it didn’t.

Amazon may still be interested in partnering with Ambani — at the right price. Other investors, such as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co., have written him checks worth $5 billion in total. They may have feared losing out on what could become India’s most successful mix of physical and digital shopping, a strategy that leverages Reliance Retail’s own outlets together with independently owned neighborhood stores connected to Ambani’s 4G phone network of 400 million users. However, the portion offered to Amazon would mean a $20 billion commitment. Bezos could afford to see how well Ambani executes his plan.

Amazon’s India website kicked off its annual festival season last month to record sales in the first couple of days. Reliance Retail’s revenue also jumped 30% in the September quarter from the previous three months. But although India’s nationwide lockdown has ended, not all stores have reopened fully. Footfall has yet to recover, especially in fashion and lifestyle and at stores inside malls. In Macquarie’s estimates, the next fiscal year’s earnings per share for Reliance Industries, the holding company, may be 23% below the consensus street forecast. A reason, the brokerage says, is stiff competition, high investment and low margins in retail. Reliance Industries shares fell 8.6% in Mumbai on Monday.

Amazon’s letter to the Securities and Exchange Board of India makes a reference to India’s “ease of doing business,” which has been a sore point with foreign investors from Vodafone Group Plc to Cairn Energy Plc. The regulator needs to hold listed firms accountable for their dealings, Amazon said in the letter, according to Reuters, which has seen a copy.

The last thing India wants is more of a bad rap. The Seattle-based firm already has to operate with one hand tied behind its back: As a foreign e-commerce player, it can’t own inventory or openly discount merchandise. Even harsher rules — covering data and algorithms — may be on their way. It’s important for regulators to not give Amazon the chance to paint a commercial feud as another sign of India’s unfair treatment of global investors.

In more ways than one, a waiting game by Bezos may not be a bad idea.

451,2020-11-02T11:22:46+00:00,Lockdowns Mean Christmas Comes Early for Amazon,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For many retailers, the final three months of the year are traditionally known as the Golden Quarter, when non-food shops make the bulk of their profits.

The period this year will be far from sparkling — unless you are Amazon.com Inc. The online retailer is poised to be one of few winners from the U.K. government’s decision on Saturday to impose a four-week lockdown and the recent restrictions announced in France and Germany.

For everyone else, it is impossible to overstate just how damaging the new rules will be. Non-essential retailers across England will have to close their doors at a time when they were full of stock. The lockdown will include the Black Friday promotional period. Although I have argued that European retailers adopting the U.S. shopping holiday are making a grave mistake, it at least drives foot traffic to town centers and leads to some incremental sales. That won’t be the case this year.

Retailers that don’t sell online are the most exposed. Associated British Foods Plc, which owns cheap-chic retailer Primark in the U.K. and other countries including Germany and France, said on Monday that 57% of its selling space would be temporarily closed from Nov. 5. It estimated that it would lose 375 million pounds ($484 million) worth of sales from these shuttered stores.

Groups with strong internet offerings, such as Next Plc, should fare better, as should the supermarkets, which will still be allowed to stay open and sell non-food items. Underlining the likely rush to laptop and mobile ordering, online grocer Ocado Group Plc on Monday upgraded its profit forecasts for the current financial year.

Customers will also be able to order products online and collect them from stores, though the question is whether local warehouses will be able to cope with the deluge in demand.

Many consumers will simply turn to Amazon — especially when needing to buy Christmas gifts. The company was able to prosper during the spring lockdown by continuing to deliver a broad range of goods, while other retailers held back from supplying items they considered non-essential. (Amazon decided to halt its Black Friday radio campaign in France after the French government said it was inappropriate to promote it when other retailers were suffering.)

There are signs that some people started Christmas shopping early, which helped retail sales in September, according to an important sales monitor from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG. But this won’t make up for the loss of trade during the crucial weeks of November.

As for pubs and restaurants, they were already suffering from a dearth of office parties, as well as a 10 p.m. closing time across England. Still, having some customers was better than none. Now that’s off the table. And they probably won’t be able to count on a pre-Christmas rush. Some will be able to offer takeaway, but unless establishments appeal to a young, tech-savvy customer base, this won’t compensate for closed doors.

It is not even clear that hospitality will be able to reopen on Dec. 2. When businesses don’t know what to expect — Will they face further shuttering? Or a surge in trade once people can finally leave their homes? — it is very difficult to plan.

Needless to say, the forthcoming restrictions are not the Christmas gift that retailers, pubs and restaurants wanted.

452,2020-11-02T11:22:46+00:00,Lockdowns Mean Christmas Comes Early for Amazon,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For many retailers, the final three months of the year are traditionally known as the Golden Quarter, when non-food shops make the bulk of their profits.

The period this year will be far from sparkling — unless you are Amazon.com Inc. The online retailer is poised to be one of few winners from the U.K. government’s decision on Saturday to impose a four-week lockdown and the recent restrictions announced in France and Germany.

For everyone else, it is impossible to overstate just how damaging the new rules will be. Non-essential retailers across England will have to close their doors at a time when they were full of stock. The lockdown will include the Black Friday promotional period. Although I have argued that European retailers adopting the U.S. shopping holiday are making a grave mistake, it at least drives foot traffic to town centers and leads to some incremental sales. That won’t be the case this year.

Retailers that don’t sell online are the most exposed. Associated British Foods Plc, which owns cheap-chic retailer Primark in the U.K. and other countries including Germany and France, said on Monday that 57% of its selling space would be temporarily closed from Nov. 5. It estimated that it would lose 375 million pounds ($484 million) worth of sales from these shuttered stores.

The Final Round panel discusses the latest.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to ""The Final Round"" here on Yahoo Finance. I'm Seana Smith. As we wrap up the trading week and the month, taking a look at a selloff here, with all three of the major averages well in the red, although we are off the lows of the day. The Dow off just around 174 points, the S&P off just over 1%.

The NASDAQ has been hit hardest for the entire trading day. The NASDAQ off just around 2 and 1/2%. We were looking at losses of 3% not too long ago. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're seeing in some of those big tech names. Taking a look at Apple and Facebook and Amazon, all three of those names under tremendous amount of pressure.

[BELL]

And that does it for us today. Taking a look at where things settle down, S&P and NASDAQ all firmly in the red on a weekly basis. We're looking at the worst week for the major averages since March. On a monthly basis, this is the second month in a row that we're seeing declines here for stocks.

And taking a look at the Dow specifically, it's the worst month for the Dow since March that we've seen a lot of the selling action for most of the past couple of weeks. In terms of what's triggering the selling action today, a lot of that has to do with what we're seeing in big tech.

Three out of those four tech giants that we talked about yesterday that reported after the bell are moving lower today. Taking a look at Apple, that stock off just around 6%, Facebook also off around 6%. Amazon is also in the red. Google, it was a standout yesterday. It's the only one of those four names ending to the upside.

We talked about it going into these reports, but the bar was set very high, very little room for disappointment. And that's a big reason why we're seeing so many of those names under pressure today. Taking a look at the sector action, we're seeing that reflected in the sector action today. Technology, communications services, consumer discretionary, the worst performers today. All 11 of the S&P sectors are in the red.

Story continues

And then, of course, more broadly speaking, it's not just because of these earnings that we're seeing so much of the selling recently. Also investors are closely watching that rise in coronavirus case count throughout the country and also over in Europe. We also don't have a stimulus package and the possibility of a contested election. All of those factors here weighing on the markets over the last couple of weeks.

I'm joined by my co-host Myles Udland. We also have Akiko Fujita, Jared Blikre, and Rick Newman here joining the conversation for the next 30 minutes. And Myles, I'll just kick it over to you first because we're wrapping up what has been a pretty volatile month for stocks.

The Dow closing in the red for the month, as well as S&P and the NASDAQ. I mean, when you take a look at the losses today, just really highlights how much is riding on these earnings reports and how high the bar has been set going into these results.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, you know, it's gratifying. Not that we make predictions here at Yahoo Finance, but it's gratifying when I wrote in the Morning Brief, I think about nine days ago, that some data that we had looked at from Bespoke Investment Group, that that data suggested that companies weren't being rewarded for earnings beats. And here we are, nine days later, and we see all of these major companies reporting earnings beats. And with the exception of Alphabet, they all get punished for that.

And so this is certainly a material trend here that-- I mean, I guess there is plenty of earnings to go. These are the major highlights. It's one that investors will probably have to contend with, even as we get through the election. And it certainly will be a big part of the story as we get into the beginning of next year.

But really, what we're all thinking about now is what happens on Tuesday. And my favorite market stat-- and we can take it or leave it, whether it really matters, but is that if the S&P goes down from three months before the election to election day, that means the party in power flips. It's been that way every election since 1984. It's worked in every election, except for three, going back to 1928.

And I'm just looking at Yahoo Finance historical data here. The market closed on August the 3rd at 32.94. This is the S&P. Today, it closed at 32.70. So we'll see what happens over the next couple of sessions. It might mean something. It might mean nothing. But this is what our limited grasp of market history has told us is likely to happen. Essentially, this would suggest that Joe Biden is probably going to win on Tuesday.

SEANA SMITH: We'll see. We'll see if we can count on that. I don't know. 2020 has certainly thrown us a lot of curveballs, so--

MYLES UDLAND: I didn't make the rules. It's just some data mining. It's just what we have.

SEANA SMITH: Well, we like it. We always like a couple of good election facts. So it's a good way to wrap up the week. Jared, I just want to get your take just on what we've seen play out not only this week, but for the month of October. We've seen volatility really re-enter this space here, lots of uncertainty just in terms of what's going to happen on November 3. What do you make of the recent action that we've seen?

JARED BLIKRE: Well, the recent action, let's start with today. We had those big tech earnings, and it's also end of month. We could have seen some repositioning. We'll take a look at the bond market in a second because I think that has something to do with it, too, some really interesting things going on there.

But a lot of it just has to do with the heading into the election, also dealing with all these reclosings. We talked about Belgium reclosing. It looks like Germany might do something along those lines. And so if we take a look at the Dow here, this is the worst performer of the majors for the month, down 4.6%. NASDAQ off 2.3%, S&P 500 off a little bit more, 2.76%.

But I want to take a longer term look here. And, you know, at the beginning of the week, or I think it was one week ago, we were still talking about this potential cup and handle pattern. I guess that was two weeks ago maybe. But that really fell apart. And now what we have is a potential double top.

And so, at 32.50 is really turning out and 3,300 a kind of a big support area. So if this doesn't hold, we could have further downside, especially if there is a contested election next week.

So let's take a look at the bond market. Here's a 10-year T-note yield. We can see really picked up in October. We have this August bottom down here. And in the last two days alone, we've tacked on probably 8, 9 basis points for the month of October 18.

Now, we did get a lot of economic reports, and I'll say that we haven't been seeing the rise in bond yields being reflected in the breakevens or the inflation expectation. This is real yields. And when rates head higher, that drags on these big cap names that we've been looking at that reported earnings yesterday. So that's another source of some consternation here.

Then throw in the dollar and some fluctuations there. It's all interconnected, and it's all complicated, but here are the results. Let's take a look because we looked at this for long enough today. Let's take a look at our sectors here over the week.

And we can see that utilities down 3.6%. That was the best performing sector. And discretionary, that's an Amazon play, along with some others. You look at a ETF like IBUY, really a difficult couple of days here. So discretionary is down 6 and 1/2%.

And then if we go to the month to date, the only thing in the green again is utilities. A bit non-intuitive because they're competing with bonds for yields. You would have thought they'd been down, but maybe some M&A activity and some other things related to the COVID crisis explain that.

Bottom line to the downside, we see tech is the biggest, followed here down 5%, followed by energy and healthcare. Worth noting, too, that crude oil just is having its worst week in about three or four months here. So lots being reflected not only in the election trade and the uncertainty around that, but also the global lockdowns that we're seeing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-recap-friday-october-30-201813421.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'TWTR.US', 'XLC.US', 'XLF.US', 'XLK.US']","['AMAZON', 'NASDAQ']","{'polarity': 0.963, 'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.064}"

These types of stocks usually trade below the five-dollar mark, making them ideal for first-time investors as well. Although, penny stocks have their fair share of critics, the investment has garnered a cult following over the years. Many find it to be a lucrative investment avenue.

Penny stocks are especially popular in periods of economic uncertainty, as investors look for assets with a low capital cost.

But although penny stocks trade at a low price, there are known for their high volatility. This means they can make huge moves in a single day, generating high returns.

7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave

Given that penny stocks come with high risk, it is essential that you pick the stocks that show strong growth potential. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the top penny stocks to watch in November. None of these are sure bets, but they all have growth opportunities:

Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Titan Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TTNP) Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH) Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX) Rolls Royce Holdings (OTCMKTS:RYCEY) Neos Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NEOS) Cinedigm Corp (NASDAQ:CIDM)

It’s no secret that Nokia (NYSE:NOK) had a tough year, and its latest earnings didn’t help matters. The telecom giant reached a high of $5.14 in August before falling to $3.35 this month.

But, there are some events suggest that things are finally taking a turn for the better. The Finnish company announced that it has secured a $14.1 million grant from NASA to create a cellular network to the moon.

Nokia will partner with Intuitive Mechanics to build a 4G/LTE network to the moon by 2022. The goal is to create a communications hub for future missions and enable better exploration of habitation on the moon.

The biotech space saw a lot of action this year as the race to the Covid vaccine pushes full steam ahead. While Titan Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TTNP) is not a major contender for the vaccine, it does create therapeutics to treat chronic illnesses. TTNP stock is down 39.31% this year but shows promise for future growth.

On Sept. 15, Titan Pharmaceuticals announced that its partner company, Molteni entered a deal with Accord Healthcare. The healthcare company will commercialize and distribute Sixmo in the EU. According to Titan, “Sixmo is indicated for substitution treatment for opioid dependence in clinically stable adult patients.”

This could translate to increased revenue for Titan and improve its bottom line.

TTNP has been on an upward trend this past week and could keep going higher. Keep an eye on this penny stock.

Another industry that has seen a lot of activity this year is the food delivery services. As people work and play from home, food delivery has now become an essential service. One company that has benefitted from this trend is Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH). Dubbed as “mini Uber eats,” Waitr stock is up roughly 700% this year.

Unlike larger companies like Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER) and Postmates, Waitr serves smaller communities. The company’s share price went as high as $5.85 this year before falling back to $2.57 this month. However, Waitr shows signs of its momentum picking up once again thanks to a tableside service app.

The new technology will allow customers to order food and pay their bill by scanning a QR code on the Waitr app. This means customers can enjoy a meal at a restaurant with zero contact. The pandemic is likely to change traditional dining as we know it and Waitr’s savvy new app caters to this “new normal.” If that takes off, then WTRH stock could as well.

Dynavax stock (DVAX) a gold and clear pill capsule contains a representation of a DNA molecule

Another penny stock that is a beneficiary of the biotech momentum is Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX). The company uses cutting-edge technology to produce vaccines for the masses. The stock is currently trading at $4.16 and analyst estimate the price could go higher.

This confidence stems in part from Dynavax’s involvement in the Covid-19 vaccine race. But it’s not developing the vaccine itself. Rather, it’s developing an adjuvant to be delivered in combination with Medigen’s vaccine. The dual therapy has been granted a subsidy by Taiwan’s government and clinical trials have begun.

And analysts also expect to see a resurgence in sales for its hepatitis B treatment, Heplisav-B. Maybe that’s why the analysts’ consensus price target is $12, suggesting over 200% upside.

If either of these two options takes off, it could make this penny stock well worth your time.

The name Rolls Royce Holdings (OTCMKTS:RYCEY) is often synonymous with luxury cars, but the actual company has little to do with the auto industry itself. Rolls Royce Holdings is in fact a major player in the engineering space and creates technology for aerospace, big data and defense.

But as pandemic brought its aerospace segment to a halt, the other businesses are picking up the slack.

Rolls Royce recently announced a new R&D investment in its Power Systems business for $13.9 million. The goal behind the investment is to grow its power generation facility in Minnesota. The company is one of nine members chosen to build a nuclear power station in the U.K. This is in an effort to reduce carbon emissions in the country. This power segment will be a huge growth driver for RYCYE stock in the future.

Neos Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NEOS) is another innovative company making waves this year. The company creates treatments for people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Neos hit some major lows these past few years but is finally putting its dark days behind. Trading at just 70 cents per share, the penny stock is a steal at this price

Sales of the company’s amphetamine treatment of ADHD became stagnant during the pandemic. However, as classes go back in session via remote learning, sales of the medication are picking up. In addition to this, the company has also introduced a new co-pay program, Rx Connect. The goal behind this innovation is to increase the profitability of each prescription.

Digital entertainment has become the next big thing this year as theatres remain closed for the foreseeable future. Cinedigm Corp (NASDAQ:CIDM) is an entertainment company with a growing presence in this sector. The company distributes its products for Hallmark and Televisa (NYSE:TV) among others while also partnering with bigger players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Although Cinedigm Corp has been on a downward trend, the company recently announced that it will be expanding its digital streaming segment through television. It has already secured partnerships with Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Samsung to spearhead this development. The new expansion will allow Cinedigm to reach over 15.2 million eyeballs.

At a current price of just 50 cents, CIDM is a penny stock that’s worth watching in November.

455,2020-10-28T23:37:14+00:00,"EBay Growth Ebbs, Sparking Concern Pandemic Boost Is Over","(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc.’s marketplace growth slowed in the third quarter, worrying investors that an online shopping boost from the Covid-19 pandemic isn’t sustainable.

Gross merchandise volume, the value of all goods sold on the site, rose 22% in the third quarter, down from 26% growth in the second quarter. International GMV increased 16%, a smaller gain than the previous period.

“If you look at EBay prior to Covid, they were under-performing other e-commerce companies, and that’s the concern,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co. “Do we go back to that lackluster performance after Covid?”

The shares dropped 4% in extended trading after closing at $53.25 in New York.

Fourth-quarter sales will be $2.64 billion to $2.71 billion, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with $2.8 billion in revenue during last year’s fourth quarter. The new forecast partly reflects recent asset sales.

Pandemic-wary shoppers have turned to online marketplaces like EBay and Amazon.com Inc. to avoid stores in the era of social distancing. The company said it ended the quarter with 183 million active buyers. That was less than analysts’ average prediction for almost 184 million, raising fears about customer growth.

Investors may be concerned that EBay’s growth is lagging behind e-commerce growth overall, which is more than 30%, said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. “You could argue they are still losing share here,” he added.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone, who took the helm in April, is still trying to show that a slimmed-down EBay can lure customers and get them to spend more on the site. Under pressure from activist investors, EBay in February completed the sale of its event-tickets marketplace StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion. In July, EBay sold the classifieds business to Norway’s Adevinta ASA in a cash and stock deal worth $9.2 billion that leaves EBay with a 44.4% stake in the company.

Story continues

Iannone said he is focusing on refurbished products with two-year warranties from brands like DeLonghi and Makita. The market for refurbished brand goods is in the tens of billions of dollars and is a good fit for EBay deal-seekers, he said. The company is also developing authentication services for luxury watches and second-hand sneakers to attract more high-value products to the site and increase average order sizes, the CEO added.

EBay has deals with United Parcel Service Inc. and other carriers to protect sellers from shipping capacity issues and surcharges over the busy holiday period, he noted.

“We’re well positioned to help sellers reach buyers this holiday season,” Iannone said.

In the fourth quarter, profit, excluding some items, will be 78 to 84 cents a share, EBay said, compared with analysts’ estimates of 80 cents. Third-quarter revenue rose 25% to $2.6 billion. Analysts estimated $2.58 billion. Profit before certain items in the recent period was 85 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 80 cents.

The company is also developing authentication services for luxury watches and second-hand sneakers to attract more high-value products to the site and increase average order sizes, the CEO added.

EBay has deals with United Parcel Service Inc. and other carriers to protect sellers from shipping capacity issues and surcharges over the busy holiday period, he noted.

“We’re well positioned to help sellers reach buyers this holiday season,” Iannone said.

In the fourth quarter, profit, excluding some items, will be 78 to 84 cents a share, EBay said, compared with analysts’ estimates of 80 cents. Third-quarter revenue rose 25% to $2.6 billion. Analysts estimated $2.58 billion. Profit before certain items in the recent period was 85 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 80 cents.

457,2020-10-28T21:01:00+00:00,"Blackrock, Bezos And Musk Charging Ahead in this $30 Trillion Mega-Trend","A massive $250 billion has poured into ESG index funds since August, making ESG an investing megatrend that’s soared over 733% in just two years and has had over $30 trillion invested globally.

This is Big Capital’s new safe haven and some of the largest names in finance and tech from Goldman Sachs, to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are investing heavily.

ESG is considered a less risky and increasingly lucrative corner of Wall Street.

The multi-trillion-dollar reality is that tech and ESG are now inextricably linked.

And they are massively outperforming the market.

The holy grail of this new trend, therefore, should be a solid ESG platform combined with an impressive tech ecosystem.

And now, there’s a company that’s managed to do just that. Facedrive (TSXV:FD; OTC:FDVRF)—the Canadian tech darling that’s been stealing headlines across multiple sectors.

It’s a company that’s grasped the enormity of this megatrend.

It knows what Big Capital—like the $7 trillion finance giant BlackRock —wants.

It understands that big money is looking for more places to park on the in-demand ESG playing field.

And it doesn’t want a limited, one-off opportunity.

It wants an entire ecosystem of ESG tech offerings with limitless verticals.

That’s why Facedrive, one of the most impressively ambitious innovators to have come out of Canada’s Waterloo ‘Technology Triangle’ (aka the new ‘Silicon Valley’) - has created, launched, and exceptionally branded 6 entire ESG divisions in just one year.

It’s been hot on the acquisition trail for months, and its latest grab was a game-changer:

Two Huge Disruptors in Two Months

In September, Facedrive scooped up Chicago-based Steer, an EV subscription service that aims to upend the $5 trillion global transportation industry, in a deal that includes a $2-million strategic investment by energy giant Exelon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC. Steer

The pioneer of carbon-offset ride-sharing in Canada, Facedrive—behind the wheel of Steer—plans to completely change the way people view car ownership.

Story continues

Anyone who wanted but couldn’t afford an EV before, can now afford an EV ride, with Steer. That means Steer and its heavy-weight owners and backers will be disrupting industry segments on multiple levels.

Exelon’s (NASDAQ:EXC) market cap is ~$41 billion … and it’s not the only huge market-cap company whose radar Facedrive is pinging: There’s also a tie-in to ecommerce king Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ….

Steer is at the crossroads where $25 trillion meets:

The $5 trillion IT industry The $12 trillion digital economy The $8 trillion auto industry

And it’s all boosted by the fastest-growing megatrend of the year—ESG investing.

But Steer is just the most recent move by Facedrive, the tech giant’s previous deal was arguably even bigger.

In August, Facedrive acquired Tally Technologies, the high-tech major league sports predicting startup founded by NFL superstar Russel Wilson.

Tally came out of TraceMe, a celebrity content app founded by Wilson with early-in investors from the biggest tech companies in the world and acquired by Nike last year.

And that acquisition turned some of the biggest names in the tech industry into Facedrive shareholders … because the transaction was a share exchange that saw Facedrive inject $1M in cash in Tally and $2M in Facedrive shares.

Now, Tally plans to revolutionize major league sports with “gamification” and online fan engagement.

Gamified for ultimate fan engagement, this major league sports platform will now be free-to-play and predictive.

That means new revenue potential for major leagues sports, which is exactly why Tally has already been chosen by the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB as the premier tech solution.

All-Inclusive Tech on the Front Lines of COVID-19

There’s hardly a better “impact” investing element to add to your ESG portfolio than a contact tracing app designed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic with its very own line of wearables …

The company’s TraceSCAN contact-tracing technology is positioned to help save the tourism industry, which is facing $1 trillion in losses due to the pandemic and is expected to shed 100 million jobs before the year is out worldwide.

Aviation giant Air Canada is already on board.

On October 7th, Air Canada signed a deal with Facedrive Inc. (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) to launch a pilot project for its employees using proprietary TraceSCAN technology.

TraceSCAN Wearables could help the tourism industry deal with COVID. Facedrive combines complex algorithms in an AI-enabled mobile application with wearable devices built on the industry standard nRF52 Bluetooth chipset.

That means it can reach those millions of workers around the world, from construction and medical to education and security, who can’t operate with a phone in hand 24/7, as well as the at-risk elderly.

It’s fully mobile COVID-19 detection on a wristband, in a tag worn around the neck or in a pocket pod. And it intends to get us back to work, and back to fun--safely. FD

Air Canada isn’t the only major airline taking the TraceSCAN plunge...

The Government of Ontario lent its support to TraceSCAN back in July because it’s the only feasible technology that will help get masses of government employees back to work without spreading COVID-19.

And now, talks with other airlines are in motion because the industry is facing more than $84 billion in losses … so, the news flow is expected to be fast and momentous.

The Tech Company That Has It All

Even before it acquired Steer with the aim to change the way we view car ownership …

And before it jumped into Tally, the innovative tech that creates major sports revenue verticals for our interactive, engaged future …

Facedrive already had 5 ESG divisions, making it a one-stop-shop for multi-industry tech-driven ESG.

From its pioneering carbon-neutral ride-sharing and long-distance carpooling platform, food and pharmacy deliveries and COVID contact-trading to its own celebrity-branded merch marketplace (think: Will Smith’s Bel Air Athletics) and a blockbuster social distancing trivia and social engagement app, Facedrive has the kind of verticals the new big money is looking for.

Until now, Facedrive’s ESG platform has been stealing headlines across industries in Canada…

But the Steer deal plants it firmly in the United States, where the next big push is about to take place.

Big names have already tied into this wide-ranging tech play … from energy giant Exelon to Air Canada …

There’s been no faster news flow coming out of the Toronto Stock Exchange than this …

And the next big name to sign on to any one of these tech deals is likely to have serious impact.

Some other companies looking to capitalize on the sustainability push:

Facebook (FB) has truly taken the ESG trend to heart. It has dedicated a lot of resources on constructing more sustainable work environments. It's building designs integrate a variety of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all items taken in on-site. Not only that, it also focuses on its workforce, with equal opportunity hiring policies, ample time off, and much more.

Facebook is also taking an ingenious approach in its goal to cut back its carbon footprint. Its massive data centers are some of the most efficient on the planet. And it's only beginning. By the end of this year, Facebook intends to have all of its data centers running on 100% green energy.

Microsoft (MSFT) is another key tech giant integrating sustainability into its business model. Microsoft is going above and beyond in its carbon emissions promise. It is aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. Not just is the tech giant taking a major role in minimizing its carbon emissions, but it is also at the forefront of a technological wave that is actively helping other companies control their emissions.

Microsoft has built many new technologies to assist and assess the impact of different companies on the environment, helping collect data to better comprehend where and how the world can become greener. In addition, Microsoft is creating tools to better control water use and curb the world's growing waste issues.

Not to be outdone, Google (GOOGL) is fixated on raising the bar for the smart use of the world's dwindling resources. Like Facebook, Google is developing sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and office environments. It is likewise leveraging artificial intelligence to create a system that will help the world use energy in a more efficient manner.

Google is also concentrated on building a sustainable supply chain. It is dedicated to enhancing the lives of everyone linked to its products, from its data centers to truck drivers and beyond. Additionally, it is actively decreasing its ecological impact by working with suppliers to offer them the tools and tech they need to become more energy efficient.

NextEra Energy (NEE), the world leader in solar and wind producer, is playing a crucial role in the course towards sustainability. In fact, in 2018, the business was the top capital investor in green energy facilities and the 5th biggest investor across all sectors.

In addition to its huge influence on global climate change, it has a plan to invest another $55 billion in American energy facilities in the next 2 years. All while keeping a firm dedication to minimize its reliance on foreign oil. Since 2001, it has detached itself from foreign oil almost entirely, announcing a 98% decline over the past twenty years. Much more enticing, however, is its dedication to developing investor value. Over the past 15 years, investors have seen 945% returns.

We can’t talk about ESG without mentioning Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA).There’s a reason Tesla has performed so well this year. Investors love Elon Musk’s vision. As one of the world’s most innovative car manufacturers, it has single-handedly made electric vehicles cool. Its slick design is beloved across the world. In fact, it’s almost impossible to NOT see a Tesla in cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco.

Though Tesla has received some poor marks for its workplace health and safety due to a few incidents of employees feeling overworked and under-appreciated compared to its peers, Tesla scores very high on pollution prevention and corporate governance.

Canadian business are doing their part:

Stars Group Inc (TSX:TSGI) is a world leader in the online and mobile gaming industry. With a focus on maintaining high regulatory standards while simultaneously offering a wide range of products across multiple platforms, Stars has solidified its place among the gaming hierarchy.

In December, Stars Group secured a major partnership with the National Basketball Association in order to use data and league marks across their digital sports betting offerings.

Scott Kaufman-Ross, Head of Fantasy & Gaming, NBA explained, ""This dynamic partnership will be another way to create authentic fan engagement with league logos and official NBA betting data, while leveraging Stars' global expertise to further optimize the fan experience.

ePlay Digital Inc. (CSE:EPY) creates technology that helps TV networks, esports teams and leagues and even venues cut through the noise to reach their target audience. The company brings together multiple platforms to create engagement across social media, traditional media, streaming, and more. With a team built from sports, esports, and gaming experts, ePlay knows the video game industry inside and out. That’s why they’ve secured partnerships with companies including Time Warner Cable, ESPN, Sony Pictures, AXS TV, Intel, AXN, Fiat, CBS, Cineplex, and others.

Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR) is major player in the Canadian telecoms sector. It owns a ton of infrastructure throughout Canada and its cloud services and open-source projects look to address some of the biggest issues that its customers might face before the customers even face them.

As online gaming depends on solid internet connections, Shaw will likely become a backdoor benefactor in increased online activity.

Telus Corporation (TSX:T) is Canada’s second largest internet provider, serving over 8 million Canadians from coast to coast. Though it’s not producing its own content, it is carving out its own path in the industry thanks to its innovative approach to technology and investments across multiple sectors.

Like Shaw, Telus will be another company to watch as gamers, and the general population, turn to their phones and computers for entertainment.

Pollard Banknote Ltd. (TSX:PBL)

Pollard Banknote is one of the world’s largest instant scratch-off lottery suppliers for over 30 years, distributing tickets to over 60 lottery and charitable gaming organizations across the globe. With top-tier marketing, new design developments and other innovative measures, Pollard has solidified its position as one of the greats.

One way that Pollard sets itself apart from the competition is its social media presence. Pollard has worked hard to leverage new media outlets including Facebook and Twitter to really up its marketing game…and its efforts show.

458,2020-10-27T07:55:20+00:00,"Apple Plans Smaller AirPods Pro, Revamped Entry-Level Model","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning updates to its AirPods earbuds next year, seeking to capitalize on the success of a product that has become an important source of growth.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on two new models: third-generation entry-level AirPods and the second version of the AirPods Pro earbuds, according to people familiar with the plans.

The models will join other new Apple audio devices like the HomePod mini and upcoming over-ear headphones. The company has also weighed launching another smart speaker that would sit between the HomePod mini and the original version in the line up.

The design of the updated entry-level AirPods will be similar to the current AirPods Pro, gaining a shorter stem and replaceable ear tips. Apple is also looking to improve battery life. That model however will not have higher-end AirPods Pro features like noise-cancellation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

For the new AirPods Pro, Apple is aiming to make the earbuds more compact by eliminating the short stem that currently sticks out from the bottom. A design in testing has a more rounded shape that fills more of a user’s a ear -- similar to the latest designs from Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Google.

Integrating noise-cancellation, wireless antennas and microphones into a smaller AirPods Pro casing has proved challenging during development, which could result in a less ambitious design when the product is finalized, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Apple has internally discussed launching the new low-end AirPods during the first half of next year. The company is also planning new wireless chips to power both models. Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Goertek Inc. are expected to handle most of the production for the new earbuds.

Goertek, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from Apple, jumped 2.5% to a record in Shenzhen trading Tuesday. Luxshare inched up 0.2%, after having more than doubled this year.

Story continues

After being mocked by some early on, AirPods have become one of Apple’s biggest hits in recent years. The company’s Wearables, Home and Accessories division, which includes AirPods, reported $6.5 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up more than 70% from two years ago. The earbuds may get a new sales boost soon because Apple stopped including headphones with new iPhones.

The success has attracted rivals such as China’s Xiaomi Corp. that offer more affordable options.

Apple currently sells entry-level AirPods for $159 and the AirPods Pro at $249. The original AirPods launched in 2016 and were last updated in March 2019. The AirPods Pro came out in October last year.

Beyond the new AirPods, Apple has also internally weighed a new HomePod that sits in size, price and sound quality between the original $299 HomePod and the $99 HomePod mini. It’s unclear if Apple will ultimately launch that product or just further cut the price of the higher-end version.

Apple is still planning to announce high-end, noise-canceling over-ear headphones. The device has faced several development challenges over the past two years and has been delayed multiple times.

The headphones were due to go into production weeks ago, but that was pushed back due to problems with the headband, a person familiar with the matter said. That part was deemed too tight in some testing.

The company initially wanted to include large touch pads on the sides of the headphones, but reduced the size of those panels. Apple has also scaled back some of the interchangeable functionality of the headphones that were a hallmark of the initial concept. The latest version of the product is likely to lack a replaceable headband, but could still include interchangeable ear pads.

460,2020-10-23T12:00:00+00:00,US economy needs ‘fundamental changes’ to expand opportunity: Nicholas Kristof,"New York Times columnist and 'Tightrope"" author, Nicholas Kristof, joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the health if the U.S. economy.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: We talked about wealth and income inequality that's part of ""Tightrope."" But that the rich and the super rich in the Silicon Valley and the billionaires, particularly during COVID, inadvertently, getting even wealthier than they were before. How can we address this, or should we?

NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I think we should address inequality. And, you know, but maybe inequality is the wrong framework. You know, inequality is a word that tends to get liberals focused, but it tends to turn off conservatives. Opportunity is a word that everybody unites around.

I think I saw a poll that 97% of Americans agree there should be more opportunity for America's kids. And 97% of Americans don't agree that the world is round. That's a huge consensus. And so, you know, I think the fact that you can predict a child's outcome based on a zip code in which they are born should be a scandal.

The fact that in, at least, three American counties, life expectancy is shorter than in Cambodia or Bangladesh. That's-- you know, that's not because those kids are showing a lack of personal responsibility. It's because we as a country are showing a lack of personal responsibility.

And one of the things-- one of the reasons we wrote ""Tightrope"" into this documentary is really an attempt to highlight the need for fundamental changes to provide greater opportunity for kids in ways that not only help those kids, but also restore a better future for the country as a whole.

ANDY SERWER: You know, I love the zip code work that you do. And I saw that you did it in that tax cheat story comparing this woman in prison to President Trump. And then that audit by zip code thing where the most audited zip codes are these impoverished county, the one in the number one in Mississippi with a high-- a level of African-American residents, right?

Story continues

NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Yeah, that's right. That's Humphrey's County, Mississippi and has the highest rate of tax audits in the country. And it's a majority African-American county with I think a per capita income of $28,000 or something. And the idea that that is where the IRS is focusing its resources. And, meanwhile, if I remember right, only 0.8% of 2018 tax filings of more than $10 million have been audited.

You know, there-- there is something wrong with this picture. And it reflects an inequality not only of wealth and income, but an inequality of opportunity and inequality of political power and of a kind of human rights. So I think we need to look at these sort of basic issues of fairness of who we are. And these are complicated. They're hard. They're no easy policies. But other countries, Canada manages to largely figure these out. So does Germany. So does Japan. You know, I think we-- we can do better than we are.

ANDY SERWER: Another hot button topic right now, Nick, is stimulus and what Washington should do to get our economy back on track. Do these checks to Americans work? What's the best way for the government to help us out during the pandemic, you think?

NICHOLAS KRISTOF: The fact that we can't manage a new stimulus package when, 10% of American households with children now say they don't have enough food in the last week is just unconscionable. And I-- I worry that if it doesn't happen before the election that it won't happen before January either.

We also have troubling indications that suicide is up, that use of-- of drugs is up. One person in ""Tightrope"" who runs a drug treatment program, she estimated to me that-- that relapses are up 50% because of the pandemic. And so what we have is a pandemic of disease that is now followed by a pandemic of hunger of school dropouts, of mental health crises, of drug dependency and of suicide.

And there-- you know, there are no easy ways to address it. But we do know that that early effort in the spring to send checks to homes did seem to make a huge difference. And it also, as best economists can tell, did not seem to impede people returning to jobs. So I would very much like to see a new stimulus package aimed at sending out-- sending out checks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-economy-needs-fundamental-changes-120000425.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SNAP.US', 'SPXL.US', 'SPXS.US', 'SPXU.US', 'TQQQ.US', 'TSLA.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VZ.US', 'ZM.US']","['ANDY SERWER', 'INCOME INEQUALITY', 'NICHOLAS KRISTOF']","{'polarity': 0.984, 'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.113}"
461,2020-10-23T07:25:47+00:00,Walmart’s Flipkart Invests $204 Million in Birla’s Retail Business,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart Inc.’s Indian e-commerce operation Flipkart invested 15 billion rupees ($204 million) in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd. as it looks to bolster its presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing retail markets.

Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s retail business will issue preference shares to Flipkart, giving it a 7.8% stake, Aditya Birla Fashion said in an exchange filing Friday. The transaction was at 205 rupees a share, a 34% premium to Thursday’s closing price of 153.5 rupees.

The stock surged as much as 12.2% in Mumbai after the news. The deal underscores the race among e-commerce companies for brick-and-mortar assets as they look to penetrate into smaller towns in India. So-called Tier-II cities accounted for 60% of customers for both Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc. during India’s annual festive sales last week.

Amazon has acquired small stakes in other Indian retail chains in recent years, such as Shoppers Stop Ltd. and Future Group. India’s modern retail market will more than double to $188 billion by 2023 from $79 billion in 2018, according to consultant Technopak Advisors.

463,2020-10-20T13:00:00+00:00,Retool Nears $1 Billion Valuation With Funding From Sequoia,"(Bloomberg) -- Retool, Inc., a startup that’s less than four years old, is worth almost $1 billion after raising money from some of Silicon Valley’s top investors including Sequoia Capital and executives from GitHub Inc. and Stripe Inc.

The San Francisco-based company recently completed a $50 million financing that was led by Sequoia and values Retool at $925 million. That follows an earlier $25 million round. Other backers include GitHub Chief Executive Officer Nat Friedman, Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Brex Inc. founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, and Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham.

Retool is riding a wave of interest in products that make it easier for developers to build applications and other software. The value of this part of the tech industry was highlighted in 2018 when GitHub, which helps developers share code and collaborate, was bought by Microsoft Corp. for $7.5 billion.

While GitHub caters to mostly expert software developers, there’s huge demand for this type of support among less tech-savvy workers. That’s led to an explosion of low-code offerings that don’t require as much knowhow and no-code services, which need no prior coding knowledge.

Retool is taking a low-code approach and the startup focuses on companies that need to build their own internal software tools. Instead of writing software from scratch, these customers can drag and drop Retool’s pre-made building blocks into place, and then use their own code to tweak or customize the final product.

David Hsu, a 25 year-old software engineer, founded Retool in 2017 after realizing how much time he wasted building internal applications in a similar way over and over again. “Lots of engineers fundamentally don’t want to do that,” he said.

The first few lines of code for Retool were written in March 2017. That summer, Retool presented at Y Combinator’s Demo Day, an almost sacred Silicon Valley ritual that showcases promising young startups twice a year. A $1 million seed round followed, and soon after the first customers started using Retool.

Story continues

The company says its service helps developers build applications up to 40 times faster while retaining the flexibility of writing their own code. Customers include Amazon.com Inc., Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Progressive Corp., Peloton Interactive Inc. and Rakuten Inc.

Bryan Schreier, partner at Sequoia, said he was drawn to Retool based on his experience at Google. Schreier oversaw a team building internal tools and he said most of his colleagues were “desperate to do just about anything else.”

Schreier, a Retool board member, also noted that Hsu insisted on keeping Retool’s valuation below $1 billion. That milestone gains startups the coveted “unicorn” status, but the phenomenon has sometimes caused young companies to expand too quickly with disastrous results.

“There is a tendency to glorify a billion-dollar valuation,” Hsu said. “We want to signal that to people that we are just getting started.”

465,2020-10-20T04:00:52+00:00,Race to Become Russia’s Amazon Is Heating Up,"(Bloomberg) -- Covid-19 has driven a projected 10 million more Russian consumers online, accelerating the race to become the country’s answer to Amazon.com Inc.

The chance to dominate e-commerce in the world’s biggest country is still very much up for grabs. Russia’s largest online retailer, Wildberries, controls only 13% of the market, even after its sales doubled in the first nine months of the year. By contrast, Amazon accounts for about half of the U.S. market.

“Aided by the pandemic, large e-commerce platforms are gobbling up market share from both offline and online stores,” said Marat Ibragimov, an analyst at Gazprombank. “Competition is heating up, and in the future two or three will dominate.”

Russia has more internet users than Amazon’s No. 2 market, Germany. Yet entrenched consumer habits and logistical challenges have stymied e-commerce in the country and discouraged foreign companies like Amazon from doing business there.

After President Vladimir Putin ordered stores to close for almost two months during the first wave of Covid-19 in the spring, that left consumers with little choice but to give e-commerce a try. Internet sales are projected to surge 44% in 2020 to 2.5 trillion rubles ($32 billion), according to researcher Data Insight.

“When the authorities shut the local market because of Covid-19, all I could do was to try the internet,” said Nadezhda Nikulina, 62, who lives in northwest Russia and mainly uses Wildberries. “I found it really convenient, and the choice is enormous.”

Online purchases will account for just over 10% of Russian retail sales in 2020, up from 6% last year, according to industry lobby group AKIT. That compares with 16% in the U.S. and 37% in China in 2019.

Internet shopping hasn’t taken off as quickly in part because of the difficulties involved in making deliveries in such a large country. Even the national mail service only recently started experimenting with home delivery. A widespread reluctance to pay for goods before they’re received—a holdover from Russia’s chaotic transition to a market economy in the 1990s—has also played a role.

Story continues

The local market remains fractured, with thousands of internet shops, including offerings from traditional retailers such as electronics store M.video and children’s goods chain Detsky Mir. But there is a trend toward Amazon-style marketplaces.

Wildberries started in 2004 as an online clothing merchant, but now sells items ranging from food to electronic goods. More than 90% of its deliveries go to a network of 26,000 pickup points around Russia—the biggest distribution network outside of the national post—that allow customers to try on goods before taking them home.

There are three other main contenders to become Russia’s answer to Amazon.

One is AliExpress, a joint venture between China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and London-listed Mail.ru Group Ltd. After losing market share because of the long delivery time for orders from China, it has begun working with more local suppliers. AliExpress subsidizes delivery costs and provides same-day service on some goods through a partnership with the state postal service.

Ozon, a Russian copycat of Amazon backed by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov and Baring Vostok Capital Partners, offers next-day delivery to 40% of the population. But deliveries to Siberia can take as long as five days.

Ozon announced in October that it applied to sell shares in the U.S. to fund further growth, after more than doubling sales in the first half. It has set up a network of drop boxes near customers’ apartments, while also offering direct shipments through partners.

The smallest competitor to date is Yandex NV, which accounts for 2% of the online retail market. Yandex already runs Russia’s leading search engine and its biggest car-hailing service. After an attempt to create an online marketplace with Sberbank PJSC ended earlier this year, Yandex sold $1 billion in shares to billionaire Roman Abramovich and other partners to invest more in e-commerce.

467,2020-10-20T00:36:10+00:00,SoftBank Amasses Over $20 Billion in Public Stock Unit,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. charged ahead with its new public stock trading arm, increasing equity positions to more than $20 billion despite an initially skeptical response from shareholders, according to a person familiar with the investments.

Bloomberg reported in August that SoftBank had been targeting more than $10 billion and that the sum could reach into the tens of billions. The Japanese conglomerate considered tempering its trading plans in early September after reports that SoftBank’s spending spree was stirring froth in tech stocks. The news erased about $9 billion in market value for SoftBank at the time.

Over the past few weeks, SoftBank renewed its commitment to the public equities trading arm, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The strategy is currently built around expectations of a volatile third-quarter earnings season, the people said. SoftBank has been buying out-of-the-money call options, which deliver returns when share prices rise, and selling calls at even higher prices, one of the people said. Call spreads, as they’re known, cap gains but reduce the initial cost.

A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment. Shares fell about 1.5% in Tokyo trading after hitting a new 20-year high on Monday.

Earnings season is proving to be especially unpredictable. On Oct. 12, the Nasdaq 100 index underwent the biggest rally since April, and options-derived measures of volatility also rose.

An unidentified trader recently purchased around $200 million worth of call contracts on tech stocks in a single day. Call open interest in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. has averaged 12.9 million contracts over the 30 days through Monday, the highest since early 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank founder who’s leading the effort to create the equities arm inside his company, has been reluctant to provide many details about his trading strategy. The company has talked more about a broader strategy of selling assets, paring debt and buying back shares that has been well-received by investors. The stock rose to a 20-year high Monday, the highest level since March 2000 in the midst of the dot-com boom.

Story continues

In August, SoftBank disclosed holdings of $3.9 billion in stocks such as Amazon, which reports financial results on Oct. 29, and Netflix, which reports Tuesday. It has bought a lot more stock since then. While focusing on major tech stocks, SoftBank has also been expanding to smaller companies. Last week, it invested $215 million in Norway-based Kahoot, which makes education software.

Gerald Storch, Storch Advisors CEO and former Toys ‘R’ Us Chairman & CEO, joins The Final Round to discuss his thoughts and what the retail sales data says about the U.S.’ economic recovery.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to ""The Final Round."" We want to bring back in Gerald Storch, the CEO of Storch Advisors, also the former CEO of Toys R' US. And Gerald, we were just talking about the resilient consumer, what we've seen and what you expect here for the holiday season. We've spoken in a number of times in the past just about how consumers are shifting, when, where, and how they shop. What do you expect this breakdown to be this holiday season?

GERALD STORCH: I don't think we're going to see much change. There was a lot of talk about how apparel numbers were better this month than last month. And they were, in fact, you know, improved month over month. But they're still way down year over year. Same thing with department store sales.

And I just don't think that's where people's heads are right now. They're not spending to dress up and go out and, you know, look fancy. They're spending on their homes. We saw a 19% increase year over year in sales and home improvement stores. That is spectacular. I don't think we've ever seen an increase like that.

So consumers are spending on their homes. They're clearly spending on electronics. I don't know. I tried to buy the new Apple, you know, the iPhone 12 this morning. It took me forever just to get in to be able to buy it for $1,300, you know?

So they're going to spend on electronics. They're going to spend on their home. They're going to keep spending at Target and Walmart and Costco, where they can get everything in one place. They're going to keep spending on groceries and necessities. They will not be spending on clothing and department stores. And they're going to spend a lot of this money online.

Story continues

DAN ROBERTS: Gerald, Dan Roberts here. You mentioned a lot of names there that you rattled off that we have watched closely that have seen huge e-commerce gains. And before the break, you were saying you expect to see holiday sales bump for toys, thanks to online. I mean, Walmart, Target-- you mentioned electronics-- Best Buy. All of these names, Dick's Sporting Goods, we've talked about them to death in the last few months, because they've seen massive gains in their e-commerce.

As a result, though, and especially as the former Toys 'R' US CEO, I'm left wondering whether independent one-off stores that are not big chains and don't have big digital presences are in big, big trouble. I mean, independent toy stores that just have one location and had been there a while and are beloved by their neighborhoods, are they--

GERALD STORCH: Great question, Dan. I think you're 100% right. There is a massive consolidation of power taking place in retail. People are asking, well, can these stocks that have gone way up, you know, Target, Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, Dollar General, can they keep going? It's going to keep going.

They're consolidating their market share. They're gaining share every day. And of course, Amazon's got to be included in that. It's the mom and pops that are losing. Many of them had to shut during the pandemic because they were viewed as nonessential retailers, so they lost a lot of money. They're in very bad shape, and they're shuttering.

So it's absolutely true what you say. Power is consolidating. Shares is consolidating in retailing. The bigger are getting bigger. And frankly, I'm going to bet more of the same. It's not going to change.

SEANA SMITH: Gerald, I mean, so mom and pops obviously at a disadvantage. But it's not just the smaller stores. We've seen a number of chains file for bankruptcy. Just where are we in the bankruptcy picture right now? Is it going to go from bad to worse next year, or have we seen the worst of it?

GERALD STORCH: It's going to go from bad to bad. I don't know if it's worse. It's been pretty darn bad. But keep in mind, most of the companies that have filed for bankruptcy-- I know you have a chart up there. So one thing, clothing. There are apparel retailers and department stores, and it's not going to get better anytime soon.

You know, apparel has been on a secular decline for a decade, losing share to hard line, some of the categories we discussed earlier. That is not going to change. But until people return to the office, until there are events where you need to get dressed up, apparel will continue to decline. You can wear the same sport coat every day on Google, on Teams, or on Zoom. No one would even know, you know.

And people are not spending their money there. They're living where they are. We're all at home. What do you need at home? You need a new refrigerator. You need, you know-- you need that air fryer, you know? You need a great electronics get-up, you know? You need a great cell phone. That's where people are going to spend their money, and it's not going to change anytime soon. And frankly, I think we've seen kind of a long-term shift as fewer people actually return to work downtown.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly something to keep an eye on and certainly having a massive impact on a lot of these huge retail chains. All right, Gerald Storch, always great to have you. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us.

469,2020-10-14T20:28:54+00:00,How Millennials and Gen Z are driving digital trends,"On Wednesday, Cowen released the findings of a survey on how Gen Z and millennials are driving the shift in spending power, with the COVID-19 pandemic further dividing shopping preferences and attitudes among generational cohorts. The Final Round breaks down which companies are the winners amid this generational shift in shopping trends.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JEN ROGERS: Welcome back to ""The Final Round."" This is our call of the day. It is a deep dive from Cowen on how Gen Z and millennials are the driving force in scaling digital and sustainability. OK, this thing is 142 pages.

The takeaways are that all of these people are moving to the suburbs. They like to know where their food comes from. And they like to buy used clothes. And they don't trust CNN or Fox.

Melody Hahm, what am I supposed to do with this information? I feel like Amazon was mentioned the most in here. Like, that, to me, I was like, OK, they're all going to shop at Amazon. But they had all these other tickers in there. What did you make of it?

MELODY HAHM: What I have to say, Jen, is this sort of hearkens back to an HBS report in 2017. And Rick Newman and I actually had a very robust debate about this of, what is the purpose of calling someone a millennial? Because a 31-year-old in Oklahoma and a 31-year-old in the suburbs of New York are not the same demographic, right? It just blatantly is comparing apples to oranges.

So to really lump this 18 to 34-year-old bracket-- I understand they kind of parsed through some of the data-- that is particularly troublesome to me. And I think time and time again, you know, this is sort of taking a page out of Piper Sandler's notebook, right? We talked about the Teen Survey at length last week.

And I think one of the things that really interests me from this note, though, is I had no idea that the generation after Gen Z, those born after 2011, are called Gen Alpha. And those who are born-- who are going to be born in 2025 to 2039, they'll be called Gen Beta. My understanding from the ""Atlantic"" article was that people born during this era is, they will be called generation C, after coronavirus.

But that's neither here nor there. To your point, Jen, the overarching theme of, we get it, Amazonification, Amazonian empire, we all are sort of suckers to that system.

But at the same time, those athleisure brands like Lululemon, like VF Corp, the Nike's, the Puma's, the Champion's of the worlds, that essentially are all legacy brands, it's sort of counterintuitive, right? Because there's another section of the note that says Instagram has really lowered the barrier to entry for a lot of retail plays and for a new discovery and for shopability and some really interesting, innovative, fun, digital native brands.

But at the same time, the bottom line is, these tickers, to your point, are the ones that really resonate even with 18, 19, 20-year-olds. And I can tell you, even the brands that we see on Instagram, a lot of them are sort of re-outfitting the Champion's, right? Or vintage Nike wear or Levi's and sort of refurbishing them and putting on a little sticker or something.

And so what's old is new. What's new is old. We're all moving to the suburbs. And there's not anything particularly compelling or particularly novel about the way that we're behaving, perhaps, except spending more time on social.

DAN ROBERTS: And, guys, to play off what Melody said, what's old is new, what stood out most to me in this note, you know, you hear that this generation-- I guess it's us-- you know, they're suburbanizing, they care about sustainability, care about digital. And yet, which companies are listed that will benefit? It's old, big chains.

I mean, you mentioned, Jen, oh, you saw Amazon a lot here. Sure, but listen to this. Suburbanization theme has long tailed-- by the way, I wish Myles Udland were here because he has been obsessed with discussing the exodus from the cities and the suburbanization. But it will support leading retailers and restaurant.

And they list Dick's Sporting Goods, Target, Walmart, Restoration Hardware-- we just spoke about them two weeks ago on the surge Restoration Hardware has seen over the pandemic-- Starbucks. I mean, well, these are the kind of existing giants. And what's funny about that is, I think-- and maybe this is a wrong kind of association.

But I think that you would think that supporting digital and supporting sustainability and ESG and all that good stuff would also go hand-in-hand with supporting smaller businesses, supporting indie bookshops. Not necessarily. I don't hear much in here about independent businesses. And that's why, in some ways, this prediction in this report is a little sad to me.

I mean, I think the pandemic has-- we already know it has been a huge just destroyer of independent businesses. You know, one-off restaurants that are not chains, small businesses that are family-owned, whereas big, big, in some ways, fat and bloated, brick and mortar chains that we also thought they were in trouble because of the rush to e-commerce, are going to survive and maybe even thrive.

I mean, we've talked about how Walmart, Target, and Dick's have all seen their e-commerce sales surge during the pandemic. And this report kind of confirms that even young people are happy to buy from those big chains and that suburbanization will benefit those chains. It's just interesting, a little bit counterintuitive.

JEN ROGERS: I have to say, I actually-- I mean, I read it, and it took me away from doing a lot of other work. I liked it. Again, Melody's point, like, who is a millennial, who is the Gen Z, I wanted to know, like, geographically, where these people were from, more racial issues as well in here. I feel like there's a lot that you can tap into.

But this-- and I wish Myles were here, too, because then I wouldn't be. But if you had this suburbanization trend, everybody's moving to the suburbs. But haven't they liked some things about being in an urban city? And I think part of that, they might still like getting everything delivered.

So the bet-- they called out Kohl's and Macy's also in there maybe being able to make a turnaround in here. And I was a little bit more skeptical on that. I know, Dan, you just mentioned the Dick's, but I just see, like, the things that they could be taking with them to the suburbs might hurt a lot of these names that they're calling out.

DAN ROBERTS: Well, it's curbside and BOPUS, right, guys? I'll let Melody say more on that. But man, it's all about BOPUS, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store. And some of these chains have embraced that nice and early, rapidly in the pandemic.

MELODY HAHM: I was speaking to a former executive at Tesla yesterday. And he specifically was talking about this exodus to the suburbs that, of course, it's during a global pandemic that there's that intrigue, right? We can say that there's a good cohort that always wants to, that does want to settle down.

But this sort of-- this obsession and the way we're talking about it, I think it did-- it was birthed out of this idea that all the fun parts of the city, all the magical elements of living in a place like New York City, it's gone, right? Sure, you can have an alfresco dinner. But at the same time, is that going to sustain the rent that has not gone down, especially when all your friends have left, too?

So, again, the FOMO experience is a very real phenomenon, especially with the integration of social. And then call me fatalistic, but remember we used to question, who was Pinterest's demographic? Where are the users of Pinterest? Is it really just moms? Is it really just people who are getting married? That seems to be the case, right?

This note very much sort of highlights the fact that the older millennials are obsessed with Pinterest. Pinterest is actually their number one platform when it comes to purchasing behavior and trying to inform what's trendy, what's not, whereas the younger generation, it's still Instagram. So I do feel as though a lot of those trends that were forecasted, we're seeing come to fruition. And perhaps the data is matching the survey.

JEN ROGERS: We could do a whole segment on just the used clothing part, the Poshmark and ThreadUp and ThreadZ, RealReal part of this note. I thought that was fascinating. All the food stuff is fascinating. Lots of tickers in here if you get your hands on it. A good read.

JEN ROGERS: Welcome back to ""The Final Round."" This is our call of the day. It is a deep dive from Cowen on how Gen Z and millennials are the driving force in scaling digital and sustainability. OK, this thing is 142 pages.

The takeaways are that all of these people are moving to the suburbs. They like to know where their food comes from. And they like to buy used clothes. And they don't trust CNN or Fox.

Melody Hahm, what am I supposed to do with this information? I feel like Amazon was mentioned the most in here. Like, that, to me, I was like, OK, they're all going to shop at Amazon. But they had all these other tickers in there. What did you make of it?

MELODY HAHM: What I have to say, Jen, is this sort of hearkens back to an HBS report in 2017. And Rick Newman and I actually had a very robust debate about this of, what is the purpose of calling someone a millennial? Because a 31-year-old in Oklahoma and a 31-year-old in the suburbs of New York are not the same demographic, right? It just blatantly is comparing apples to oranges.

So to really lump this 18 to 34-year-old bracket-- I understand they kind of parsed through some of the data-- that is particularly troublesome to me. And I think time and time again, you know, this is sort of taking a page out of Piper Sandler's notebook, right? We talked about the Teen Survey at length last week.

And I think one of the things that really interests me from this note, though, is I had no idea that the generation after Gen Z, those born after 2011, are called Gen Alpha. And those who are born-- who are going to be born in 2025 to 2039, they'll be called Gen Beta. My understanding from the ""Atlantic"" article was that people born during this era is, they will be called generation C, after coronavirus.

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: There are growing concerns that cyber-attacks could threaten the integrity of the outcome. Cities across the country, as well as contractors who run their voting systems, have all been exposed to ransomware attacks over the last several months. And to discuss the evolving threat, we're joined by Sanjay Poonen. He is the chief operating officer of VMware. And Sanjay, it's great to have you on today.

SANJAY POONEN: Thank you, Akiko. Pleasure to be with you today.

AKIKO FUJITA: You've got really good visibility in this particular issue. So let's get right to the questions around election security here. What is the biggest cyber threat as you see it as we countdown to November 3?

SANJAY POONEN: Yeah, Akiko. We are emerging, VMware, as one of the leaders now in cybersecurity as we're making massive investments in this area, several acquisitions. Obviously, we want to see a, you know, a fair election. And we've got to obviously worry about the nation-state actors that will try to disrupt one of the world's biggest democracies in action.

And that's always going to be something that the powers that be, whether it's in the federal government or the state, need to be very much aware of. And they come in through a variety of distinct ways they can hack. And people have to first off do sensible things with their email and stuff like that. Not send out username, passwords. Part of the reasons things-- people were able to hack into folks' email last time were things that are very repeatable by common citizens.

And in addition to that, all of these, you know, election equipment are endpoints that need to be secure, whether it's laptops, tablets, phones. A variety of different endpoints. And we play a lot in endpoint security. So we work with both commercial and the federal government in making sure that those systems are secure.

Story continues

And then there's a lot of other things that today can flow into the cloud. Cloud security is another area where, when you put data in the cloud, you've got to protect yourself from the type of possible places where there can be breaches. So whether it's the network, whether it's endpoint in the cloud, these are all areas that, well, most of the time, I'm confident with the cybersecurity expertise that exists both in the industry and the government. We will protect, you know, these systems from the bad guys.

AKIKO FUJITA: You talk about state actors looking to disrupt the election. I mean, that's what we were talking about in 2016, particularly with the attacks out of Russia. How do you think the threat has evolved, though? What has changed over the last several years, as you see it, in terms of the sophistication of the attacks?

SANJAY POONEN: Yeah, I think-- Listen, the surface area has gotten bigger. I mean, in the past you were just worried about smaller networks, fewer endpoints. But now with mobile and cloud, the surface area has gotten bigger. And when you have the surface area bigger-- As much as there's investment in the security industry, the one thing that's growing as fast or even faster than investment in the security industry is the amount of investment the bad guys are doing in finding ways.

Phishing attacks are incredibly creative. I mean, people have been sending out, you know, phishing attacks promising a vaccine in an email. You click the email, and you are baited into something that you don't want to be doing. So there's always going to be those types of things. The folks are looking for newer and newer ways.

But if there's one thing that I feel confident about, it is the research in this area, the smart people that are working on this collectively. There is a commitment as a village in the security industry to band together, share best practices, you know? And even through this though time with the pandemic, I think that the technologies have gotten stronger.

It's one of these things like sicknesses, that you can't say that you'll never hit a breach again. You know, it's sort of saying like you'll never get sick again. But you're doing more and more, just like, you know, in the health care industry, to operate on data. The more that analytics is operating on the data-- Just as the way there could be a possible cure cancer or Alzheimer's disease is because you're reasoning over DNA sequencing and so on and so forth. A big part of our effort is behavioral analytics and large amount of data crunching to prevent a future security breach.

AKIKO FUJITA: And on that issue, Sanjay, you've been quite acquisitory. I think I counted three different acquisitions, particularly in the security space, most notably Carbon Black, as well as Lastline. What's the growth potential that you see there? I mean, certainly cybersecurity, a growing space, but also an increasingly competitive one.

SANJAY POONEN: Yeah, we-- There's 5,000 vendors in security space, and they're all, you know, I'm sure very good. But you can't go, Doctor, Doctor, and ask her, how do you stay healthy? And she says, you've got to have 5,000 tablets. It would take you weeks and months to be able, even if you were eating them every 30 seconds.

So we felt, as a large infrastructure security player-- the sixth largest software company, about $11 billion in revenue-- that we owed it to security industry to make security different, baked more into the diet or baked more into the infrastructure. We call that intrinsic security. The analysts call that zero trust.

And in doing so, there's three or four key pillars that we're focused on. Network security, endpoint and workload security, and cloud security. And then all of that data coming together in an analytics telemetry. So those are areas we've made acquisitions. Not just the last year. Seven, eight years ago, we got in the network security space with Nicira. We've added to that.

And we feel like right now, with what we've done with Carbon Black, Octarine, and Lastline-- they're the three most recent acquisitions we've done in the last 12 months-- we are going to be a player to stay. We have a billion-dollar security business. It's growing. 20,000 customers.

And we're seeing the landscape, you know, kind of consolidating. I think that some of the existing security players have hit a wall, even the big ones. And that creates an opportunity for creative new vendors at scale. We have tremendous amount of scale. Half a million customers, many of whom are asking us to do more on security. We think the, you know, the platform's ripe for this type of innovation. And the feedback I've been getting from CISOs is very positive on VMware strategy

AKIKO FUJITA: Sanjay, the last conversation we had, we were talking about just the digital acceleration, and how that has really changed the way in which all the companies work. But particularly with VMware, the transition that you have gone to-- gone through. There's been a lot of talk about tech companies who are transitioning from work from home, allowing employees to permanently work from home. But also, those who are moving out of state having to take a pay cut as a result of no longer having to pay the high rents that are in, for example, the Bay Area.

There's a report out from the Journal, I believe, that talks about potentially for employees of VMware, it would be an 18% cut moving from San Francisco to a place like Denver. How are you viewing the options in front of you on that issue? And are you really confident that those employees will in fact stick around even with the pay cut?

SANJAY POONEN: Yeah. VMware goal is to be the best company in tech in terms of how our employees think of us. We've been consistently rated one of the best companies to work for. Why? Because there's an incredible uniqueness to our culture. We're an innovator on one hand, and we're customer-obsessed. And our employees, I believe, are the best employees on the planet.

Now, as we do that, we don't think the only employees are going to be the ones in the Bay Area. Certainly, the roots of this company are Palo Alto. But I'll give you an example. I recently had the opportunity to promote a wonderfully talented lady inside our company to the head of global demand gen and marketing.

She was based in Australia. And she was thinking about the disruptive move to come to the Bay Area. And in the past, we may have had this role be a headquartered role in the Bay Area. I told her, once the pandemic happened, you can work from Sydney. And she's very effective at doing that job. And, you know, as the pandemic eases she may get to travel some. But she's very effective. We just hired another person out of AWS and out of Google.

We want this to be the best place for people to work at. And as we do that, they'll make their choices. Some of them will decide to move, potentially, to other areas for a variety of reasons. Some of it might be housing costs. We have an internal tool that will allow people to make those choices with a calculator that can decide, you know, what are the trade-offs. And we want to make this one that's fair and equitable.

And as they do that, I think we we're not seeing anything but positivity from our customer base. And in fact, we're finding employees from many of these other great companies want to joint VMware. So this is an opportunity for VMware to get stronger, to get creative in thinking about what the future of work looks like. And that's our intent over the long run.

AKIKO FUJITA: Sanjay Poonen, the chief operating officer at VMware. Good to talk to you.

So we felt, as a large infrastructure security player-- the sixth largest software company, about $11 billion in revenue-- that we owed it to security industry to make security different, baked more into the diet or baked more into the infrastructure. We call that intrinsic security. The analysts call that zero trust.

And in doing so, there's three or four key pillars that we're focused on. Network security, endpoint and workload security, and cloud security. And then all of that data coming together in an analytics telemetry. So those are areas we've made acquisitions. Not just the last year. Seven, eight years ago, we got in the network security space with Nicira. We've added to that.

And we feel like right now, with what we've done with Carbon Black, Octarine, and Lastline-- they're the three most recent acquisitions we've done in the last 12 months-- we are going to be a player to stay. We have a billion-dollar security business. It's growing. 20,000 customers.

And we're seeing the landscape, you know, kind of consolidating. I think that some of the existing security players have hit a wall, even the big ones. And that creates an opportunity for creative new vendors at scale. We have tremendous amount of scale. Half a million customers, many of whom are asking us to do more on security. We think the, you know, the platform's ripe for this type of innovation. And the feedback I've been getting from CISOs is very positive on VMware strategy

AKIKO FUJITA: Sanjay, the last conversation we had, we were talking about just the digital acceleration, and how that has really changed the way in which all the companies work. But particularly with VMware, the transition that you have gone to-- gone through. There's been a lot of talk about tech companies who are transitioning from work from home, allowing employees to permanently work from home. But also, those who are moving out of state having to take a pay cut as a result of no longer having to pay the high rents that are in, for example, the Bay Area.

There's a report out from the Journal, I believe, that talks about potentially for employees of VMware, it would be an 18% cut moving from San Francisco to a place like Denver. How are you viewing the options in front of you on that issue? And are you really confident that those employees will in fact stick around even with the pay cut?

SANJAY POONEN: Yeah. VMware goal is to be the best company in tech in terms of how our employees think of us. We've been consistently rated one of the best companies to work for. Why? Because there's an incredible uniqueness to our culture. We're an innovator on one hand, and we're customer-obsessed. And our employees, I believe, are the best employees on the planet.

Now, as we do that, we don't think the only employees are going to be the ones in the Bay Area. Certainly, the roots of this company are Palo Alto. But I'll give you an example. I recently had the opportunity to promote a wonderfully talented lady inside our company to the head of global demand gen and marketing.

She was based in Australia. And she was thinking about the disruptive move to come to the Bay Area. And in the past, we may have had this role be a headquartered role in the Bay Area. I told her, once the pandemic happened, you can work from Sydney. And she's very effective at doing that job. And, you know, as the pandemic eases she may get to travel some. But she's very effective. We just hired another person out of AWS and out of Google.

We want this to be the best place for people to work at. And as we do that, they'll make their choices. Some of them will decide to move, potentially, to other areas for a variety of reasons. Some of it might be housing costs. We have an internal tool that will allow people to make those choices with a calculator that can decide, you know, what are the trade-offs. And we want to make this one that's fair and equitable.

And as they do that, I think we we're not seeing anything but positivity from our customer base. And in fact, we're finding employees from many of these other great companies want to joint VMware. So this is an opportunity for VMware to get stronger, to get creative in thinking about what the future of work looks like. And that's our intent over the long run.

AKIKO FUJITA: Sanjay Poonen, the chief operating officer at VMware. Good to talk to you.

473,2020-10-12T16:50:05+00:00,Polish Online Retailer Allegro Surges 63% in Market Debut,"(Bloomberg) --

Poland’s newest stock listing was a roaring success on its first day of trading, taking over as the biggest stock on the country’s main exchange and adding almost two-thirds in market value.

Allegro.eu SA shares jumped 63% to close at 70 zloty in its first trading session in Warsaw on Monday, lifting the company’s value to 72 billion zloty ($19 billion). The firm and its private-equity investors priced the IPO at the top end of a marketed range, cashing in on soaring demand for digital sales as consumers stuck at home indulge in virtual retail therapy.

“Allegro provides high exposure to the fast-growing Polish e-commerce market and draws comparison to Amazon, which may be an attractive investment option for foreign investors, who took up most of the shares in offering,” Jaroslaw Niedzielewski, head of investments for Investors TFI mutual fund, said in an email. “But the scale of the price jump is a shock.”

Before the trading start, analysts at Bernstein estimated Allegro’s enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be about 37, above the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, but below MercadoLibre Inc. and European fashion retailer Zalando SE, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Trading volume on Allegro shares reached about 4 billion zloty, a record daily volume for single stock in Warsaw. It stood for almost 80% of total equity traded value on the exchange on Monday.

“Wide gains are a combination of a general surge in tech stocks this year and emerging markets e-commerce opportunity, which long-term is a good place to be,” Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman said in email. Even so, “such a move may soften after as there are several question marks about growth and margins.”

The company is betting on the continued expansion of online shopping in Poland, a market of 38 million people and one of the European Union’s most resilient economies. Allegro is touting lower fees, a loyalty program with free deliveries, and high number of local merchants to fend off global competition. Amazon.com Inc. is still selling its products to Poles from Germany, while China-based AliExpress relies on lengthy shipping processes.

Story continues

“Yes, there was component of surprise,” Allegro’s Chief Executive Officer Francois Nuyts said in an interview with Bloomberg TV when asked about the price jump.

During the opening ceremony at the Warsaw bourse, CEO also pledged more investment and hiring. A new wave of coronavirus infections in Poland may end up benefiting the firm, further accelerating the switch to online purchases. In the first half of the year, the company’s sales and net income rose about 50% on year as the platform became the premier selling venue for many smaller shops cut off from their clients during lockdown.

Bernstein expects Allegro to have plenty of opportunities to expand to broader Eastern European markets, which are more fragmented and easier to scale up. Still, the company hasn’t announced such plans, saying that it wants to keep its focus on Polish consumers. Even so, the CEO said he’s “reasonably convinced” the firm will reach customers outside of Poland eventually.

Index-Driven Demand

Allegro is now the country’s largest listed company and will be added swiftly to major equity indexes. Inclusion in Warsaw’s WIG20 benchmark was announced on Monday, and will happen after the market closes Wednesday. Its anticipated addition to MSCI gauges at a later date may also fuel demand. After Monday’s surge, Allegro is worth more than twice the Polish benchmark’s current leader, game developer CD Projekt SA.

“Local investors saw Nasdaq-level valuations in an IPO for the first time,” Investors TFI’s Niedzielewski said. “But their allocation is much below expected weight of Allegro in WIG20 index, which probably triggers more buying.”

While fellow online shopping emporium THG Holdings Ltd. posted one of the best first-day pops in London for at least two years in September, floats on European exchanges have fared less well over the past two weeks. Military supplier Hensoldt AG, Russia’s state-owned tanker operator Sovcomflot OAO, Lithuanian electric utility AB Ignitis Grupe, camper-van maker Knaus Tabbert AG and China Yangtze Power Co. all slumped in their debut sessions.

The Warsaw Stock Exchange delayed Allegro’s opening by 15 minutes to avoid any potential overflow of its trading system, as a substantial number of shares in the IPO were sold to a fragmented group of more than 36,000 retail buyers. Allegro’s private equity owners -- Cinven, Permira and Mid Europa Partners’ funds -- remain the controlling shareholders in the platform and pledged not to sell more shares within 180 days following the debut. Allegro will publish third-quarter earnings on Nov. 26.

475,2020-10-12T16:36:52+00:00,This holiday season will be like 'putting a rat down a boa's mouth': retail CEO,"As the former CEO of Collective Brands and Cole Haan — and current CEO of new consumer-focused SPAC Empower — Matt Rubel has pretty much seen it all during a 30-year career in retail.

Well, that was until what is shaping up to be an insanely chaotic holiday shopping season for retailers and consumers thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even Rubel isn’t 100% certain about how retailers will fare, but he is sure of one thing — it will be a “vibrant” few months for the sector.

“It will be like a rat through a boa come that November-December time period,” Rubel said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. “Hence people are trying to pull things forward with October promotions to drive things through. The direct-to-consumer infrastructure is going to be stressed in a way that you have never seen before. It will be a very vibrant Christmas, especially if stimulus comes through at the same time. I’m not worried about total demand.” Mask-wearing shoppers make their way down a concourse at the American Dream Mall, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2020, in East Rutherford, New Jersey, after the megamall reopened to the public. The complex was set to have a grand opening for dozens of retailers on March 19. But the mall shut down completely on March 16, as the country began to go on lockdown due tp concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens)

Sensing the potential for shipping and out-of-stock chaos in December, numerous big-name retailers have pulled their key promotions and events into October and early November. Owing to the pandemic, Amazon’s Prime Day was moved to Oct. 13 to Oct. 14 instead of being held per the usual in mid-July. Three of Amazon’s chief rivals are holding ‘anti Prime Day’ events of their own this week. Best Buy will hold an ‘Early Black Friday’ event, Walmart is having a ‘Big Sale’ event and Target is coming in with a ‘Deals Day’ sales.

The goal of retailers holding these sales events now is twofold.

First is to drive sales today before an uncertain presidential election outcome, get products shipped to people’s homes and be done with them until after they return with gift cards post Christmas. By doing so, it will keep stress off an already taxed e-commerce pandemic supply chain.

The other is to keep shoppers safe during a pandemic that is very much still raging across the country. No retailer wants to be blamed for putting consumers at risk by offering a 70-inch TV for $5 on Black Friday ... in-store only.

Story continues

“There is a concern around delay of shipments, quite frankly because people want to make sure those gifts are there for the holiday,” ICSC CEO Tom McGee told The First Trade.

While chaotic, McGee joins Rubel’s prediction of it being a solid holiday shopping season.

The ICSC recently forecast that holiday sales will increase 1.9% year over year. E-commerce sales are seen rising 25%.

477,2020-10-09T14:32:00+00:00,10 Best ETFs for 2020: The Battle At the Top Tightens,"This year has been a crazy one for investors seeking the best ETFs to buy.

First, the novel coronavirus took a heavy toll on countless stocks. Then we saw a nice recovery in the companies that stood to benefit most from changes in the “new normal.” Meanwhile, industries like air travel and entertainment experienced (and continue to experience) great pain. All of this managed to throw countless exchange-traded funds into limbo, as their general design to hold numerous stocks centralized around a specific theme made some of them particularly vulnerable.

But the madness didn’t stop there.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

More recently, tech stocks took a beating shortly before the first debate leading into the Presidential election. Then President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19.

Now, with the election quickly approaching, we’re still trapped in a period of uncertainty. Will Biden win? Or will Trump stay in charge? Either victory could boost some stocks and ETFs, and tank others. Oh, and don’t forget, an asteroid might hit Earth before we even get to that Nov. 3 election date.

While that last bit is somewhat of a joke, it reflects the overall essence of 2020 quite nicely. Just when you expect that things couldn’t get any more crazy this year, they seemingly always do.

But, thankfully, InvestorPlace.com’s best ETFs for 2020 contest has plenty of winners that should hold strong no matter what happens. It also has a few losers too.

The 7 Best New Stocks From 2020 to Buy Now

With all of that said, let’s take a look at how each of these funds has performed (in ascending order from best to worst) through the end of September:

Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO) Global X Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:CLOU) SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:XITK) Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) The Communication Services SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLC) AdvisorShares Vice ETF (NASDAQ:ACT) iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWO) Consumer Staples Select Sector Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP) The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ) U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS)

There’s not much time left in the year, but a few of these ETFs still might manage to run higher.

Best ETFs for 2020: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) Best ETFs for 2020: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO)

Investor:Tom Taulli
Expense Ratio: 0.6%, or $60 annually per $10,000 invested
Performance Through Q3: 58%

In the end, there can be only one winner of the best ETFs contest. It looks like Tom Taulli’s pick, the IPO ETF, will be the one.

While that might sound like a dramatic reference to the cult-classic film Highlander (“there can be only one!”), it seems fairly accurate. Its current performance (78% year to date) is already significantly greater than the 58% YTD figure recorded at the end of September. At its current level, it has performed nearly 20% greater than CLOU, the No. 2 ETF in the contest.

As impressive as that may be, and with its victory seemingly secure, does it have any more room to run?

The coronavirus helped power IPO at the start of the year as social distancing initiatives led to the breakout success of Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), one of its top holdings. But with clearer expectations developing for the “new normal” ahead, are continued gains guaranteed?

Taulli thinks IPO has what it takes to continue its placement among the best ETFs in the years ahead. While he acknowledges that the IPO market is getting a bit “frothy,” he thinks the trend will continue for some time. According to Taulli, the ETF is a strong way to play the current popularity of IPOs: “when it comes to investing in IPOs, it’s a good idea to have diversification — this is what the IPO fund provides”

Investor:Dana Blankenhorn
Expense Ratio: 0.68%
Performance Through Q3: 47%

The overall success of cloud stocks (what the CLOU ETF specializes in) this year is undeniable. Again, the pandemic amplified much of that success, but cloud computing is a future-looking theme that was bound for significant relevance and gains without the virus catalyst factored in.

But even the titans must fall from time-to-time. According to Dana Blankenhorn, while the CLOU ETF has been a winner this year, its performance more recently has been ugly. Even so, the ETF is in the No. 2 spot of the contest, and there’s plenty of reason to think it will endure in the months and years ahead:

The companies in CLOU, and those that might be added, are in good position to build the Machine Internet. Anything whose condition can be sensed, calculated, and adjusted will become a networked computer over the next decade. More internet demand will come from machines than from people using them.

That’s as good of a long-term catalyst as any. Just don’t expect CLOU to edge out IPO as the winner for best ETFs. But in the big picture, as a longer-term investment, Blankenhorn remains positive on the ETF’s outlook.

SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (XITK) Best ETFs for 2020: SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (XITK)

Source: Shutterstock

Investor:Bret Kenwell
Expense Ratio: 0.45%
Performance Through Q3: 43%

As its namesake suggests, the XITK ETF focuses on companies involved in innovative technologies. And, as you’re likely realizing by now, the new virus has helped propel many innovative companies since their technologies were adopted much more quickly than expected.

Its holdings include the aforementioned Zoom Communications and other “coronavirus stocks” like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). Although the virus boost will fade in time, most of its holdings should retain their relevance in the years ahead. This is largely what makes Bret Kenwell think that it will remain one of the best ETFs heading into the new normal. He also notes the fund’s diversity as a positive aspect that sets it apart from other growth-based ETFs:

Diversification can be a negative in some cases. In the case of the XITK ETF though, it helps remove any single-stock risk. That’s a benefit in my mind. That’s because growth stocks are likely to rally or fall together, but any one stock could really ruin the fund’s performance if it had too large of a weighting.

According to Kenwell, if growth stocks continue to rise, then the XITK ETF will also run higher. If he’s right, this might be the dark horse of the race. Watch out, IPO!

Performance Through Q3: 27%

Our reader’s choice for the contest, QQQ, is always a solid bet. In fact, it won the best ETFs contest in a prior year. It continues to demonstrate its viability as an investment, currently ranked No. 4 in the contest.

Part of what makes it attractive is that its holdings include the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq. While it’s not explicitly a tech stock ETF, it holds behemoths like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a part of its top holdings.

Usually this is a great thing — and for much of the pandemic it has been a winner. But, more recently, tech stocks took a dive and QQQ has started to stutter. I wouldn’t expect QQQ to surpass the likes of IPO, CLOU or the XITK ETF this year, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not one of the best ETFs out there today.

If you have a positive outlook on the world of tech and an economic recovery in general, then there’s no reason to lose faith despite the recent dip.

The Communication Services ETF (XLC) Best ETFs for 2020: The Communication Services ETF (XLC)

Investor:Todd Shriber
Expense Ratio: 0.13%
Performance Through Q3: 10%

A winning theme this year (as with most years in recent times) has been tech. But many of the companies in the newly formed Communication Services sector are also intertwined with these tech-based themes. As such, Todd Shriber’s pick, XLC, has managed to chart a 10% rise this year. That success comes despite all the challenges induced by the pandemic.

The gains for XLC might not be as monstrous as the top three picks in the contest, but there’s still immense promise for its holdings in the years ahead. Holdings like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) aren’t going to disappear anytime soon. And video game plays Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision-Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) have only gotten better as more people cling to video games for entertainment rather than bars and in-person socialization.

Shriber thinks the holiday season could bolster its videogame holdings and companies like Facebook and Alphabet will overcome political challenges, all of which could help it climb a little higher by the end of 2020.

Investor:InvestorPlace Staff
Expense Ratio: 0.99%
Performance Through Q3: 4%

The InvestorPlace Staff never assumed that the ACT ETF would win the contest, but they did see reason for optimism beyond a victory.

As one of the few ETFs that focus on sin stocks, ACT holds marijuana, booze and tobacco companies. While tobacco and marijuana stocks haven’t been hot players this year, some booze stocks have managed to climb higher. In particular, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) has marked impressive gains this year on the popularity of its new seltzer booze brand “Truly Hard Seltzer.” This has helped keep ACT afloat while much of its marijuana holdings continue to suffer.

7 Sin Stocks to Buy Today For Tempting Dividends

ACT won’t win this year’s contest. But the success of booze amid the coronavirus pandemic and the outcome of the election might ultimately power it a little higher this year and further in the future. It’s certainly worth keeping an eye on if you’re interested in sin stocks.

Investor:Ian Bezek
Expense Ratio: 0.24%
Performance Through Q3: 2%

Although Ian Bezek’s pick for this year’s best ETFs contest had a rough start in 2020, he still has faith in its comeback. Citing what he calls the “small-cap advantage,” Bezek argues that small-cap stocks generally out-perform large-cap stocks, and while the fund’s smaller holdings have suffered, when the economy recovers, they will soar again.

As Bezek notes, just looking at its YTD performance alone is a little deceiving. Given the selloff in March, the ETF has already climbed more than 70% higher back from its lows. And he thinks that once economic conditions start to normalize, we might expect IWO to rise even higher.

It’s all a matter of perspective:

In owning the IWO ETF, you get exposure to some of the most innovative companies in the country. And at only 5% more expensive than last year, IWO is still a reasonably priced way to get that exposure. It certainly beats chasing many of the software or e-commerce stocks that have already doubled or tripled this year.

If you think that argument by Bezek holds muster, then you might consider IWO a great play from a longer-term view.

Playing it safe usually isn’t very exciting, but sometimes it can also prove beneficial in an economic downturn.

As mentioned earlier, 2020 has been a crazy year so far. And the upcoming U.S. presidential election aims to make it even crazier. That’s part of the appeal of a fund like XLP — it offers stability.

After all, even in desperate times, consumers will always purchase “essential” items. That has always been the appeal to consumer staples stocks, the investment theme XLP focuses on. And it’s largely why Thune picked it for the contest.

But, while Thune thinks it’s still a wise choice, he also points out another lesson he’s learned in the process. Old investment theses don’t necessarily apply to the new normal. Instead, he sees “tech as the new defensive play:”

While it may be foolish to say those four most dangerous words, ‘this time it’s different,’ it’s also foolish to assume that the same defensive strategies will work ad infinitum … 2020 was certainly not a normal year, but it does provide a glimpse into what the future holds for capital markets. And investors are wise to take note.

The 10 Top Stocks to Buy For Q4

In summary, the head honchos in tech also demonstrate significant resilience. Maybe it’s time to stop looking at XLP as the only go-to defensive ETF on the market?

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) Best ETFs for 2020: The Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)

Investor:Tim Biggam
Expense Ratio: 0.75%
Performance Through Q3: -43%

As seen with the ACT ETF earlier, this hasn’t been a strong year for marijuana stocks. But while ACT managed to stay in the green this year, bolstered by its holdings in the booze industry, the MJ ETF ended up tanking.

Given that it’s only focused on cannabis-based stocks, this should be no surprise. According to Biggam, the market for CBD and other products is oversaturated and investors lost faith in some of the hype machines that stormed higher in 2019. But as glum as that may be, he also thinks this is a great opportunity.

Biggam sees the MJ ETF making a comeback towards the end of this year and into 2021. He thinks the release of new cannabis-based beverages and further developments in legalization efforts in the U.S. will prove strong catalysts moving forward. As such, he sees now as a good opportunity to get into MJ as a fund with a high-dividend yield at a cheap price.

U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) Best ETFs for 2020: U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)

Investor:Vince Martin
Expense Ratio: 0.6%
Performance Through Q3: -45%

Out of all the picks in this contest, JETS has consistently performed the worst. As a fund with holdings based solely in the airline industry, it has done about as well as you might expect during a global pandemic. But according to Vince Martin — the one who picked it — the impact of the pandemic managed to highlight some of the other issues influencing the industry.

Martin says while it’s tempting to hop on JETS now and hope for a recovery in the long term, there’s reason this investment thesis falls apart: “In practice … cyclical stocks usually aren’t cheap enough at the top. With economic damage from the pandemic likely to linger, it’s going to take years simply for investors to get comfortable with the macroeconomic risk in the sector.”

When you combine this reality with the fact that the industry was poorly prepared for a potential threat that it had already anticipated (a pandemic), it’s clear why Martin is less optimistic about JETS as a comeback ETF for 2021. Only time will tell if the industry can regain its former strength. But for now, Martin suggests waiting on the sidelines.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JARED BLIKRE: I want to thank everybody for joining us for our fourth Yahoo Finance Premium webinar, Trading Election Year Odds and Managing Risk Amid Rising Uncertainty. I'm Jared Blikre.

And what a bout of uncertainty we've had recently. By October 6th yesterday, we'd had not one, but two October surprises. So we're going to be covering the following. What do these latest events mean for the markets? What happens with a contested election? What does a blue wave mean for your portfolio?

And to help us, we're soon going to be joined by Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist and senior VP at LPL Financial. He is a chartered market technician, CMT. So we're going to be covering lots of technicals, lots of fundamentals, lots of macro policy stuff, portfolio management, the Fed, and of course, lots and lots of stats.

We're also going to be demonstrating some of the features of our Yahoo Finance Premium service. This is how you can use it to find stocks that show signs of promising returns and also use it to analyze your portfolio and finetune it.

And now just a few notes on our webinar software, you're going to be able to interact with us in real time. That's because we're running Blue Jeans Secure Video Conferencing Platform, now part of Verizon.

And we're going to be running polls for the next 45 minutes, which you will see at the right hand tab of your screen. You can post questions at any time using that same tab at the right of your screen. And you can use your real name or just post anonymously.

Story continues

So, also, this is how you control the size of the various windows here. At the bottom left of your screen, you're going to see little sliders. And that's how you make the presenting screen bigger or smaller, as well as the video boxes for me and Ryan.

So let's get started. And I want to start out with a poll. Again, those are going to be on the right-hand side of your screen. And the first one is, the second most volatile month for stocks since 1990 is-- is it February, May, August, September, October, November, or December? We're going to have the results in a few minutes. So just make those selections now.

And I'm going to bring in Ryan Detrick. Ryan, thank you for joining us here. Great to have you. And I just wanted to begin-- I think you're muted there, Ryan. I just want to begin with market analysis because we have had some crazy price action over the last few days. Ryan, are you able to hear us?

RYAN DETRICK: Yes, I guess you guys muted me. And I didn't realize I had to unmute myself. So chalk that up for the first mistake, but that's the only mistake I'm going to make in 45 minutes. So yes, thank you for having me here.

JARED BLIKRE: All right. Everybody--

RYAN DETRICK: Appreciate it.

JARED BLIKRE: As I like to say, everybody gets one of those a month. Not your fault, anyway. But I want to take a look, and I'm going to share my screen here. We're going to take a look at the Qs. This is the ETF that tracks the NASDAQ 100. And we saw a really big reversal yesterday. Of course, we're up again today.

And just looking at this chart here, this is the daily candlestick chart. We've got some moving averages, the 20, the 50, the 200. It goes back to March so we can see the lows down here. It's been quite a run, but we've been in this consolidation for the last, what, six weeks now. What are you making of this latest price action, Ryan?

RYAN DETRICK: Well, I mean, the Qs, Jared, clearly, they're the leader of 2020. We know that, right? And just before this recent sell-off that we had, the Qs were more than 30% above that 200-day moving average, a geeky way of saying, that's an extremely stretched market. The most it's ever been stretched since when? Since 2000.

So you hear 2000, you start thinking, oh my goodness, bad stuff coming around the corner potentially. But we don't think that's the case because, again, you've got the Qs now just consolidating, catching its breath.

And we're going to talk about other parts of the market, but I'm not only looking at semiconductors. I mean, semiconductors are just a big part of technology in general. Relative strength versus the S&P, semiconductors are breaking out. Earnings have been strong in technology in general.

Now the Qs, it's not all technology, but believe me, it's a lot of technology. So, overall, we still say stick with who brought us to the dance, right? Stick with who brought us to the party. And that is some of the big cap names, some of the tech names. And let's not forget, we're in a low growth, low inflation, low rates world. That's probably not going to change the next 12 to 18 months, in our opinion.

And historically speaking, that is a tailwind for what? For growth because investors reach for growth. So you've got these tailwinds, in our view. They just got ahead of themselves. I mean, that's the truth. They got ahead of themselves because of the pandemic. But that's a group, you know, we still like. We still think the next 12 to 18 months will probably do pretty well for investors really.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, we've just got to get through these next four weeks. But I want to get to some seasonality here. Because that's a big part of the reason why a lot of people are here. Let's pull up election year seasonality.

And we're going to pull a-- we're going to take a question from the audience here. This is from Bryant. And he's asking, what does history say about the market returns from October to December in election years and the returns in Q1 the following year? So we have this chart out that you have prepared. Any people might remember it from Twitter because I've seen it making the rounds here. Can you set it up for us?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah, I mean, you know, so there's different ways to break it down. And this one, I broke it down by election year and if a president's up for re-election. The bottom line here is, ahead of the election and during an election year, October, the very month of October, is actually the worst month of the year on average.

Now you can see on the chart there, when you're up for re-election, maybe there's a little bit more sideways consolidation. But still, it's kind of the way it works out. It makes sense. People a little skittish ahead of the election. There's some reasons maybe to sell.

And we wouldn't be shocked at all if that were the case once again. We've got a lot of-- we've had the sell-off, I guess, in September, now more volatility. And it's amazing how much we've bounced back today versus what just happened yesterday, 24 hours ago.

But, you know, you talk about the fourth. I know we're going to get some other slides coming up. But the fourth quarter historically is a pretty good quarter. It's pretty good during an election year also. The reality of the fact is the market tends to be weak until that election. Then whoever wins, right-- Republican, Democrat-- whatever usually happens, once that-- the market hates uncertainty. We've all heard that time and time again.

What we've been telling our LPL advisors is, use any weakness as an opportunity to potentially have that end of year rally that you tend to see more often than not during an election year. And that's what we're kind of expecting to play out once again because of the underlying fundamentals of this economy.

They're not great, but they're improving and earnings are looking pretty good next year. So those are all big positives, we think, that continue to be a buyer of dips in this current market environment.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, you got to imagine a lot of those comps are going to be pretty interesting over the following fourth quarters at least. But we brought up another slide here. And this kind of builds on what you were saying. In year 4, there's actually-- we usually have gains in all four quarters. So what is this? How does this fit with your other work.

RYAN DETRICK: I guess we didn't have a gain the first quarter of this year, though, did we? [CHUCKLES] We've been down 20%, then up 20% the second quarter, and another big gain in the third quarter. But what we like to point out is the average. And what's the old saying? There's no such thing as-- you know, there's no such thing as average really if think about it.

There's the statistician that put his head in a bucket of ice and his feet in the oven. They said, how do you feel? He goes, well, on average, I feel pretty good, right? I mean, he's still-- I'm aware there's no such thing as average.

But still, the average fourth quarter gains about 4%, now you can see on the screen there, when you break it down by presidential cycle, the fourth year of the presidential cycle, S&P gains about 2%. You say oh, that's kind of weaker than normal. Maybe there's some truth to that, but it's actually higher 82% of the time. Just a couple of big drops kind of skew things.

So bigger picture, as uncertain as all elections usually are-- and this year, specifically this one-- the fourth quarter of election year is higher 82% of the time, which, as you see, you know, is one of the more likely quarters out of the four-year cycle out of 16 quarters to actually be higher. And we think that probably plays out again here in 2020.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and we've seen-- well, just four years ago we had that meteoric rise after President Trump was elected. And that's after S&P futures crashed limit down the night of the election. But he seemed to be banking on a different outcome or result.

But I want to move on to our poll results. So the second most volatile month for stocks since 1990 is-- the biggest winner here is October, followed by September. In actuality, it's November. And can we put up the October volatility slide that we have here, guys?

And this shows-- this is going to show the average VIX performance since inception in 1990 through 2019. And we can see September, October, November all elevated. So pretty close there, guys. And Ryan, what is this representing to you? 'Cause we're not just talking about election year here. We're talking about this pocket of volatility-- September, October, November. Well, how do you interpret this?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, you know, you had spectacular crashes in October. We all know '29. We all know '87, 2008. You know, October 2011 was one of the greatest monthly gains we've ever seen. So October, it gets a bad rap in my view.

If you look at average performance, it's about the seventh best month on average for stocks. So it's not great, but it's not this terrible month either, but it is volatile. You've got the VIX there, you know, that shows the high VIX usually. You also have more 1% moves either up or down in the month of October than any other month.

And believe me, you can ask 10 people why October? You know, I know a lot of hedge funds in-- believe me, there is no hedge funds back in the crash of '29. Let's get that clear. But now you've got a lot of hedge funds that fiscal year ends the end of September.

You know, the fourth quarter is normally strong, so maybe some skittishness. And then you get to the feel good time of November and December. It's tough to pinpoint one reason why the reality those investors that we've been telling our more than 17,000 LPL Advisors. We say, listen, it is what it is. October can be volatile. You get your October surprise-- and we've got a couple of them so far.

And let's hope maybe the next October surprise is maybe positive news on a vaccine or major-- more therapeutic breakthroughs. That'd be a nice October surprise, wouldn't it? But still, it's just kind of one of those things that you don't want to ignore. I mean, Mark Twain, you know, said history does repeat, but it rhymes. Well, a volatile October is what we tend to see more often than not, and that's something to be aware of as investors.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. And I think that came from ""Pudd'nhead Wilson."" All right, we're going to go to another poll here.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. He steals all the good quotes. I say Mark Twain, I think he gets credit for all of them. He and, you know, some of the famous generals, they didn't really say them, but I give him credit. [LAUGHS]

JARED BLIKRE: Sounds good. Here is our second poll-- how long have you been trading stocks? One year or less? One to three years? Three to 10 years? 10 years or more? We ask this at every webinar just trying to gauge the audience in the room, and what your experience level is with stocks.

So now we're going to take another question here. This one's from Hank. ""What industry or industries have better value before or after the election?"" And I'm just going to start with this one. And the way I see it is September was a month-- we had a big sell off and then consolidation.

And I think that was simply repricing election risk that really haven't been priced in up until then. And that's one of the things we've seen over the last four years, I would say. What the first time I really noticed this was Brexit-- how fast things get repriced in the market.

You know, we're coming off the fastest bear market in history. We've-- at various times, this has been the fastest bull market in history. And what we're seeing now is possible expansion of the yield curve. And so that would be kind of the blue wave that we have Democrats in Congress, both houses, as well as presidents. And if that's a play, you're going to have an expanding yield curve, and you're going to bet on infrastructure. So that's materials, industrials.

And we saw those sectors-- we've seen them come into rotation in fits and starts throughout this entire rally. But I would say more so recently. And Ryan, what are your thoughts on this?

RYAN DETRICK: Oh, we agree, not to mention small caps. I mean, small caps and other kind of get the economy going better times ahead potentially. And they they've started to show some leadership. But I kind of mentioned earlier, you know, we like technology. That's where a lot of the growth is coming from. We like communication services.

But I mean, who's-- why do you have to pick one or two sectors, right? We're saying, like, do a barbell approach. Stick with some of those leaders-- your communication or technology. And then over here, you've got those cyclicals that you said.

We like industrials. We like materials. We don't like banks as much. I know if the yield curve goes up, that's supposed to help bank's financials. But still we're a little lukewarm on that group. So those are kind of two-barbelled approach where if the economy is slowed and move a lot, we know the playbook. That's going to help technology and big caps over here.

But if things keep opening it, and we get a vaccine, and then the economy keeps surprising to the upside, which honestly-- I know the employment date has been weak-- most the other economic data, though, has surprised to the upside. It makes sense, kind of in our view, to kind of a barbell approach and, you know, benefit both ways, potentially.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Good commentary there. While you were talking, I was flipping through some charts. And I just want to kind of explain how these fit into the macro picture here. We're looking at the 10-year treasury yield.

I think what's most obvious here is we've just been in this incredible consolidation. And I'm going to try and draw a straight line here, but you can just see it's been in a box. Yes, we went above and a few places and probably below as well, but it didn't last long. And that means we've had this-- we've had this run up in treasury yields over the last three, four sessions, and it could very well we reverse at these levels. And we've seen them reverse before right around here.

So the rotation that we've seen in the last few weeks in fits and starts around these cyclicals, that could continue. But if yields are dropped back down, and that's going to be-- that's going to favor those big growth names, some mega caps like Apple, Amazon, Tesla. You throw that in as a FANG stock note too, those stocks did very well and were the go-to choice when interest rates were dropping. And that's because in a growth-- you want growth stocks when you have a low-interest environment.

It gets into there is no alternative and a bunch of other things. But in general, when you have dropping interest rates and a contracting yield curve, you're going to see defensive names like utilities outperform because they're interest rate proxies and then those big cap growth names. And on the way up, that's when you see the rotation into industrials. And I think that's-- and some other, maybe some value plays.

You know, pick and choose here, but I think that's what we're seeing is the anticipation that we could have an expanding yield curve. And we're preparing for that now, but it's not going to be a straight line. Even if the index tends to go up from the lower-- from the lower left to the upper right in the individual sectors, it's going to be rotation. It's not going to be easy.

All right, let's do this. Let's read the results of the last poll. So 35% of you have one year or less experience trading. 30% of one to three years. And three-- excuse me-- 22% have three to 10 years. And 13% have 10 years or more. So the most popular answer-- one to three years, all right?

And we do have another poll. And I think we might have given away the answer, but that's fine. This is poll number three. The historically best quarter for stocks in any given year is, is it the first quarter? Second quarter? Third quarter? Or fourth quarter? And we're going to be taking that poll down in a couple of minutes here.

Ryan, I want to bring you back in and just talk about-- and talk about the current bull market because you have an-- guys, can you pull up big third quarter? We have a slide that shows when we have big gains in the third quarter, they oftentimes translate to the fourth quarter. How does this fit in with the discussion we were having previously with the seasonality?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. Well, first off, on the recent poll, I did give it away. So sorry about that. But this is-- I guess we'll know how closely everyone's paying attention because I did give away the answer on what quarter's the best one. So we'll see.

But yeah, I mean, you know, historically, the third quarter is not that great, OK? That is usually what we see is usually a weak third quarter that we had anything but that this year in 2020 where stocks gained up over 8%. The S&P gained up over 8% in the normally weakish third quarter.

We'd have to think-- I'm like, you know, what does that mean? Is that given any clue, any sign what might happen the fourth quarter, which again is normally pretty good? Sure enough, as you see on the screen, every single time we've had stocks in the third quarter up 7 and 1/2%, the fourth quarter has been higher, and actually by pretty wide margin a lot of times.

So I think it's just the market's way of saying, something's going on. And we don't necessarily know what, but something's going on under the surface as this normally weak time does well. You mentioned your yields. I want to go on that for a second because you had a good discussion on yields.

Remember back on-- I guess it was what? The last new high, was it May 2-- or I'm sorry, January 21. I think-- oh, so sorry-- February, February 21, S&P made a new all-time high, the last new all-time high until the 34% correction. The bond market was freaking out most of February, meaning freaking out as in yields were dropping significantly.

Everybody-- all the stock guys were looking around, like, what's the bond market worried about? Stocks are making new highs. Everything's great. Well, the bond market was worried.

But now what you see with the 10-year yield, it's not breaking down again. In fact, it's kind of starting to breakout. So the stock guys get a little worried here. Ah, too far, too fast, or sees concerns. Now, the bond guys aren't so worried.

And that's a really good sign. Some people say bond guys are the smartest guys in the room. I kind of believe that to a degree. And they're not as worried now, right? Credit spreads-- don't want to get too geeky, but credit spreads have really come down.

So the most hit industries have been devastated by this thing have been-- their credit spreads have come down. So there's some confidence coming into the fixed income world on the economy. And that's something I wouldn't necessarily want to bet against. Though the bond guys are right back when we had the big worry, now maybe if the economy's better, maybe the bond guys will be right once again here.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. That's a great explanation, Ryan. And it kind of fits in. I just want to take a couple more questions about bonds since we're on the topic. And one here is 10-year treasury yields. ""You mentioned that 10-year treasury yields are rising. What is your view for the next six months to a year?"" And one other, ""how can one justify investing in bonds when the interest rates are so low and can go and only go up?""

Well, I'm going to take that first. I'm going to say they can go down again. We could have some deflationary stock. Any number of things could happen in the coming quarters. Not expecting another full lockdown, but some of the ancillary knock-on effects of what happened before the economic shutdown, those might propagate through the system. Commercial real estate, the Fed has been looking at that.

You also take a look at some of the other economic indicators. Jobs-- we're just seeing huge layoffs, potentially in the airlines; Disney, 20,000, something like that. So my view over the next six months is interest-- I expect longer term rates to rise, but slowly. It's going to be fits and starts.

It's going to be a long time to break out of this pattern or this holding pattern we've seen since April. But when they do, probably going to be big. Your thoughts, Ryan?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, agree. We're looking for higher rates, too. Now, there's been a lot of people have been talking about higher rates for years. Anything but that has happened. But, you know, I mean, I like to talk about cooper. I don't know if you can pull up a chart of copper or not while I'm doing this. If not, it's OK.

But copper has been really strong, OK, so far the last, several months. In copper, they call it like a Dr. Copper. So goes copper, goes the economy. He's got a PhD in the economy. I get it. China buys like half of the world's coppers, and China is coming back online.

But it's very hard for us at LPL Research to be bearish, the economy or bearish to global economy when copper is doing well. And when you think about it also, copper historically is kind of correlated with the 10-year yield, which is kind of where I'm going with this conversation now. If copper's been strong, we think the yields will eventually follow copper's lead here. And that'll push yields higher.

So from that fixed income point of view, there's always a place for bonds in a portfolio, especially an uncertain world like we're living in now. But if you're going to have higher yields, the way we're looking at it here at LPL Research with the money that we run for our advisors, we're shortening up duration. Things won't be as impacted by a higher surge in yield prices; also buying a little bit higher quality here.

We do like mortgage-backed securities as a potential play on officially higher yields going forward. And I do think copper is giving us that signal potentially on yields will probably a good deal higher 6 to 12 months from now.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Good stuff. Well, I want to turn to the VIX. And if, guys, you could scroll up the VIX curve, it slide six here. Everybody's been talking about volatility. We've known for some time because we have VIX futures contracts that settle in every month-- January through December.

Those prices for October, November, December have been elevated for some time. And what this is showing is the VIX curve. And that's all these monthly four dates that we're talking about. So basically the beginning of September versus October.

So the cyan line that's higher in the beginning, that was September. And we could see there was priced in more volatility then we are currently pricing in right now. And this is versus what happened a month ago.

But you can still see here that the VIX expectations going out are now more. So there's greater volatility than a month ago expected for the future. Ryan, how are you viewing volatility right now? And your expectations for the next couple of quarters.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. Well, it makes sense, I think. I mean, there's just so much uncertainty out there. You're willing to pay up a little bit of a premium. Remember the VIX is a function of option prices. And I traded options for about 11 years before it came in the world of money management working with advisors like I do now.

So starting to kind of makes sense is a way to put it. And you know, I hear the VIX, and it's like, you know, known as the fear gauge. And I'm not crazy about that name on the VIX. But there's other ways to look at market sentiment. I mean, various sentiment polls, they're still showing investors are kind of skeptical, right?

I mean, look at fund flows. I mean, there's still not a lot of people jumping hands over-- hand over foot, hand over fist, or whatever the the saying is-- to kind of get into equities here. And you know, that's from that contrarian point of view, maybe a bigger term picture positive. But at the same time, it just-- you know, with-- let's be honest, are we really going to have a president on November 4?

You know, we probably will. But the chances of some type of an argument back and forth is very high. And what do we see in 2000 when we had to wait til, I think it was December 12th, until we got the official winner of the election. Well, we saw about a 10% correction in the S&P 500.

So now that was also late 2000. That was a recession. There were different things happening. But it was the uncertainty that is just swirling and kind of continues to swirl again. Just last 24 hours, fiscal plan is off. Forget about it, we're just going to put this on the Supreme Court now.

Oh, no, never mind, here's $1,200 checks for people. That's not official, but that's-- it's just amazing at how quickly things change in this wharf we're in right now. And it's not really a laughing matter because it's unbelievable when you're talking real people's money. But at the same time, I think the market is willing to pay a little bit of a premium for any type of craziness that we're going to see either next month or so before the election or even a couple months after the election when anything is going to be very clear, I think, unfortunately.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I'd have to agree with you there. I'm sure Mark Twain has a quote about that too somewhere.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah, he said--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

RYAN DETRICK: --Mark Twain, he said, October is the most dangerous month for equities. The others are February, January, December, August, November. It's something along those lines. Mark's got them all. He's a-- he's a good guy.

JARED BLIKRE: [LAUGHS] You can always safely attribute anything to him.

RYAN DETRICK: Yes.

JARED BLIKRE: All right. We got-- I want to play-- since we're talking about potential surprises about volatility, I want to play a clip from Ian Bremmer who was on one of our shows. This was a couple weeks ago, but he's highlighting some surprises, potential surprises that haven't happened. Let's take a listen.

IAN BREMMER: What happens if there is a financial crisis involving emerging markets that are having a really hard time at a time when the president and the administration would need to agree on a major external bailout? That's a lot harder to do when we don't-- when we're fighting immensely over what just happened with the election. What happens if the Chinese government decides to change facts on the ground in Taiwan, or the Russians do in Belarus, or the Iranians do with the Straits of Hormuz, or the Turks do in the Eastern Med?

In other words, I think that there is an exceptional period of risk, both domestically and globally, in those weeks to months when we don't actually know what the outcome of the election is going to be. And I think that there's real market volatility that can come around that. I mean, the story of the pandemic has been just how strong the American market's have been. Not clearly we're going to feel that level of confidence when we're fighting over this election outcome. And we need clarity on what direction our government is actually headed.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. So I'm going to put up a chart of the EER emerging markets ETF by iShares. And we can see that we've been consolidating sideways since July. So this is basically at least three months. And maybe we're breaking out right now. It looks like the RSI's only 60, but might have the momentum to do it. What are your thoughts, Ryan, on what Ian Bremmer just said and emerging markets here and potential risks?

RYAN DETRICK: Well, I'll just say this-- that share behind Ian looked really comfortable. I was like, why's he not sitting in that chair? [LAUGHS] But no, you know-- sorry. You know, at LPL Research, we like emerging markets. I mean, we're bullish. I can't disagree with anything he said.

I mean, those worries and those concerns are absolutely there. Yet when you talk about emerging markets, you know, a lot of it comes down to the US dollar, in our view, the US dollar is in a major structural shift where it's going to go lower. You look at the dollar, for 16-year cycles, the dollar kind of makes major peaks, OK?

In '85, the dollar made a major peak. In 2001, the dollar made a major peak. 16 years later is 2017. The dollar made a major peak, and I know we had that big spike in March we were the dash for trash, never went to the dollar. But since then, it's obviously weakened.

So if the dollar goes lower for the next three or four years, which is kind of our base case at LPL Research with lower rates, and, you know, it's got some of the bigger structural concerns all the deficits that we have, the dollar going down benefits global stock markets, specifically emerging markets. And again, I guess you still call China an emerging market, although I'm not so crazy about that, but you do. They're still a big part of it.

China's growth is really coming back. I know nobody really trust Chinese data. I get it, but I trust what Hyatt said. Hyatt said more people are staying in hotels now than they were back in September before everything really got bad, in China, at least. So they're coming back online. And that is a big part of kind of why we like emerging markets.

You talk about-- we like the US, too. But where would a global investor go? We say emerging markets overdeveloped international, specifically Europe there. We still like emerging markets. That's where the growth is coming from.

There's good valuation. There's risk. There's always risk in emerging markets, no doubt about it. But with China really coming back, that's a risk we were willing to take in the portfolios that we run for our advisors.

JARED BLIKRE: And a weaker dollar generally good for risk markets in general.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah.

JARED BLIKRE: We were just showing that-- we were just showing that slide that you put together that shows how US dollar can predict the presidential outcome. And I think it's very much inversely what we're seeing with-- there we go-- inversely what we're seeing with stocks. So we don't have to go over the details, though. But a weaker dollar, risk on, tends to predict the election in some way. Fair to say? All right--

RYAN DETRICK: No, exactly--

JARED BLIKRE: Go ahead.

RYAN DETRICK: Go ahead, sorry. Probably just say that if the dollar goes up a lot between now and the election, that doesn't bode well for President Trump. If the dollar weakens, that bodes well for President Trump. That's what history has told us when you follow the US dollar in the currency markets. And that's kind of what it is. So pay attention to the currency market.

One thing along 2016-- I was going to say this earlier-- the Dow was down nine days in a row directly ahead of the 2016 election. Copper, the industrial metal of copper, was up a record 14 straight days before that election in 2016. Everyone, including LPL Research, thought Hillary Clinton is going to win.

Not the stock market. If the stock market's weak ahead of the election, that tends to bode well for a new party or new power in the White House. And copper was an industrial play based for President Trump, right, some type of infrastructure plan. It didn't really happened, but that was the place. So the markets were telling us a wildly different scenario than what every expert was telling us.

And I'd rather pay attention to the markets. And that's why paying attention the dollar and stocks and yields, all these different things might give a clue who's in the White House or who wins the election in November, but officially in the White House next January.

JARED BLIKRE: That's some great insight there. I want to go over the results from one of our previous polls. And this was the historically best quarter for stocks in any given year is, was it the first quarter? 14% said, yes. Then that, second quarter? 17%; third? 7%; fourth quarter? 62%. That is the right answer. Good job, guys.

All right, so now our next poll here. Let's see-- pull forward, the top source for my trading decisions is-- free advisory service, paid advisory or a subscription service, Twitter or message boards, financial media, my own research. We're going to go over that-- the results for that in a second.

Well, now, I want to take a few minutes to go over Yahoo Finance Premium. And I just wanted to kind of overview what's available. We're going to take a look at the value of diversification, risk level, analysis that it provides, and then get into some concrete examples of how it selects trades or potential trades in various tickers here.

All right, I'm just going to share my screen, and we'll be up and running. All right, so this is what you'll see when you log in. This is the desktop. And I have a portfolio here. I created it arbitrarily just over a year ago. We can see it's outperforming the S&P 500.

[INAUDIBLE] is being heavily loaded with FANG stocks, so actually outperforming by quite a nice margin. And it will give you fair value readings for your various constituents in there. It will also give you, what we have here on the left, research reports. These are fundamental reports by Argus Research. They will make buying/selling decisions.

And the company outlook-- we have various fields here. Pretty-- this is unique. I will say I haven't seen this before. You can examine a company, for instance, like Netflix on several different scenarios just looking at this simple graph on dividends, innovation, hiring, sustainability, earnings.

And then we have technical events for the short, medium, and long term. And we're going to take a look at a few stocks in the second here. But in general, we also have the insights. I find this particularly interesting and useful because if you click into, for instance, risk level, we're going to see this down here. You can get a measure of your entire portfolio.

Is it over-- is it overallocated to one area? And maybe that's what you want. But maybe you don't know, and maybe you should know. That we have portfolio risk measures that go historically either monthly or more often. And also, measures of volatility and beta of the portfolio to the market. That's how far it moves relative to a given move in a benchmark.

So let's now take out a couple stocks. And what I want to do is go to our investment ideas. If you watch programs, and see me on a day-to-day basis, I do one of these usually every day. And we'll see if I can get this going here. It's like my browser's a little slow.

OK. Investment ideas. And so let's take a look at some of these ideas here. We have-- we can filter them by idea. Type fundamental or technical. Take a look at one of each of them, how long term, short, medium, and long term. What sector?

You can have multiple portfolios here where you import your entire portfolio from your broker's account. It's actually very, very simple. You can also do it by date range. So we'll just pull up Wayfair. This is an idea that was generated today, October 7.

They're boosting the target price to $360. They have a bunch of reasons here. If you want to look at a chart, easy enough to do. You can 22% potential if they do make that target. And here's what you would see in Wayfair. These are one-month candles, but you can just see how they've been on incredible tear since those March lows for the most part.

Let's take a look at a technical position here or recommendation. I think I was looking at one here. Oh, Vidu's always interesting. Take a look at Vidu. So we have a description of what it's doing.

It has a bottoming triangle, bottoming wedge. Then they have a price target for it. So we view it in a chart. What I really like here is it shows you the pattern. So you can see here where the triangle exactly is.

And you can see it's just barely budging to the upside here, but hasn't got off the ground just yet. It means there is still opportunity in the pattern. And if you wanted to set, for instance, some risk measurement price levels here, I would probably look under one of these moving averages. If you want to be ultra conservative, view below 118. That's a 200 day. But you can put it higher there theoretically too maybe underneath this to around maybe 123, 122, something in there.

Also, on the right side of the screen, it will tell you exactly what's going on; what the pattern means, event descriptions. So it kind of hold your hands there, too. Pretty interesting.

All right. So we're going to move on. And we're going to resu-- here's the results of our last poll-- top funding-- top source for my trading decisions is pre-advisory service, 5%; paid advisory, 9%; Twitter message board, 0%-- nobody falling into that trap. That's good. I like to hear that-- financial media, 18%. My own research is the top vote-getter.

So that's impressive. It's always important to do your own research. I think you'd agree with that, Ryan, although you can rely on other people. But I just want to bring you back into this discussion and talk about sector performance, again. I think we have some questions relating to that.

So we talked about these rotation into value cyclicals. There's a lot of talk about that, but what about hedging? Is there-- are things people can do in maybe derivatives like stock options? Some people want to know if they should simply buy bonds.

How do you-- how do you hedge risk in this time? And we're only talking about the next few months until the election is sorted out, Ryan.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, you know, we'd probably say, stay away from doing options unless you have, you know, a professional potential to help you. But the easiest way is maybe add a little more bonds. There's nothing wrong with losing a little bit of cash also. And gold, we talk about the dollar going lower. Structurally, that should be a potential positive for gold.

So you know, everybody-- in March, when gold was getting killed; bonds were getting killed; stocks were getting killed; everything was getting killed, everybody was wondering what to do. And a lot of people sold near the lows. And then you look back, it's like, man, if I just wouldn't use that as an opportunity to kind of rebalance my portfolio and not panic, I might have had a really wonderful buying opportunity, looking back.

So it's so important to kind of have that, you know, longer term-- I mean, everybody becomes a trader on a pullback. Long-term investors become traders on pullbacks. And I believe me, I know there's a lot of traders listen to this right now. But for those longer term investors, it's just unique the way you need to use it.

And you know, this-- but to that poll just for a second If I could, you know, with our advisors, what we've seen in 2020, right, everything's been hyper drive. The way technology, the way we communicate, everything's been hyper drive.

And what we found with our advisors, some of the most successful-- and this is not just the world of financial advisors; it's the world in general-- are the most nimble-- the ones that are built-- have the ability to adapt to the surroundings around them. You know, just the fact that we're doing this, you know, virtually now, we didn't necessarily do as many these things.

And we're doing webinars all the time, Webex in blue jeans, and all these different ways to communicate. There's parts of the economy that are struggling. There's no doubt. 28,000 people at Disney just lost their jobs last couple of weeks. That is devastating.

But at the same time, there are other parts of the economy that are really picking up. And whether it be financial services or any other area, it's the ones that are nimble and able to adapt it have really, really succeeded. And we've seen with it our advisors. We've seen it around the world.

And that's going-- there's going to be another recession. There's going to be more problems. All right, can you adapt, and are you nimble are the two most-- two of the most popular-- not popular-- two of the most important things you need to do to continue to be successful, in our view.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. That's an excellent point because nobody expected that we were going to descend into the fastest bear market in history. And almost nobody at the bottom thought we'd be reaching record highs within a few months. So being nimble, important, keep your mind open, and also recognizing that these market cycles last many years, on a secular time frame, maybe 10 years, but they change.

You know, we have brand new leadership this year. This reminds me, even in March and April when the Fed first came out with the bazooka, you know, 10 emergency programs, that it reminded of 2009 because we took off, thanks to QE1 that year, which was really implemented in March. And the analog, it just in terms of the S&P 500 price right there.

And I remember being in that environment in 2009 when names I'd never heard of like Lululemon. But I thought it was pronounced Lululemon 'cause they didn't have any locations near me. But all these early leaders that ended up being later leaders, they were kind of born in that market cycle. And that's what we're seeing now. We're just seeing a repricing of a lot of that, the expectations for the new economy. And like it or not, we are in a new economy.

You mentioned jobs, Ryan. I want to get to a clip we have Eric Rosengren. He's a New York Fed Governor. And he's talking about the jobless situation. Let's take a listen.

ERIC ROSENGREN: I am very worried that we're pretty far away from what we think is maximum employment. And I think there are going to be significant headwinds to getting there quickly. So I have a somewhat more pessimistic forecast than my colleagues that you could have seen from this summary of economic projections that the FOMC recently put out. They're expecting that the unemployment rate will get below 6% by the end of next year. I'm not expecting that.

And some of the headwinds include the problems with re-employing people. So I am worried that many of temporary layoffs are starting to turn to permanent, as the pandemic drags on much longer than people expected earlier this year. So I think that's going to be a challenge in particularly the segments of the labor market that are being impacted.

So if you think about travel, if you think about tourism, if you think about restaurants, if you think about retail, those are areas where a lot of payroll employment increased over the course of the summer. But continued progress is really going to require that the pandemic be tamed to the degree that people can be fully employed; people feel comfortable once again going to restaurants and hotels.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I think the bottom line for me is we have no idea what to expect. Things can change on a dime. And people are going to get maybe more unemployment checks. But I think the big picture overall is there's going to be restructuring, and we're going to be retraining.

All right, before we go, I want to get to our next subject, which has to do with presidential health scares. That's something that happened recently. Probably not going to be a long-term impact here. It looks like President Trump is recovering out of Walter Reed, Monday. But I do want to cover this.

So our sixth poll-- and we're going to get to this answer right here in the segment-- is the most severe stock market reaction to a US presidential health scare over the last century is-- is it Warren G. Harding when he died? FDR when he died? Dwight D. Eisenhower, heart attack? JFK, assassinated? Ronald Reagan, shot? Donald Trump, COVID?

And I went through the numbers here, Ryan. I went back through history. And it doesn't really look like much ever happens off of presidential health care. And that was kind of in line with what I thought because these aren't structural risks to the economy.

It's-- you know, unless somebody is a cult of personality here, like the leader of an authoritarian dictatorship, I wouldn't expect it to have much. But if we can put that slide up-- yeah, we have it right here-- you can just see the number of days to the bottom, usually one or two. We do have that exception with Dwight D. Eisenhower's heart attack.

But aside from that, these tend to be one-off events. And I would say-- I do want to cover this, too. The potential-- if something happens to President Trump between now and Inauguration Day, what happens, especially election day? Because millions of people who've already voted-- it's hard to handicap this scenario.

I think you'd have a lot of legal risk, probably a lot of wrangling the courts. But I think we'd figure it out. And Ryan, I do want to get your thoughts on know what kind of surprises here we might see.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. Well, sounds like the Heisman, right? People will vote for the Heisman before the season is over. Then some guy's like, great game at the end. You're like, man, I should have voted for him.

But you know, if you think about it, when JFK was tragically shot and killed, you know what the S&P 500 did? It went up the next eight straight months, one of the longest monthly win streaks that we've ever seen. I mean, so it is terrible, terrible what happened. But again, whoever wins this election is going to get the keys to a really solid economy, in our view, an improving economy. Is not a rip roaring. I mean, the segment just played from the Fed chair-- from the Fed chairperson there-- or Fed-- who was it? Rosengren--

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah.

RYAN DETRICK: --from him talking about the jobs, I mean, I agree. Like, believe me, jobs are the big issue. I mean, they're not coming back as much as we would have thought. Yet, go look at consumer confidence, which has had one of its largest jumps ever, which, historically speaking, end recessions.

You've got housing. Existing home sales, new home sales, 14-year highs. I mean, there are-- you can pick parts of the economy that aren't doing great, but there are some other parts that really are. I want to summarize with one more big picture thing. It's called the seven-year itch.

If you look back historically, there's a bull market, in my opinion, that started in 1950. Seven years in, in 1957, 20% correction and a recession. You know what happened after that? Kept going up to 1966-- seven years in and had that bear market.

In my opinion, the bull market didn't start in '82. It started in 1980. That's when the S&P broke out to new highs for the first time in 1980. Do the math. Seven years later, that's 1987-- big time correction. And then what happened? Another 13 years of gains.

Right now, this bull market, in my opinion-- or the previous bull market, in my opinion-- did not start in 2009. It started in 2013 when we broke out to new highs after a range of over a decade. You add seven years to 2013, what do you get? 2020.

Just had a bear market. Just had a recession. History would tell us, potentially, if we follow those two other scenarios, there could still be years left of this major secular bull market with higher prices. And in my opinion, that's what I think is the case. People keep doubting this bull market. There are concerns, but this recession isn't like the other ones.

This one stopped because we had to, 'cause there's a devastating, devastating, you know, virus that is impacting us. At the same time, the economy was in pretty good shape heading in. What's credit card debt done during this recession? It's gone down.

We gave people money. They didn't go out and spend and waste it-- maybe some people did. But credit card debts' come down. There are some-- there are some positives that have taken place. There aren't many. I mean, I know there's a lot of negatives.

But bigger picture, the seven-year itch-- whether it be relationships, your job, or the stock market, you get these corrections in seven years. And then you can have years to go. And I just think that's something really important that a lot of people don't understand. And it made sense that 2020 had this correction.

34% in six weeks? I didn't think I'd be that fast. But some type of correction in 2020 made sense. And that's where we are so far at least.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. All very good observations. And I would add one thing you brought up was definition of bull market. There are several different ones. The financial media tends to use just one, which is the S&P 500, 20% correct or 20% downdraft on a close-to-close basis.

We missed that by a fraction in 2011; I think in 2018, too. So a lot of it's arbitrary. But I like the way you look at the market. And I want to get to at least one more question before we have to end this here. How do you spot money flowing into a stock before it takes off?

And I just want to pull up some charts here. And there are a couple of different ways-- not couple, there's dozens. Maybe there is an infinite number of ways. We're looking at DraftKings right here. And it was towards the beginning of the year-- I think it was in January.

This was a SPAC deal. So you actually had the opportunity to buy this back before we got-- before the deal was actually done. But just relationships with moving averages, I think that's one way of looking at it. When you have the price extended beyond it, you have a lot of money coming into it, and you have chart formations. That's another way of looking at it.

Though, if you get to another high with-- either different ways of looking at this. But let's say you're retesting a high, there are certain technical indications where that may say, we can break out of this. I'd like to look at RSI as kind of a momentum indicator. You can use MACD. You can use CCI, lots of ways to look at this.

Palantir, this is a really interesting stock. This just went live through a direct listing a few days ago. But for here, I'm using Anchored VWAP. And that's basically the Volume-Weighted Average Price. And you can do it through an indicator. And this is free on our site, not even premium, under all indicators Anchored VWAP.

And I have two lines on here. So this is measuring the average supply and demand. Are people making money? Are the longs making money? Are the shorts making money? If It's below the shorts are making money, it's pretty interesting.

And you can start this from different locations. So we got two now from the very first bar to the 30-minute bars on Palantir. And then from the low, and you can see the prices started to use this lower Anchored VWAP from this date right here at 10/6, the open it's using as support.

And now it's breaking above. So it looks like Palantir is getting a little bullish to me, just based on this analysis. So there's lots to look at here. And I love trading, as I hope it's-- as I hope everybody can tell.

And I think, Ryan, you're in the same camp. How do you look-- how do you look at the markets? And pick any ticker you want, and we can just take a look at it here before we go.

RYAN DETRICK: Well, I mean, I used to trade, like I said more, short term, looking at options. I'm now more of a bigger picture macro thinker. And I agree with a lot of the things you just said. At the same time, I like to use relative strength.

I mentioned, you know, semiconductors earlier-- like SMH. If you look at the semiconductor SMH versus the S&P 500, it's breaking out, right? Relative strength, it's outperforming, more than it ever has, the S&P 500. To me, those are the signs and the clues that we see we're looking for big sectors or sector ETFs that potentially can start to do well.

I mean, price action hasn't made a new high quite yet, but you've already got the breakout. And then you look at things like Advance-Decline Line, you know how, many stocks going up versus down, just yesterday, or two days ago-- sorry-- just two days ago, the S&P 500's Advance-Decline Line made a new all-time high.

People tell us that just a few stocks are leading this thing higher. Yeah, they're pulling it higher to a degree. But there's a lot more small caps out there. They're starting to do better. There's a lot of beaten up things that are doing better. So that is participation.

You see Advance-Decline Lines peak anywhere between 10 to 14 months before the actual indices peak. We just made new highs on the S&P 500's Advance-Decline Line two days ago. That would suggest again, if we do this in six months or a year from now, we're probably would have higher prices because that's just kind of what history tells us.

There is participation there with the credit markets and credit spreads still being low there's. Two things I like to follow at the end of the day-- advance decline lines and what do the credit spreads tell me? Advance-Decline Lines are strong, and the credit markets are still quite calm. Those are two reasons I think the fundamentals are still there and the technicals are still there. So this upward trajectory is very, very much in play.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I love looking at those Advance-Decline Lines myself. And kind of a warning sign when we saw them getting into a short-term downtrend. Meanwhile, the market was still by its all-time highs.

So I'm going to review the results of our last poll before we go here. And this was the most severe stock market reaction to a US presidential health scare over the last century. And people guessed, in the highest numbers, 41% for JFK. But the right answer was Dwight D. Eisenhower. That was a heart attack. 18%, though, did guess correctly.

All right, I've been saying we're going to go pretty soon, and it's for real now. But I want to get to this one last viewer question. ""What is--"" and this is by Alusis-- ""what is one book you would recommend that is unrelated to trading, but help build the foundation to your trading?""

That's a good one. I'm going to answer first 'cause I saw that one coming-- ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" It's one of those staples of kind of business management and personal growth seminars, whatever. But I think that kind of got me in a decent mindset to appreciate the psychological effects of trading, which are different than just about everything else, but it's a different approach. How about you, Ryan?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, you know, I read just a lot of financial books. I'm trying to think-- anything Ben Carlson writes or Morgan Housel. I mean, those two are just some of the greatest financial minds. And they're not always writing about trading and what you should do with investments and things.

But anything those guys do, kind of a new way-- like, you know, where do you get your information? Well, I get it from Twitter or something like that. There is absolutely, though-- what those guys are doing, they've had some books come out recently. I would highly recommend anything those guys do, I think.

JARED BLIKRE: All right. Now, we're going to end on that note. I want to thank everybody for attending here. We do these once a month on the first Tuesday at 2:00 PM of every month. So we're going to be back here in November. And I'm sure we're going to be talking about the elections right around then.

We'll have to see if we have a president. Nobody knows. Again, thank you, everybody, for attending. Thank you, Ryan, for being here and offering your wisdom. Lots of great stuff to take away from this. Thanks for all our support staff for their help. And we're going to end it right there.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/premium-trading-election-odds-historically-182726093.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IWM.US', 'NKLA.US', 'PI7.F', 'PINS.US', 'PLTR.US', 'PRI.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US', 'SVXY.US', 'TAN.US', 'TSLA.US', 'UVXY.US']","['AMAZON', 'APPLE', 'JARED BLIKRE', 'LPL FINANCIAL', 'OPTIONS MARKET', 'RYAN DETRICK']","{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.126}"

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: A man of many hats, Kurt Andersen is a radio host, an entrepreneur, a television producer, and a novelist. But before becoming a wizard of all things, he started out as a journalist. After graduating from Harvard, Andersen co-founded ""Spy,"" a satirical magazine which mocked American celebrities and media icons in the late 1980s and 1990s, including now President Trump.

From there, Kurt worked as an editor in chief of ""New York Magazine,"" then moved to ""The New York Times,"" and later created his own radio show. These days, he describes himself as a book writer. But Andersen says he's always had more than one plate spinning at a time. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Kurt Andersen about his newest book, his infamous nickname for President Donald Trump, and how America's middle class is at war with the ultra rich.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest Kurt Andersen, who is a journalist, radio host, and author of a number of books, including the new ""Evil Geniuses, The Unmaking of America."" Kurt, great to see you.

KURT ANDERSEN: Good to see you, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So I want to ask you, first of all, about that introduction. And this is an unusual question. But is that how you would describe yourself? I mean, what do you do for a living, Kurt?

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, I do fewer things lately. I stopped doing the radio show a few months ago. I would say I write books. I mean, I'm also working on another podcast. I'm also working on a TV show. I tend to have more than one plate spinning at a time, but pretty much I'm a book writer.

ANDY SERWER: Right. So let's talk about ""Evil Geniuses"" a little bit. The book describes the rise of wealth inequality and political influence of wealthy interest in the United States since the '60s and '70s. Why did you decide to write about this?

Story continues

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, it sort of found me, as writers say, but it did. I wrote a-- I've been writing novels for 20 years, and then I wrote a nonfiction book that came out three years ago called ""Fantasyland."" There was another history of America and how in my view we screwed ourselves up. And that was about the what I call the sort of part of the American character that has always been there, which is the kind of weakness for believing the untrue if it's exciting enough to believe and that it finally got out of hand the last few decades and especially the last four years.

And so I realized after that after I finished that book that that was really only half the story. That was a purely cultural story, really, and that there was this other set of things that had happened in the last 50 years. So I realized there was a kind of sequel to write that was more yes. ""Evil Geniuses"" is also about cultural changes and how I tie that into the rest of what I talk about. But mostly, the book is about economics, as you say, and politics and technology.

And so, really, there was one-- there were several times when I was talking about ""Evil Geniuses"" or, rather, when I've talked about ""Fantasyland."" And people in audiences would say, well, yeah, OK, Americans don't believe in climate change. But isn't that just because the Koch brothers made them not believe in climate change by spending all this money on politics?

And I would say yes, sure, that's part of it. But there is this predisposition among Americans, unlike people in most developed countries, to believe things that aren't true. And but then I realized that it is the combination in that instance. It is the combination of credulity of Americans along with this very deliberate strategic work over decades to make them in the particular case of climate change, not believe that it's a real thing or a thing to worry about.

So then I realized I'd been around. I was a, you know, young adult in the 1980s as even the '70s, I was a young adult. And so I was there when-- what I what this book is about happened. But I realized I wasn't paying very close attention even though I was also a journalist.

I wasn't really paying attention partly because I was doing well as this cabal, if you will, of evil geniuses was twisting and changing and transforming our whole economic system through the '70s and '80s and '90s. I was doing fine. And, therefore, my-- my kind of I suppose my acuity had seen all that was happening was blunted by the fact that it was working out pretty well for me.

ANDY SERWER: Right, exactly. And-- and so when you talk about that, there is this role that is played by people in the left in the Democratic Party that it's not just the right. There's a-- I don't know if being complicit is too strong a word. But--

KURT ANDERSEN: I'll take it.

ANDY SERWER: Is it that? Then explain yourself. I mean, so the left is a part of it then.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, certainly, the liberal-- the-- yes, left of center people were definitely a part of it. I mean, the book is primarily about the economic right, the Milton Friedmanites, the Kochs, the other right wing billionaires, the whole right wing counter establishment, economic right wingers, and what they built in the '70s and '80s and '90s to really create a paradigm shift about how all of us and our system thought about fairness and equality and all those things economically.

But we knew Democrats, as they were called starting in the '70s, the Gary Hart's, the Bob Kerrey's, the Bill Bradley's, the Paul Tsongas's-- all these guys who were my heroes, frankly-- said, oh, we're all free marketers now. We're all-- the '60s are over. We're now committed to compromise and figuring out a, you know, a good system that's all about the free market. And let's meet halfway.

Well, and they did. And we-- again, I wasn't a policy maker. We did. And then I just kept moving to the right. And there really ceased to be in this country a politically influential economic left. I mean, really, the-- they were still back in that day. There were still liberal Republicans.

Then the sort of Democrats on economics took over that role of being the liberal Republicans. And there were no FDR's left. There was not that economic vision politically that had any kind of consequence or power or much influence in the United States.

ANDY SERWER: That reminds me of two things quickly. One, I remember a British person explaining to another British person, said, well, you've got the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, which is like the Tory Party here. And you got the Democratic Party. And that's like the Tory Party here. [LAUGHS]

And then another one, I remember just a couple of years ago, Kurt, I'm up in Maine. And someone said to me for the first time. And I was shocked when they said this to me. But it makes so much sense now that the Bush's and the Clinton's-- they're all the same.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, exactly. You know, and I used to-- I remember back in the '90s. I remember the 2000 election when people would say to me, oh, you know, the Democrats, the Republicans-- they're not a lick of difference between them. And, of course, I would say but look, the Supreme Court race, women's rights, reproductive rights, all and on. And those indeed are significant differences between Democrats and Republicans then and now.

But what they were seeing-- and I wasn't-- oh, I wasn't, because, again, the system was not screwing me over was that in economics that they had their heads ceased to be much of a difference. It was really-- it was really a-- you know, people talked in hyperbolic terms that I always looked at as too hyperbolic about, you know, there's a Capitalist Party. There's a leftish half called the Democrats and a rightish half called the Republicans.

Now, and so that's true, even though, of course, the left and certainly my position in this book is like Elizabeth Warren's. I'm all for the free market system, just one that works and is sustainable for the long term and is fair as it was when I was young.

ANDY SERWER: So what do you say, or what do you think about the young person who supported Elizabeth Warren or Bernie and then you have to tell them-- not you-- but the Democrats or Biden has to say vote for me. And they're like, no?

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, not many of them are saying no I think. I hope not. But certainly in the-- during the primary campaign, that was a legit thing to say. And Joe Biden was not my first, second, or maybe even third choice candidate. But what I say to them, I say partly as a result of running ""Evil Geniuses"" and doing this forensic history of how this change and the hijacking happened is it is a long game.

It's not just one candidate and your favorite candidate or I'm leaving. It isn't this election. It's a long, long game that these guys played so brilliantly. And so, yes, you know, yes, you want-- we want radical change. I'll stipulate that young person who votes who was a Bernie Bro. But it comes, I'm afraid, you know, one step at a time. And the first step is would be great wouldn't it, I think, if we had a big landslide electing this moderate Democrat president.

And by the way, a moderate Democrat, who because his party has moved significantly left just in the last decade on economics finally has become a kind of party of the left on economics that he will do what his party wants because he is a kind of generic Democrat. And, therefore, I would say to them-- and I have said to them, including my children-- you know, you get this guy. And you get this administration elected. You hope for the best. You put pressure on him to do what you want to do in terms of child care and health care and higher taxes on the rich and big business and all the rest.

And, you know, this is your shot. I mean, you know-- you know, you couldn't even get Bernie Sanders nominated. So give up that-- give up your sorrow and anger about that and face what's in front of you, which is, you know, creating-- getting a Democratic senate, a Democratic president, and that's your first step. But it's only a first step.

ANDY SERWER: You wrote in your book about the rise of inequality. We were hoodwinked. We hoodwinked ourselves. Are you referring to the media there?

KURT ANDERSEN: No, I'm sure. But I'm really referring to-- to all of us. And certainly the media and the professional class of-- of liberals and even professional Democrats who I think overinterpreted what the election and the huge-- the landslide election of Ronald Reagan meant, I think-- but also just regular Americans who were convinced that, you know, they were voting to make America this beautiful, idyllic small town Bedford Falls kind of place like it is in Maine, like it is here in Connecticut, again, and really didn't read the fine print or didn't imagine what was really going on, which is that they, the normal people, the 80, 75% of Americans who aren't anywhere near the top we're going to get screwed. And they did.

So that's the hoodwinking. The hoodwinking by this-- this-- this kind of turning the nostalgia that had become so rampant in the 1970s and then into the '80s into a political means of selling Reaganism and Americas. It's a beautiful place, and it's morning in America without really going into the details, the hundreds of details of what that meant about how unfair and insecure and unequal all of the important pieces of the American economic system were about to become.

ANDY SERWER: What about someone like Warren Buffett? Or and there are other wealthy people out there who've been saying for years that our taxes-- their taxes should be raised. Taxes being a hot button issue this week. We'll get back to that.

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah. Well, Warren Buffett, whom I've known for a long time because I grew up in Omaha where he still lives, has been amazing and extraordinary. And I don't share some of the loathing of every-- each and every billionaire that some of my political friends and allies share.

He has been extraordinary. And not only has he said that that, oh, I should pay as much taxes as a percentage as my secretary, as he has said many times. He also said, as I talk about in the book, in 2005 and 2006, he said a couple of times in big interviews that got some attention at the time that, yes, there has been a class war. You conservatives are talking about how the left such as it was is fighting a class war.

There's been a class war, and it's my side. It's the rich people, and we're winning. And we shouldn't be. And he said that again and again. And I remember at the time thinking, wow, good for Warren. Yeah, right. But that's just hyperbole, isn't it? And really at that moment is when I began thinking and reading and studying more. And it ended up in this book, you know, ""Geniuses"" but realizing that it wasn't just a poetic notion.

There really was, had been since the 1970s, a kind of class war on the part of the rich to transform the economy. And in every, you know, graph you look at or of the history of how economic growth continue going, productivity kept rising. And, yet, all boats stopped rising together all at once around 1980. And it wasn't by accident.

ANDY SERWER: So I'm glad you mentioned the Omaha connection to Warren Buffett because I was going to ask you about that. So tell us about when you met him or first met him. Are you still in touch with him? I mean, everyone in Omaha almost know each other or something.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, yeah, because it's only a half a million people live in a city. And but my parents were friendly with him and unfortunately not friendly enough to invest money with him. But they were friendly. And I really didn't-- I got to know him a little bit when I was older.

For instance, I wrote him a letter when I and my friend Graydon Carter were starting ""Spy"" magazine in 1986, asking if he wanted to invest in ""Spy"" magazine. And he wrote me back and very nicely declined and saying, no, I don't invest in startups, well, that kind and so forth.

Anyways, then we run into each other over the years. And he's always really nice to me and always says nice things about my mom, my late mother and stuff. And so he's-- you know, he's great. And, again, in terms of a decent rich guy who eh, as you say, he's been-- he's been terrific.

But he also, he in his old school investment strategy of investing in companies for the long haul and letting them run themselves and all that stuff, really, this pre-1980 way of investing in regarding the system, again, that to me is much closer to optimal than the cut and run private equity-driven system and day trading investors without any commitment to anything that we-- that we've developed since.

ANDY SERWER: I had no idea that Warren Buffett might have been an investor in ""Spy"" magazine. I'm still processing that, Kurt. So ""Spy"" magazine, you know, for those people who don't know it, it was this amazing publication that spawned all kinds of careers and started all kinds of trends in journalism. And I was a huge fan.

One maybe the most enduring element was your nickname of the current president of the United States. And so you've been-- and we'll get to it. And you've been covering Donald Trump for decades now because of that. And so talk to us about the nickname that you came up for the president-- how you got it and all that.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, Donald Trump-- so ""Spy"" magazine was this satirical monthly magazine, started this small New York focused thing in 1986 and very quickly was in its way, very successful very quickly and became a national magazine. We had hundreds of thousands of readers and subscribers.

So as I say, it was a satirical magazine. So we had our targets and our recurring subjects. Donald Trump was in our first issue. The first issue, the cover story, the first issue was ""Jerks: The 10 Most Annoying New Yorkers."" Donald Trump being one of those 10. And, by the way, in the little write up on him in that first issue, he was talking about how he could be president. He could solve the Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union in an hour.

He would-- he didn't need to know anything more than he knows now. So, you know, on past is preface. So we call-- we in [INAUDIBLE] we for our recurrent subjects, whether it was Donald Trump or Henry Kissinger or whomever-- people we talked about regularly-- we created sort of epithets that we repeatedly attached to them once we settle on one only and called them that again and again and again.

Graydon and I had both worked at ""Time Magazine."" We're both working at ""Time Magazine"" at the time. And back in the day before our day. ""Time"" had had such epithets that they always back in the '40s and '50s that they referred to people as. So we thought, oh, that's funny. We'll do this kind of corny old fashioned things.

For instance, Henry Kissinger, we called socialite war criminal Henry Kissinger every time I referred to him. And Donald Trump, we tried various nicknames. And none of them stuck. And, you know, Queens born casino operator Donald Trump-- various kinds. Then we in 1988, we came up with short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump. And we knew we had a winner and kept at it and kept calling him that.

And that was based simply on the fact that Graydon as right before we were starting ""Spy"" had gone to interview Trump for a profile he was writing and came back to our little not even an office at the time, barely an office, and said, you know what. This guy, yeah, he's a big guy. He is 6 feet, almost as tall as I am, he said. But he's got the tiniest little fingers I've ever seen.

So ah, then when-- and, of course, he's a vulgarian. So when the time came to dream up a nickname, short-fingered vulgarian worked, and it stuck. And you say I studied Trump or covered him for years. I did-- certainly it's ""Spy."" But then from 1993 to 2015, not so much.

But then he came back. And then suddenly in a debate in 2015 with Marco Rubio, there they were, two candidates for president, arguing about whether his fingers were long or short and what it meant about his manhood and the rest. And I just felt like I was having an acid flashback at the time.

ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised that he's president?

KURT ANDERSEN: Ah, ha, that's so hard to say, Andy, at this point 4, 3, almost four years into it. Yes, it is. It remains to me a kind of amazing like, stuck in a nightmare, stuck in an acid trip surprise. I'm-- I can't say I wake up every day surprised. But something like some cousin of surprise, yes.

And even though this last book of mine that I mentioned, ""Fantasyland"" of which he became a kind of poster boy, I wrote and finished before he was even nominated. If he hadn't been nominated, if he hadn't run for president, let alone be elected. I probably wouldn't have mentioned him in the book. Maybe I would have. Maybe, but probably not. So I-- so I saw what was happening to the country that made it so right to elect such a preposterous monstrous person.

But that doesn't mean I wasn't still surprised when he was elected, given that, you know, back in 1988 when we thought he was a joke and-- and took national polls asking people if they wanted Donald Trump to run for president, because even back then, he was flirting with that notion. We thought it was just-- it was funny. It was a joke. It was he was a cartoon character, and he was fun to make fun of.

ANDY SERWER: Do you understand, Kurt, that some people watching this might be deeply offended by what you're saying, maybe call you a long-fingered liberal or I don't know what--

KURT ANDERSEN: Yes, they might. And both, all those-- both-- all of those adjectives are correct.

ANDY SERWER: OK, leave that alone. But what is it? I mean, 30%, 40% of America loves this man.

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah, yeah. Well, and 30% or 40%-- I would say 30% love him, and another 10% or 15% will vote for him would be my estimate. Then there are my evil geniuses who don't love him, by and large, who-- who understand that this is the guy they got who there-- who the hoi polloi in their right wing coalition love. And, therefore, they're stuck with him.

And as long as he gives them a $2 trillion tax cut, as he did in his one legislative accomplishment in 2017, and as long as he is a ferocious anti-regulation guy and really serves them in every way, except they don't like tariffs so much but will live with that, they're good by him.

So but what does it mean, the, you know, 30% really do love him? It's, you know, 30% of America believes all kinds of things, are strange and kooky and misguided in all kinds of ways. So, yeah, they managed to elect a president. And that's strange and phenomenal and a milestone. But what are you going to do?

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I mean, that's how it sort of ties into the book, right? I mean, that it speaks to people believing things. I mean, and maybe people believe Donald Trump, literally every single thing he says, I think that the president himself has said, hey, some of this is hyperbole, right?

KURT ANDERSEN: I don't know that he says that anymore. He said it-- well, rather, Tony Schwartz, his first ghostwriter, said it when he wrote Donald Trump's first memoir back in 1987. I don't-- he says, oh, I was joking. Or he doesn't say, as some people have said about him when he was running, oh, don't take me literally, but just take me seriously. He doesn't quite know the difference or care about the difference. And if he-- you know, he always gives himself the option of saying, oh, no, no, no, I was just joking, if he sometimes goes too far.

But he-- it's-- it is a-- it's just a show, sure, but he's also president of the United States, hurting and ruining many human beings' lives in various ways. So you know, you have to take him literally-- potentially literally-- always and for sure seriously always.

ANDY SERWER: So this notion that Americans historically have believed in things you don't understand, to quote a Stevie Wonder song I guess, right? But it's-- there's-- it's a more dangerous world now, Kurt, because of social media, arguably. And if you look at elements like QAnon, I mean, that's different from 30 years ago, right?

KURT ANDERSEN: It is. I mean, again, in fact, I talk about the kind of-- America's devolution into believing too many conspiracy theories to explain any bad thing that people think is bad started around-- you know, in the late '60s and slowly but surely got worse and worse, especially in the '90s and especially in the '90s and after because, as you say, of not just social media back then but the internet. Once we had an internet and all kinds of preposterous conspiracy theories and preposterous ideas and, quote unquote, ""facts"" of all kinds looked legit. Look, I saw it on the internet. It looks just like ""The New York Times."" It looks real. It must be real. We were in trouble because that was a new condition.

You know, there have always been crackpots. There's always been conspiracy theories. And by the way, as I always stipulate when I talk about conspiracy theories, I understand some conspiracies really exist. However, most conspiracies-- conspiracy theories-- are not true, and many of them are insane, like QAnon.

But once we had the internet, this-- what had become this default fantasy instinct to explain everything in terms of conspiracies-- really got out of control and was-- took over more and more of the brain space, especially on the right-- not just the right because, you know, for things like-- the anti-vaccine movement at the beginning was more left than right. The 9/11 truthers at the beginning were more left than right. But it became more of a thing of the right.

And once you had this ability to conscript believers and then suddenly believers felt like, look, I'm not the only person who believes this, there are thousands tens of thousands, millions of us, it was a cascade out of control. And yeah, eventually, you're going to get to QAnon, where there are god knows how many believers and now Republican candidates for the House of Representatives who are QAnon believers, this utterly preposterous, constantly evolving, kind of collectively authored theory of everything.

That-- again, in many ways, it's not so different than the thing that existed when you and I were children, which is the John Birch Society, but they at least had a focus. It was Soviet Union, China, communism, anticommunism, you know, Dwight Eisenhower was a stooge of the communists and so forth. Now, that was ridiculous, and they were extreme. But not even-- but the conservatives at the time, like William F. Buckley and Barry Goldwater, stigmatized them, kept them over-- away from the party. These were-- we couldn't have these people. That's no longer the case.

And thanks to the internet, you know, you don't have to go to some little storefront in Bogalusa to be a member of the conspiracy believers, as the John Birchers did. You-- they're everywhere, and it's as accessible as your telephone.

ANDY SERWER: You know, you're on Twitter a lot, Kurt.

KURT ANDERSEN: I am. I am, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So-- right, and so-- I am too much. I really look forward to the day that I'm done with it. And I don't know I can't say that-- like, that the day is today, but that's part of the whole attraction and that's a whole other conversation. Have you given much thought in terms of how Twitter and Facebook, just to name two, could police this stuff, stop it, or what do we need to do to Facebook and Twitter?

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah, it's tough because it is a new situation. But-- and Twitter is making its efforts. You know, Facebook is a different beast because it's so all-encompassing. And so really, it's a monopoly. It is a monopoly, as is Google. So you have the problems of monopoly, which is one set of problems. But then in the case of Facebook, you have a founder and controller or CEO who has made it clear he is unwilling to make any meaningful attempts, really, to figure out how this new, incredibly powerful platform will not be worse for society and humanity than better.

And it seems pretty clear to me that it's a net bad right now. And I'm not saying it's easy. You don't want suddenly a, you know, government censor reading every post on Facebook or whatever. But it's a new thing. You know, as people have said, it's like a magazine or Yahoo Finance or a television network news division in terms of people get their news and information from it. But they forswear any responsibility for what is said or done on it, you know?

So OK, that's a new situation, and I get that it's hard when you're that big and X billions of users and all that. But that doesn't mean we don't have to try to figure out how to do that. And there are technical means. There are all kinds of means. And obviously, they have pursued some of them at Facebook. But their-- his slash their-- Mark Zuckerberg's and their basic corporate instinct seems to be no, we're not going to do that. We're really not going to do that. Let a million flowers bloom even if 643,000 of them are toxic, you know?

ANDY SERWER: Our opium poppies. And by the way, if you see any, give us a call, and we'll probably take those out.

KURT ANDERSEN: There you go. Exactly, exactly.

ANDY SERWER: [INAUDIBLE] Maybe, maybe.

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah, unless that particular opium plantation is paying us quite a bit of money to grow them.

ANDY SERWER: Right, right. Flipping back to Donald Trump for a quick question, Kurt-- or maybe a long one-- are you surprised that President Trump only paid $750 in taxes in-- two years in a row?

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, I'm surprised that he paid any. I'm surprised at the number, to tell you the truth. I mean, like, I really want the conversation with the accountant or the lawyer or whomever in which they decide, eh, $750. That's-- what?

So am I surprised he paid no taxes? I mean, specifically, no. Because again-- and I was looking back just the last couple of days because of this big ""Times"" article and set of articles at the coverage-- the investigative-- financial investigative journalism that probably did back 29 years ago about him, and it's the same story, right? I mean, it's 29 years earlier, so it's not, obviously, the same story. And there was no ""Apprentice,"" which was really the place he's really made money over the years, but the same money-losing enterprises and using the tax systems' craziness to not have to pay taxes and all of it.

So no, you know, I mean-- and at this point-- and you asked earlier, does it surprise you that Donald Trump is president, yes and no. But nothing about his finances really surprises me. It would surprise me if he were paying-- it surprises me less that he paid $750 a year for two years than it would have if I'd read that he paid $30 million a year for the last few years. That would shock me.

ANDY SERWER: So a final question, Kurt, what are you up to next?

KURT ANDERSEN: Uh--

ANDY SERWER: --or now?

KURT ANDERSEN: I am working on a podcast history of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War, this limited series that I'm into and interested in. I am working on a television project for Disney+ and with Jeff Goldblum. I-- and I'm trying to figure out what my next book is going to be.

ANDY SERWER: It sounds like a pretty full plate to me.

KURT ANDERSEN: It's a good plate. It's a fine plate. It-- it was really good-- it was personally pleasurable for me, for all-- despite all the tragedy and horror of this pandemic, to have had this book ""Evil Geniuses"" come out-- I was-- I finished it literally, like, the day before the pandemic. I finished it in early February.

So I had the last six months, seven months just to, you know, edit it and promote it and come and get to talk to people like you about it. So it's filled my time. It's filled my pandemic pretty nicely.

ANDY SERWER: Good thing. All right, keep spinning those plates.

KURT ANDERSEN: Thanks.

ANDY SERWER: Kurt Andersen, author of the new book ""Evil Geniuses, The Unmaking of America."" Thank you very much.

KURT ANDERSEN: Thank you, Andy.

The online retail giant will lease three floors covering about 90,000 square feet (8,360 square meters) at Asia Square Tower 1 in the heart of the financial district, according to people with knowledge of the plans. Staff will move into the new offices early next year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.

Citigroup, currently the building’s largest tenant with nine floors, is trimming its office space to better use its real estate as its 10-year lease is due to expire soon, the people said.

Amazon’s plans in Singapore come as some of China’s biggest tech corporations such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. make the island state their beachhead for the rest of Asia. Singapore is becoming a regional base for both Western and Chinese companies because of its developed financial and legal system. It’s becoming more attractive to some as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong.

“Amazon is always in a state of innovation and disruption,” said Justin Tang, the head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Asia is a source of growth for them and they need to be near where their rivals are.”

Job Openings

Amazon currently has about 200 job openings in Singapore for roles covering data analytics, sales and advertising, business development, marketing and public relations, according to its career site.

A representative for Amazon declined to comment. A spokesman for Citigroup confirmed the bank is giving up the space, but declined to say which tenant is taking over. Some consumer banking staff and employees in other functions will relocate to Changi Business Park where the bank has bigger premises and a long-term lease, he said.

Amazon, which has been rapidly expanding in Singapore over recent years, has existing offices in Capital Square and One George Street. A lease for the space being taken in Asia Square Tower 1 would typically be for more than five years.

Cutting Costs

Citigroup is among financial firms around the world that are grappling with what post-pandemic working life will look like, with some companies such as Nomura Holdings Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp seeing opportunities to cut costly real estate by keeping a portion of staff at home.

Although the Singapore government has eased some restrictions around the virus such as allowing more workers to return to the office, remote work is still the default option.

Citigroup is reviewing its work spaces due to the virus and looking at other ways of working to allow flexible arrangements, the spokesman said.

The bank on Tuesday said it will open its biggest wealth management hub globally in Singapore in December as it aims for double-digit growth in the nation. ‘Citi Wealth Hub at 268 Orchard’ will open with space for more than 300 relationship managers and product specialists.

486,2020-09-29T01:10:25+00:00,Tata Group Courts Investors for New Digital Platform,"(Bloomberg) --

India’s Tata Group is in talks with potential investors about taking stakes in a new digital platform, people familiar with the matter said, seeking to modernize its consumer businesses as retail giants like Amazon.com Inc. and billionaire Mukesh Ambani pile into the country’s fledgling e-commerce market.

Tata Sons Pvt., the holding company of the $113 billion coffee-to-cars conglomerate, is working with advisers to explore bringing in financial or strategic investors, including global technology companies, the people said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak to the media. The group plans to bring together digital assets across various Tata businesses to create the new entity, according to the people.

A Tata Sons representative declined to comment on the stake sale discussions.

Tata’s platform -- an e-commerce gateway for its consumer products and services ranging from beverages to jewelry and resorts -- may seek to compete with the ambitious plans of Ambani, Amazon.com and Walmart Inc.’s Indian venture Flipkart to tap the nascent market of more than 1 billion consumers. Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd., is looking to forge a digital empire, raising more than $20 billion from big-name partners including Facebook Inc. and Google for his newly formed technology venture, Jio Platforms Ltd.

Discussions with potential investors are at a very early stage and there’s no certainty they will result in a deal, the people said.

Adding Heft

While bringing in outside investors would lend credence to Tata’s digital ambitions, it may also help the group pare debt after the coronavirus pandemic hammered its flagship businesses. Tata Steel Ltd.’s group net debt was at $14 billion as of June 30, while the net automotive debt of Tata Motors Ltd., which owns Jaguar Land Rover, was around 480 billion rupees ($6.5 billion).

Tata Group already has a bunch of entrenched consumer businesses, many of which also have an online presence. These include Tanishq’s jewelry stores, Titan watch showrooms, Star Bazaar supermarkets, chain of Taj hotels and a joint venture with Starbucks in India. The intention is to consolidate these currently fragmented web operations.

Story continues

As part of that drive, the conglomerate is building an all-in-one e-commerce app for its swathe of consumer products and services, Bloomberg News reported last month. It is expected to be launched by end-2020 or early next year.

Walmart is in talks with Tata about a possible investment in the planned app, Mint newspaper reported Tuesday, citing people it didn’t identify.

Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Tata Sons’ chairman and a long time chief executive officer of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. before that, is championing the group’s digitization drive and Tata Digital’s head Pratik Pal is in charge of building the all-in-one app, a person told Bloomberg News last month.

Pal has three decades of experience at TCS, where he was global head of retail, and helped with the digital transformation of some of the world’s largest retail chains including Walmart, Tesco Plc, Aldi Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy Co. and Marks & Spencer Group Plc.

490,2020-09-28T04:00:00+00:00,"Gaming, E-Commerce Deals Herald New Age for Polish Tech","(Bloomberg) -- A flurry of big-ticket gaming, e-commerce and telecoms announcements has focused the attention of tech investors on an unlikely destination: Poland.

Arguably better known for defending its smokestack industries from European Union climate goals, Poland has quietly developed a number of growing tech companies.

This month’s initial public offering by online marketplace Allegro is the biggest ever in Warsaw and worth as much as $2.7 billion. CD Projekt SA, Europe’s second-biggest biggest gaming company, plans to release its make-or-break futuristic Cyberpunk 2077 game in November, already dubbed as the most awaited launch this year. Mobile games producer Huuuge Inc. and People Can Fly SA, a studio that helped make Fortnite, also plan to list shares in Warsaw later this year.

While European governments have repeatedly tried and failed to create the continent’s own version of Silicon Valley, Poland’s digital remake is fed by local IT talent, an upwardly-mobile population and still low operational costs. The government has offered tax breaks for tech investments and switched to cloud technologies in partnership with Google Inc. and Microsoft Inc.

The change in consumer habits online has benefited companies beyond those purely focused on e-commerce. Advent International is considering the sale of Polish postal locker provider InPost SA, valuing the company -- that been boosted by an increase online shopping -- at about $2.3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

France’s Iliad SA is buying for $2.6 billion Polish mobile phone operator Play Communications SA, which has successfully disrupted rivals including local units of Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG.

Aman Ghei, principal at Finch Capital technology fund in London, said Poland’s IT industry has reached critical mass and its talent pool as “one of the best in Europe.” Still, it may be difficult to expect a large stream of public deals.

“For IPOs in local markets, you need serious scale -- and Allegro is a massive business well known to investors,” Ghei said by email. “It becomes a bit more challenging for enterprise software companies that are not well-known to the institutional and retail investor base as they need to provide free float for it to be a successful deal.”

Story continues

Part of the allure of Allegro, which makes money through fees for sellers who list products on its website, is that online still accounts for about 8% of retail sales in the country, about half as much as in the U.K. and a third of the share in China.

Another boon for the company, whose gross merchandise volume jumped 54% to 16 billion zloty ($4.1 billion) in the first half of 2020, is that Amazon.com Inc still sells to Polish consumers through its German subsidiary, limiting its appeal.

Allegro and CD Projekt together are set to become the two biggest Warsaw-listed companies -- highlighting the shift away from old-economy industrials and banks that have dominated the WIG20 index.

There is uncertainty about sustainability of the current boom. The accession to the European Union in 2004 allowed for access to broad markets, but also triggered a brain drain. Europe’s most-valued start-up, Swedish payment provider Klarna AB, was started by immigrant Pole Sebastian Siemiatkowski, and U.S. software house Snowflake Inc., co-founded by Marcin Zukowski.

For years, tech-savvy graduates have been a sought-after resource for companies relocating IT and data departments to Poland, where programmers’ salaries are still about half of paychecks in neighboring Germany. Some of them started to flourish with their own start-up ideas.

In 2006, two years after Poland joined the European Union, the founder of Huuuge, the mobile game maker with $260 million of sales last year, relocated his IT business from Finland to the western Polish city of Szczecin, just as Nokia started its decline as a European tech champion.

“Some peers considered that as a bold and risky move, which it certainly was,” Anton Gauffin said in email. “Those were the years where we learned how to build truly exceptional mobile games. Poland should be proud of its gaming talent.”

492,2020-09-24T14:06:27+00:00,Deliveroo Is Said to Start Talks for IPO After Delivery Spike,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. food-delivery startup Deliveroo has begun preliminary talks to explore an initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said.

The Amazon.com Inc.-backed company has had discussions with potential advisers regarding the possibility of an IPO in 2021, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. No final decisions have been made and Deliveroo may still decide against going ahead with listing plans, they said.

A representative for Deliveroo declined to comment.

Food delivery companies have been expanding rapidly, with rivals Just Eat Takeaway.com NV and Delivery Hero SE announcing acquisitions this year. U.K. regulators cleared Amazon’s investment in Deliveroo in August after a probe that lasted almost a year and froze the majority of a $575 million capital injection.

Although initially struggling at the start of the lockdown, Deliveroo got a boost as the year went on as customers avoided supermarkets and ordered takeout meals and groceries. Deliveroo was valued at more than $2 billion in 2017, but didn’t reveal a valuation after its latest investment round in May 2019. Deliveroo previously said sales from its food-delivery business grew 72% in 2018, reaching 476 million pounds ($607 million) for the year.

Launched in 2013, Deliveroo has become one of the U.K.’s main food delivery companies, alongside Uber Eats and Just Eat Takeaway. These companies have been expanding into grocery delivery, with Waitrose and Deliveroo recently teaming up to offer quick deliveries of select goods.

Uber Eats and Deliveroo are also battling for so-called virtual restaurants, where eateries lease kitchen space to prepare food for couriers. With no dining rooms or wait staff, these outfits pop up where food delivery companies expect demand, and sell their meals through Uber Eats or Deliveroo’s app.

494,2020-09-24T01:31:19+00:00,"China Has a New Richest Person, With Jack Ma Dethroned","(Bloomberg) -- A bottled-water and vaccine tycoon has become China’s wealthiest person in a day also marked by massive losses among the world’s tech elite.

Zhong Shanshan’s net worth reached $58.7 billion on Wednesday, $2 billion more than Jack Ma’s, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Zhong is now Asia’s second-richest person, behind India’s Mukesh Ambani, and is the 17th wealthiest in the world, ahead of Charles Koch and Phil Knight.

Nicknamed “Lone Wolf” for his eschewing of politics and clubby business groups, Zhong’s fortune has jumped $51.9 billion in 2020, more than anyone else in the world except Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk. Both suffered heavy declines on Wednesday as tech stocks stumbled and Tesla plunged after its “Battery Day” event fell short of expectations. Musk’s fortune dropped by almost $10 billion.

The initial public offering of bottled-water company Nongfu Spring Co. -- which turned out to be Hong Kong’s most popular among retail investors -- propelled Zhong to China’s top three richest earlier this month. That came after the April listing of vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co. pushed his net worth to $20 billion by early August.

Zhong now leads a wealth ranking in China that is typically dominated by people who made their fortunes from tech companies.

While Zhong has surpassed Ma as China’s wealthiest, the tech tycoon might soon regain the top spot, which he’s held for most of the past six years after Alibaba went public in the U.S. Ant Group’s IPO next month is poised to boost his fortune, with his stake estimated at $28 billion if the company achieves the $250 billion valuation people familiar with the matter have said it’s targeting.

Wednesday was brutal for U.S. tech stocks, which tumbled the most since earlier this month. The plunge in Musk’s wealth was the biggest among the people on the Bloomberg ranking of the world’s 500 richest, followed by Bezos, whose net worth dropped by $7.1 billion. Musk is now worth $93.2 billion and Bezos $178 billion. Zhong added almost $4 billion Wednesday, more than anyone else in the index.

* RBNZ cash rate decision later in the day

Sept 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares gained more than 1% on Wednesday, tracking an overnight tech-led rebound on Wall Street, while easing border restrictions due to dwindling COVID-19 cases in Queensland and New South Wales also helped boost investor sentiment.

The S&P/ASX 200 index climbed 1.3% to 5,861.70 by 0030 GMT. The benchmark closed 0.7% lower on Tuesday.

Major Wall Street indexes Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 and Nasdaq all finished the previous session on a stronger note, led by a jump in Amazon following a stock upgrade to ""outperform"" by brokerage Bernstein.

Back home, the state of Queensland said it would open its borders to parts of neighbouring New South Wales, the country's most populous state, amid growing confidence that a second wave of infections in the country has been contained.

Market sentiment was also supported by the Reserve Bank of Australia's indication of it assessing various monetary policy options to support the country's economic recovery.

The healthcare index was top gainer, rising as much as 1.8% to its highest since Sept. 3, with drugmaker CSL Ltd rising 1.5%, and Healius advancing 2.6% to touch its peak in more than two years.

The heavyweight financial sector climbed as much as 1.5%, set for its best session since Sept. 3. Almost all the components of the index were trading higher, with the ""Big Four"" banks up about 1% each.

Energy stocks edged over 1% higher, helped by a rise in oil prices.

Santos gained about 0.8%, while Woodside Petroleum jumped more than 1%.

498,2020-09-23T00:20:39+00:00,A $50 Phone is Ambani's Weapon to Dominate India Telecom Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd. has asked local suppliers to ramp up production capacity in India so they can make as many as 200 million smartphones over the next two years, according to people familiar with the matter, a potentially enormous boost for the country’s technology ambitions and a warning shot to rivals such as Xiaomi Corp.

India’s most valuable company is in talks with domestic assemblers to make a version of its Jio phone that would run on Google’s Android and cost about 4,000 rupees ($54), said the people, asking not to be identified since the plans are private. The inexpensive phones will be marketed with low-cost wireless plans from Reliance Jio, the parent company’s carrier, they said.

Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani is aiming to remake the country’s smartphone industry much like he did in wireless services, where his aggressive prices and simple plans quickly made him the dominant force. The billionaire is also aligning himself with the Indian government’s plans to build more domestic manufacturing, a possible boost for local assemblers like Dixon Technologies India, Lava International and Karbonn Mobiles.

“We are of course trying to build our domestic companies. We have a sweet spot in entry level phones,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular & Electronic Association, during an interview on Bloomberg Television. “The world has realized that India is a great place to do business and a great place to do manufacturing also.”

In a sign that Ambani’s revving up his mobile campaign, Jio on Tuesday introduced a range of plans that, for as low as 399 rupees, offers not just data but also subscriptions to services from Netflix to Amazon Prime. Representatives for Reliance declined to comment on its production goals.

Reliance’s target of selling 150 million to 200 million phones over two years would represent a massive boost for local factories. India assembled an estimated 165 million smartphones in the year ended March, and about an equal number of basic feature phones, according to Mohindroo’s association. About a fifth of the smartphones cost less than 7,000 rupees, or about $100.

Story continues

Reliance rival Bharti Airtel is also in talks with assemblers to build its own 4G device, local media has reported. The Business Standard reported earlier that Ambani was considering outsourcing phone-making.

Reliance in July struck a broad alliance with Google, in which the Alphabet Inc. unit would invest $4.5 billion and cooperate on technology initiatives. The partnership is still under regulatory review so Reliance is proceeding with the mobile phone initiative on its own for now.

Ambani has drawn more than $20 billion in investments from U.S. giants like Facebook Inc. for Jio Platforms Pvt, whose subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is placing the order. It’s worked with assemblers on prototypes for at least two years in secret and can bring a phone rapidly to market, though it’s likely to miss the November Diwali shopping season, the people said.

If Reliance succeeds in popularizing the new gadget, it could lift the prospects for Jio Platforms, accelerating Ambani’s efforts to build an empire spanning e-commerce, social media and games. Many of Jio’s nearly 400 million users use no-frills second-generation devices, paying $2 monthly for voice and data -- a large potential market for the new device. It could eventually erode the market share of Chinese phonemakers such as Xiaomi.

“Jio has an opportunity to target more than half billion Indians who don’t own a smartphone and trigger a blue ocean market opportunity,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research. “With Reliance expected to work with Indian vendors, Chinese brands will lose out on a potential opportunity and market share.”

Read more: Amazon and Ambani’s Jio Are Spoiling for an Epic India Fight

Reliance’s own requirements could hover around 5 million gadgets per month initially, but no single Indian company currently has that kind of capacity so the order will get split between multiple assemblers, the people said. At least two domestic smartphone makers are in discussions with the telecom giant, the people added.

Phones have become essential for accessing lite versions of apps from WhatsApp to YouTube in a country with an average GDP per capita of around $2,000. That’s why basic devices costing between $100 and $250 accounted for three-quarters of sales in the second quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint.

Reliance’s fourth-generation wireless gadgets -- one tier below 5G -- are aimed at the estimated 350 million users of basic or feature phones that now dominate India’s industry. Speaking at an industry event a few weeks ago, Ambani said millions were “trapped in the 2G era.”

“Their feature phones keep them excluded, even from the basic uses of internet at a time where both India and the rest of the world are standing at the doorsteps of 5G telephony,” he said.

The pandemic is spurring people to upgrade and creating new market opportunities. For example, parents are anxious to put a device in the hands of their kids so they can keep up with online lessons. There’re an estimated 250 million children between the ages of 6 and 16, according to UNICEF.

“If they’re successful in getting even 10% of this base to upgrade, Jio can become one of the leading smartphone brands of 2021,” Shah said.

Among stocks that pay dividends to shareholders, most do so on a quarterly basis. But there are other directions a company can take with its capital return policy. Some companies decide to pay a dividend once per year, while others pay semi-annually. There are even monthly dividend stocks.

Income investors may find monthly dividend stocks to be attractive, as they pay 12 dividends per year. Monthly dividend stocks deliver more frequent income payments than stocks with other payout schedules.

Realty Income is the safest monthly dividend stock on this list due to the company’s long history of consistent dividends. The company has paid 602 consecutive monthly dividends without interruption, a track record stretching back more than 50 years. It’s no surprise that Realty Income has trademarked itself as “The Monthly Dividend Company.”

Realty Income also has a long history of consistently raising its dividend over time. Realty Income has increased its dividend 107 times since its initial public offering in 1994. Realty Income qualifies as a Dividend Aristocrat, a group of 65 companies in the S&P 500 that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.

Story continues

Since its initial public listing in 1994, the company has increased its dividend on average by 4.5% per year. This means Realty Income has delivered consistent dividends each quarter and provided dividend growth for an extended period.

Realty Income’s diversified property portfolio is a big reason for its impressive dividend history. Realty Income is a triple-net lease REIT, an attractive structure for REITs to follow. Being a triple-net lease REIT means that Realty Income collects steady rent payments each month, while three major cost components — maintenance, insurance and taxes — are the responsibility of the tenant. Realty Income’s diversified portfolio consists of over 6,500 properties spread across roughly 600 tenants, with an average remaining lease term of 9 years.

The company’s high-quality portfolio has served as a competitive advantage during the coronavirus crisis. Realty Income collected 93.5% of its contractual rent in August, up from 92.3% in July. Investors have some reason for hope that the worst is over for Realty Income, which has an attractive yield of 4.2% right now.

STAG Industrial is a safe dividend stock because of its advantageous business model. STAG Industrial is a REIT with a particular focus on industrial real estate properties, many of which have exposure to e-commerce activity, an especially attractive feature for long-term REIT investors.

Many REITs are highly exposed to areas of brick-and-mortar real estate that are in distress, such as malls. These property types were already under pressure entering 2020 due to the rise of e-commerce retailers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic only accelerated secular e-commerce trends. As a result, STAG is an excellent stock for REIT investors looking for long-term growth potential.

STAG Industrial’s property portfolio included 457 buildings in 30 different states as of June 30, 2020. According to the company, approximately 43% of its property portfolio handles e-commerce activity. In fact, Amazon is its largest tenant, comprising 2.5% of annualized base rent. Other major tenants such as XPO Logistics and Packaging (NYSE:XPO) will also benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce.

Importantly, STAG Industrial has a healthy balance sheet to help support the dividend. The company has a manageable leverage ratio of 4.3x, as defined by net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, down from 4.8x in 2019. It also has just 12% of outstanding debt maturing before 2022.

STAG Industrial collected 98% of rent in the second quarter, an excellent sign that the company is not being negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. With a 4.5% yield and a projected payout ratio of 76% for 2020, we view STAG’s dividend as very safe.

Shaw Communications is a major communications company based out of Canada. It has become Western Canada’s leading content and network provider, with over $4 billion USD in annual revenue. The company delivers wireline and wireless services to consumers and businesses in Canada. The wireless business operates under the Freedom Mobile brand.

Shaw Communications is uniquely positioned to succeed in the current environment. While many industries are under heavy stress due to the coronavirus pandemic, demand for wireless, video and broadband service only continues to rise. For example, in the most recently reported quarter, Shaw Communication’s consolidated revenue decreased by just 0.8%. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% year-over-year, while postpaid churn rate was a record low 0.96%. Average revenue per user increased 2.6% for the quarter.

Over the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, Shaw Communications grew its free cash flow by 20%. Such strong growth was due to resilient subscriber numbers and higher revenue per user, as well as lower capital expenditures and falling interest expense.

Shaw Communications has a health balance sheet, with an investment-grade credit rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor’s. It also has a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.4x, which is actually below its target range of 2.5x to 3.0x. The company also has $2.1 billion CAD in available liquidity and no debt maturities until 2023, meaning short-term liquidity is not a concern for Shaw Communications.

The company’s strong performance gives investors confidence that the dividend is safe, even in a prolonged recession. The stock has an attractive dividend yield of nearly 5%.

TransAlta Renewables (TRSWF) a hand holding a lightbulb on a green background to represent renewable energy stocks

TransAlta Renewables is a top pick, as the stock not only pays a safe dividend each month, but it also provides investors with long-term growth potential.

TransAlta Renewables is a renewable independent power producer based in Canada. It has a diversified portfolio of assets including interests in 23 wind facilities, 13 hydroelectric facilities, seven natural gas generation facilities, one solar facility and one natural gas pipeline.

In all, the company cumulatively has an ownership interest of over 2,500 megawatts of generating capacity. Its assets are spread across the U.S., Canada and Western Australia. Therefore, TransAlta Renewables could be a particularly attractive stock for investors given its exposure to renewable energy, a long-term growth industry.

TransAlta has a successful track record, as its annual Cash Available for Distribution (CAD) has more than tripled since 2014. Investors have benefited right alongside this growth. Since TransAlta’s initial public offering in 2013, the company has increased its annualized dividend by 4% per year.

There is a long runway of growth up ahead, as the renewable energy transformation is still in the early stages. TransAlta’s future pipeline consists of 2,000 megawatts of capacity currently under evaluation. Separately, it also has 900 megawatts of additional capacity under consideration for on-site generation projects in the U.S., Canada and Australia.

In the meantime, investors are rewarded with a hefty dividend currently near 6%. TransAlta has a modest net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.2x, reassuring investors that debt is not a major concern.

With a projected dividend payout ratio of 65% in terms of 2020 expected adjusted funds from operation, we view TransAlta Renewable’s dividend as safe.

Dream Industrial REIT (DREUF) a businessperson holds an imaginary blueprint of a house

Dream Industrial REIT owns high-quality light industrial properties. The trust owns and operates a portfolio of 262 geographically diversified light industrial properties, which makes up ~26 million square feet of gross leasable area across Canada, with some operations in the United States. The trust’s portfolio includes roughly 63% of its gross leasable area in multi-tenant buildings and the remaining 37% in single-tenant buildings.

Dream Industrial currently has a focus on driving occupancy and rental rates, furthering its leasing operations and internal growth. Occupancy stood at 96% as of the second quarter of 2020. Further, as of September 4, Dream Industrial had collected approximately 98% of recurring contractual gross rents due for the second quarter and July 2020 after adjusting for agreed-upon deferrals and Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance.

Similar to STAG Industrial, Dream Industrial is optimally positioned to benefit from emerging trends such as e-commerce, which has driven increased demand for industrial real estate properties. Approximately 43% of Dream Industrial’s property portfolio consists of distribution centers, with 39% of properties in urban logistics and the remaining 18% in light industrial properties.

Dream Industrials’ focus on industrial properties seeing growing demand has paid off, as the company grew first-half Funds From Operation by 9.5% year-over-year, a highly impressive performance in an extremely challenging environment.

One potential risk factor is the company’s elevated debt level. Its net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio stood at 5.4x in the 2020 second quarter. While this is higher than investors would like to see, it represents a significant decline from 8.4x as recently as 2016.

Fortunately, the company has limited maturities over the next several years, as well as an available $250 million credit facility to help shore up its liquidity.

Dream Industrials stock has an attractive dividend yield above 6%. As long as FFO continues to grow due to increasing demand for e-commerce activity, the dividend appears secure.

Choice Properties REIT (PPRQF) a person standing in a shopping mall with a bag in their hand

Choice Properties invests in commercial real estate properties across Canada. The company has a high-quality real estate portfolio of over 700 properties, including retail, industrial, office, multi-family and development assets. Over 500 of Choice Properties’ investments are rented to their largest tenant Loblaw, Canada’s largest retailer.

On July 20, Choice Properties released second-quarter results that showed resilience during a difficult operating environment. Funds From Operations, a highly crucial measure of cash flow for REITs, declined 19% from the same quarter last year. The decline in FFO per-diluted-unit was largely due to a higher weighted average number of units outstanding, as well as the disposition of a 30-property portfolio.

The trust is also assisting smaller tenants with rent deferrals for 60 days as well as by participating in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program. Still, Choice Properties collected 89% of rents in the second quarter and 94% of rents in July, indicating that they are weathering the COVID-19 conditions relatively well.

On an adjusted basis excluding various one-time items from the company’s financial results, Choice Properties generated FFO of $0.404 per share over the first six months of 2020. This sufficiently covered the company’s per-share dividend payout. Choice Properties maintained a dividend payout ratio of 91.6% in the 2020 first half.

While this is a fairly high payout ratio, the dividend remained covered and if adjusted FFO continues to recover the dividend payout will decline in future periods. With a nearly 6% yield, Choice Properties is attractive for investors looking for high yields.

Main Street Capital (MAIN) A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.

Main Street Capital operates as a Business Development Company, which means it makes money by providing financing to privately-held companies. It focuses on lower middle-market companies, generally defined as those generating between $10 million and $150 million in annual revenue.

As of June 30, Main Street’s investment portfolio consisted of 177 companies, with no individual investment representing more than 3.7% of total investment income. Main Street’s investments typically support management buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments, refinancing and acquisitions.

The over-arching business strategy for Main Street is to earn a high rate of profit on its investments and returning significant cash to its own shareholders through dividends. The company has never decreased its monthly dividend rate and in fact has grown the payout steadily over the years. For example, Main Street’s monthly dividend has increased 86% from $0.11 per share in 2007 to the current level of $0.205 per share.

This is a particularly challenging time for Main Street. The coronavirus crisis has had an extremely negative impact on the global economy, which has also affected many of its portfolio investments. In addition, the low interest rate environment has also resulted in lower investment yields. These twin headwinds have resulted in poor performance to begin 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, Main Street’s distributable net investment income fell 19% year-over-year. On a per-share basis, distributable NII fell 22% to $0.52 per share.

Over the first half of 2020, net investment income per share declined 18% from the same six-month period last year. The company paid dividends of $1.23 per share over the first half of the year, while generating NII-per-share of $1.04 in the same period. Therefore, coverage of the dividend has fallen below 100%, which poses a risk of a dividend cut.

That said, there is reason to believe the worst is behind Main Street. Gradual reopening of the economy has led to significant improvement in economic conditions in recent months. And, Main Street has taken appropriate action to raise capital, such as a recent $125 million bond offering, to improve its liquidity in the near-term.

Main Street’s dividend safety has been weakened by the coronavirus crisis, but assuming the worst is behind us, an improvement in net investment income could once again sufficiently cover the dividend. Main Street has an attractive dividend yield of 8%.

Final Thoughts

The coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the global economy. While the stock market has virtually recovered all of its losses from earlier in the year, the broader economy is by no means out of the woods. Therefore, investors should be more selective when picking high-yield stocks. There are never any guarantees when it comes to the stock market and while a continued downturn in the economy could jeopardize monthly dividend stocks’ dividend payments, we believe these seven monthly dividend stocks have sustainable payouts.

508,2020-09-17T05:00:00+00:00,INSIGHT-The Musk Method: Learn from partners then go it alone,"* Investors awaiting 'Battery Day' announcements on Sept. 22

* Musk has hinted at significant new battery developments

* Partners and acquisitions have helped give Tesla an edge (Updates sourcing for paragraph 35)

By Paul Lienert, Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is hailed as an innovator and disruptor who went from knowing next to nothing about building cars to running the world's most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years.

But his record shows he is more of a fast learner who forged alliances with firms that had technology Tesla lacked, hired some of their most talented people, and then powered through the boundaries that limited more risk-averse partners.

Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla's drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its ""Battery Day"" event on Sept. 22.

Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.

New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan's Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.

""Elon doesn't want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,"" said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. ""And for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.""

Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea's LG Chem and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.

But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs — at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.

Story continues

""There has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,"" Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.

""Our relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There's no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.""

Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

MAKE EVERYTHING

Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk's goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla's control, people familiar with Tesla's strategy said.

They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co's iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.

""Elon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,"" said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. ""He wanted to make everything.""

Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.

""Tell him 'No', and then he really wants to do it,"" said a third former Tesla veteran.

The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.

Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.

'STRAIGHT FOR MARS'

Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada ""Gigafactory"", while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla's Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.

Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.

But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn't happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.

Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.

The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.

During its development alliance with Germany's Daimler , which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.

Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.

""He learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,"" said a senior Daimler engineer said.

Meanwhile, an association with Japan's Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.

Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.

THE MUSK SPIN

Some relationships did not end well, however.

Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla's Autopilot.

""Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,"" said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.

Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.

But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.

At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla's Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.

By Paul Lienert, Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is hailed as an innovator and disruptor who went from knowing next to nothing about building cars to running the world's most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years.

But his record shows he is more of a fast learner who forged alliances with firms that had technology Tesla lacked, hired some of their most talented people, and then powered through the boundaries that limited more risk-averse partners.

Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla's drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its ""Battery Day"" event on Sept. 22.

Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.

New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan's Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.

""Elon doesn't want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,"" said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. ""And for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.""

Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea's LG Chem and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.

But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs — at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.

Story continues

""There has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,"" Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.

""Our relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There's no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.""

Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

MAKE EVERYTHING

Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk's goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla's control, people familiar with Tesla's strategy said.

They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co's iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.

""Elon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,"" said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. ""He wanted to make everything.""

Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.

""Tell him 'No', and then he really wants to do it,"" said a third former Tesla veteran.

The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.

Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.

'STRAIGHT FOR MARS'

Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada ""Gigafactory"", while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla's Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.

Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.

But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn't happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.

Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.

The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.

During its development alliance with Germany's Daimler , which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.

Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.

""He learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,"" said a senior Daimler engineer said.

Meanwhile, an association with Japan's Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.

Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.

THE MUSK SPIN

Some relationships did not end well, however.

Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla's Autopilot.

""Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,"" said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.

Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.

But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.

At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla's Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.

The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.

U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.

""Nvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,"" said Nvidia's senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.

NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Equity markets rose and the dollar firmed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, as expected, and said it would continue its bond-buying program to stimulate the U.S. economy as part of a dovish policy stance.

Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose and gold prices edged higher after the Fed promised to keep rates on hold until inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the U.S. central bank's 2% inflation target ""for some time.""

""They want to be dovish. They want to be super dovish. The market is priced for dovish,"" said Nancy Davis, managing partner and chief investment officer at Quadratic Capital Management LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.

""Nobody thinks there's going to be any kind of inflation at all and the guidance is more dovish and in line with what the market expected,"" Davis said, adding that she believes there is a danger inflation could exceed expectations.

New economic projections released with the Fed's policy statement showed rates on hold through at least 2023, with inflation never breaching 2% over that time. Policymakers saw the economy shrinking 3.7% this year, far less steep than the 6.5% decline forecast in June. Unemployment, which registered 8.4% in August, was seen falling to 7.6% by the end of the year.

At the Fed's last meeting in August the U.S. central bank adopted a new approach to inflation and unemployment that will allow the economy to run a little hotter than in the past to help ensure jobs growth for lower income earners.

MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets rose 0.25% to 577.1, while its emerging markets index rose 0.48%.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.72% and the S&P 500 gained 0.20%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.45%, pulled lower by declines in Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp - stocks that have propelled the index to record highs this year.

In Europe, the broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.49% at 1,446.16. London's FTSE 100 lagged gains by other European indices, down 0.44% at the close, but the struggling pound was propped up by a weaker dollar.

European retail stocks surged on strong results from Zara-owner Inditex after it said there was a progressive return to normality, with online sales growing sharply and store sales recovering. Shares of the Spanish retailer jumped 8.1%.

U.S. consumer spending slowed in August, with retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services sliding 0.1% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in July.

Retail sales lost a little steam in August, but consumers overall are still doing well despite modest weakness relative to expectations, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial at Troy, Michigan.

When the pandemic slowed economic growth, consumers were in a relatively strong financial condition, the direct opposite of what is normally the case for an economic downturn, he said.

""Consumers are still overall doing well despite the modest weakness relative to expectations,"" Price said.

The yen rose overnight and extended gains that hit a nearly seven-week high of 104.995 to the dollar as investors sought safer assets.

The dollar index rose 0.016%, with the euro down 0.34% to $1.1805.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.44% versus the greenback at 104.95 per dollar.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1.2 basis points to 0.6871%.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.2% at $1,970.50 an ounce. Spot gold prices rose 0.14% to $1,958.26 an ounce.

Brent crude futures rose $1.69 to settle at $42.22 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures settled up $1.88 at $40.16 a barrel.

Zinc prices pushed toward a 16-month highs hit earlier this month as resurgent Chinese industry bolstered the outlook for demand and the yuan strengthened, making metals more affordable for Chinese buyers.

Oil prices rose for a second day, up more than 2%, as Hurricane Sally closed U.S. offshore production and an industry report showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly decreased.

511,2020-09-11T06:52:48+00:00,These Tiny Space Warriors Trump Tesla in Stock Market Race,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Thanks to Brexit and a dearth of racy, homegrown tech companies, the U.K. stock market has gone pretty much nowhere over the past five years. By comparison, an investor who bought an S&P 500 Index fund and reinvested dividends would have almost doubled their money.(2)

Happily, there’s a British company whose stock market performance has done miles better than that, outstripping even Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. Remarkably, the core of this business is unashamedly analogue, not digital.

I’m talking about Games Workshop Group Plc, the Nottingham-based manufacturer of tabletop, post-apocalyptic fantasy game Warhammer 40,000. Surprisingly high quarterly sales and profit, coupled with the promise of a chunky payout, lifted the shares by another 10% on Thursday, swelling the market capitalization to 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion). That’s more than U.K. high street clothing and food giant Marks & Spencer Group Plc.

The stock has gained almost 1,600% over the past five years and shareholders who reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 2,140% return, by far the best performance on the FTSE All-Share Index. In percentage terms only two Nasdaq 100 constituents — Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — have done better in the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Besides BlackRock Inc., Games Workshop’s largest shareholder is JP Morgan Chase & Co.’s asset management arm. Could it be that Jamie Dimon is a fan of miniature space marines and monsters?

For the uninitiated (I include myself in that description), Warhammer hobbyists purchase small plastic goblins and orcs and spend countless hours painting the miniatures and modeling fantastical landscapes. Battles are fought either at home or at one of the company’s retail outlets. The outcome is decided by rolling dice, along with the player’s tactics and strategic acumen, of course.

You might think this niche type of gaming would struggle in the era of elaborate and free-to-play mobile games such as Fortnite and Call of Duty. Social distancing rules have made it harder to meet up with groups of friends. But the in-person dynamic is clearly something Games Workshop is proud of. “Our games are played between people present in a room, not with a screen. They are truly social and build a real sense of community and comradeship,” the company states on its website. Collecting a mighty army doesn’t come cheap either — a potential problem during a recession.

Story continues

Yet business is booming, thanks to online sales and the company’s efforts to engage and connect players via social media and its website. Users of the Warhammer-community site increased by almost 40% to more than 8 million last year.

As with jigsaw puzzles, painting miniature space warriors is even more appealing when lockdowns mean there’s little to do in the “real world.” The company also publishes an extensive line of books. Of the 270 million pounds of total annual revenue, about three-quarters comes from overseas; North America is now the largest market. Teenagers aren’t the only target demographic — grown-ups are fanatical about the game too. It helps the hit Netflix TV series Stranger Things has given tabletop gaming a sprinkling of retro cool. Dungeons & Dragons, first created in the 1970s and now owned by Hasbro Inc., features prominently in the show.

Games Workshop stands out not just because of its unusual line of business for a high-flying stock, but also its conservative management style. Its financial statements are a model of clarity and devoid of flattering adjustments that feature all too prominently in many companies’ disclosures.

The company doesn’t have any debt and investments are funded entirely from its own cash flows. It’s all refreshingly old-school.

Thanks to a large cash buffer, Games Workshop didn’t face financial difficulties when its stores and factory were forced to close for several weeks in the spring. So it’s able to keep paying dividends. Sadly few U.K. retailers can say the same right now. (1)Operating profit margins are an astonishing 33%, or about the same as Facebook Inc. The retail outlets typically have just one enthusiast employee, which keeps costs down.

Of course, Games Workshop’s valuation is now well beyond what one might describe as restrained. The 42 times forward earnings multiple is a lot for a business that says it can’t know for sure what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be. Games Workshop already earns chunky royalties from licensing its intellectual property for use in video games and has talked about doing the same for television. Most of the latter type of projects remain at an early stage though.

Still, if someone tells you the high street has a dark future, remind them that selling table-top battle games is a path paved with gold, as well as gore.

513,2020-09-09T20:40:12+00:00,‘There’s good value to be had’ for tech ETFs: Expert,"Yahoo Finance's Kristin Myers and Head of ETF and Mutual Fund Research at CFRA, Todd Rosenbluth, discuss the risk in investing in tech ETFs as the sector loses steam this week.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: --on research at CFRA. So Todd, I want to start off about the selloff that we saw, of course, led by tech. Now in the run up, a lot of people said, well, frankly some of these tech stocks are a little too expensive, so chose instead to get some exposure via tech ETFs. Now we're seeing we had this pullback, the rotation that we're seeing in the market. Are tech ETFs a little bit too risky to hold right now?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: No. We at CFRA still think there's good value to be had. We like technology ETFs. For example, XLK is it technology select sector spider. If you're going to buy tech ETFs, you really have to like Apple and Microsoft. Those are the two heavyweights, very concentrated portfolio.

We at CFRA have a bullish recommendation still on those companies, as well as companies like Visa that are also part of the portfolio. So we still think there's a good opportunity to be invested, but with the benefits of diversification using technology-- certain technology ETFs.

KRISTIN MYERS: So to that point, because I was reading your note, you don't see tech underperforming next year. And you're actually recommending that investors overweight the sector. I'm wondering what you're seeing coming up through to the end of 2020, but even ahead in 2021, any if there is at all a concern, perhaps, of a larger pullback coming in the next couple of months.

TODD ROSENBLUTH: Well, there's always going to be pullbacks that take place that give, perhaps, buying opportunities. We at CFRA have a few overweight recommended sectors, technology being one of them, communication services. Those are the more growth-oriented sectors that we like, and health care and consumer staples that are more defensive. So we do think you want to balance your portfolio out with both cyclical, risk-on, as well as more defensive, risk-off areas.

Story continues

Where we think there's still room to be had-- Apple has been performing very well, but has some news that's likely to be coming out that could drive the company forward. We think Microsoft has been a big beneficiary of the trend towards cloud. And again, those are the two heavyweight companies.

But there's also some good opportunities further-- slightly further down the market cap spectrum and with ETFs like XLK or VGT, which is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. You get that diversification. Or you can get a little bit more targeted with some more industry or thematic-oriented ETFs.

KRISTIN MYERS: Looking through your note, I was struck by the fact that energy ETFs most popular. And given the fact that energy has been lagging the broader market, what do you think has been behind that trend?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: So bottom fishing is likely what's happening. Investors have been looking to take the value opportunities and hope that there's going to be a recovery that's faster than expected. You're right XLE, which is the energy select sector spider, year-to-date through August had more inflows than technology-oriented ETFs.

The irony is that its asset base is largely flat where it was at the beginning of the year, despite having over $3 and 1/2 billion of net inflows. So 35%, give or take, of the assets grew because the portfolio was down more than 35%. So not a good investment. It has not worked out for many people.

But it's a sign that energy, as well as utilities, which was an area that's been underperforming-- investors are becoming more tactical this year, using sector-oriented ETFs. It's typically been a part of the ETF lineup. But it's increasingly been used as investors want to be focused on certain sectors, either growth or more value-oriented defensive sectors.

KRISTIN MYERS: So quickly, before I run out of time with you, Todd, I want to ask about actively-managed ETFs. They're growing in popularity. Do you think investors are better served with active management?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: Well, we're certainly seeing more of them. So we've had new entrants, like T. Rowe Price, enter the ETF market. We've got Fidelity and American Century. If you believe in active management, and there are many people who still think you can find value in outperforming the broader market, you get the tax efficiency benefits and liquidity that you're used to with ETFs. So really excited about what's happening. We've got some other players that are lined up to come to market, like JPMorgan, with active ETFs like this, as well as Invesco.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, thank you for joining us today.

The world's largest package delivery company plans to hire about the same number of seasonal holiday helpers as last year. It expects this year's peak season to extend from October to January - one month longer than last year, as retailers prep for their earliest-ever kickoff.

Target, Best Buy and Kohl's have moved winter holiday promotions up to as early as October. They also joined rival Walmart in announcing store closures on Thanksgiving and plans to bypass the midnight Black Friday door-buster sales that traditionally mark the start of the holiday shopping crush but now pose the risk of fueling COVID-19 infections.

UPS, FedEx Corp, DHL and rising rival Amazon.com Inc since March have been inundated with demand for package deliveries as virus-wary shoppers shift purchases of everything from groceries to furniture online.

During the second quarter, average daily volume for the domestic package unit at UPS was 21.1 million, more than 91% of what it was during the fourth-quarter holiday peak. That volume was 17.2 million in the second quarter of 2019.

The Atlanta-based company responded to the surge by hiring about 39,000 permanent U.S. workers in the latest quarter. It also is investing in automation.

The Japanese government approved on Tuesday spending from emergency budget reserves to secure coronavirus vaccines, which supported investor sentiment.

522,2020-09-03T16:20:29+00:00,Why the explosive stock market rally is suddenly crumbling,"A red-hot stock market may be starting to get crushed under the weight of its own inflated valuation.

Seemingly out of the blue, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked nearly 800 points on Thursday by early afternoon trading. More alarmingly, the Nasdaq Composite — which has led the rally off the late February lows — plunged about 4%.

Some of the sector’s strongest-performers in recent months were walloped Thursday: Amazon (-5%), Apple (-7%), Microsoft (-5%), Tesla (-7%), Zoom (-11%), Square (-7%) to name a few. Indeed the selloff in these tech giants has served as a red flag on the rally’s near-term sustainability for the bulls, which have also watched an under-the-radar rotation into more defensive names this week such as Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola.

Talk to those on the Street and a selloff right now makes sense, and is long overdue.

For starters, valuations on big tech names like Tesla have gotten completely out of whack with reasonable expectations on forward earnings. A signal on that front was sent on Tesla Wednesday, as one of its largest shareholders Baillie Gifford trimmed its stake after a meteoric run-up in the stock. Meantime, billionaire investor Mario Gabelli hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer he may soon trim some of his position in Apple (another 2020 high-flyer).

And then there is the raw economic data that hasn’t improved much in recent weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. Or at least hasn’t turned around enough to warrant the S&P 500 trading at a lofty forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22 times.

“It could be the start [of a correction],” Belpointe Asset Management chief strategist David Nelson told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. “I don’t think the stock market — and particularly the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — really represents what is going on in the economy.” Exterior of New York Stock Exchange Building with classical architecture of Greece columns and US flags as seen during the day, NYSE Financial organization at Wall Street a symbol for the global and American Economy as one of the most powerful financial institute at lower Manhattan New York City, United States of America.

To top it all off, there are the seasonal September forces — and what will be a heated presidential election — the bulls seem to have forgotten about.

Story continues

September tends to be a weak month for stocks historically. In fact, according to LPL Financial, September has been the worst-performing month for markets, on average, since 1950. The S&P 500 has dropped about 1% on average that month since 1950, LPL Financial data shows. The only other month to record a drop on average (and a minuscule one at that) going back to 1950 is August.

But this time around, September being lackluster for markets could be further solidified because of election-related uncertainty. LPL Financial data reveals that the S&P 500 has shed 0.2% on average in an election year.

“When we look at Tesla, it’s trading at a market cap of $455 billion which is 10 times what General Motors is trading at. And so we have to wonder can fundamental analysis sustains some of these valuations? When we look at Zoom, it’s trading at more than IBM and at a P/E ratio of over 500 times versus IBM at 15 times. What I think is happening is investors are starting to scrutinize the valuations a bit more,” says Greg Branch, an adviser at 1847 Financial.

Sentiment was also supported by gains in broader equities, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan climbing 0.5% after data showed a sustained recovery in China's services sector.

The Nifty Auto index rose 1.34%, with Tata Motors Ltd advancing 2.6% to its highest since February after reporting higher August sales.

The Nifty Bank index fell 0.7%, led by a 1.8% drop in ICICI Bank Ltd, as India's top court was set to continue hearing a case today on waiving interest rates on loans under a moratorium.

What Happened: The talks came to a halt as a ruling was expected from the Indian Supreme Court on staggered payments due from the Indian telecom firm, which could have led to an existential crisis for the company, Mint reported.

Vodafone Idea reportedly owes the Indian government $6.87 billion in license fee, spectrum charges, interest and penalties. The company has already paid $1.07 billion.

Why It Matters: The funding holds importance for the Indian mobile phone company to pay back the government but also to upgrade its network infrastructure, Mint noted.

The move comes as United States technology giants look to be a part of the action in the growing Indian telco industry.

In April, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) picked up a near 10% stake in Asia's richest person Mukesh Ambani's telecom company Jio Platforms for $5.7 billion. In July, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) invested $250 million in the Reliance Industries Ltd. subsidiary. Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) followed with a $4.5 billion funding later that month.

Silver Lake, KKR & Co., QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), L Catterton, TPG Telecom Ltd (NYSE: TSLX), Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are some of the other companies that rushed to invest in Jio this year.

Amazon was also earlier reported to be picking up a 9.9% stake in Jiomart -- Jio's joint e-commerce venture with Reliance Retail.

Price Action: Amazon shares closed nearly 0.9% higher at $3,531.45 on Wednesday. On the same day, Verizon shares closed almost 2.3% higher at $60.53.

527,2020-09-03T06:20:50+00:00,"Amazon, Verizon Look To Join Facebook, Google, Intel In Indian Telco Frenzy With $4B Investment: Report","Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ) are set to resume negotiations to pick up stake in India’s Vodafone Idea Ltd for more than $4 billion, local media reported Thursday.

What Happened: The talks came to a halt as a ruling was expected from the Indian Supreme Court on staggered payments due from the Indian telecom firm, which could have led to an existential crisis for the company, Mint reported.

Vodafone Idea reportedly owes the Indian government $6.87 billion in license fee, spectrum charges, interest and penalties. The company has already paid $1.07 billion.

Why It Matters: The funding holds importance for the Indian mobile phone company to pay back the government but also to upgrade its network infrastructure, Mint noted.

The move comes as United States technology giants look to be a part of the action in the growing Indian telco industry.

In April, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) picked up a near 10% stake in Asia's richest person Mukesh Ambani's telecom company Jio Platforms for $5.7 billion. In July, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) invested $250 million in the Reliance Industries Ltd. subsidiary. Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) followed with a $4.5 billion funding later that month.

Silver Lake, KKR & Co., QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), L Catterton, TPG Telecom Ltd (NYSE: TSLX), Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are some of the other companies that rushed to invest in Jio this year.

Amazon was also earlier reported to be picking up a 9.9% stake in Jiomart -- Jio's joint e-commerce venture with Reliance Retail.

Price Action: Amazon shares closed nearly 0.9% higher at $3,531.45 on Wednesday. On the same day, Verizon shares closed almost 2.3% higher at $60.53.

528,2020-09-02T21:30:00+00:00,"U.S. Tech Bans, Pandemic No Match for Asia’s Electronics Rebound","(Bloomberg) -- The electronics sector has found a way to thrive amid the global pandemic, with 5G demand helping the industry remain a rare catalyst for Asian factories.

South Korean computer sales surged 107% in August and semiconductor shipments grew for a third month in the past four, even as smartphone sales declined and overall exports fell 9.9% from a year earlier, figures out Tuesday showed.

Taiwan’s manufacturing output rose 2.6% in July, while production of computers and integrated circuits climbed by double digits. Shipments of electronics products from Singapore rose in July for a third straight month.

The latest data bolster forecasts that this year’s electronics rebound will persist, even as a U.S. ban on Huawei Technologies Co., further U.S.-China trade tensions and an eventual tapering of demand for work-from-home equipment present obstacles for the industry.

Relentless demand for 5G-related applications, including infrastructure and smartphones, is poised to keep electronics production humming as other output struggles to recover from the pandemic. Even the latest technology bans on Huawei look to be just a stumbling block.

“It’s kind of a little bit of a bump,” Rajan Rajgopal, chief executive officer of Singapore-based DenseLight Semiconductors Pte., said in an Aug. 28 interview.

Two areas of business especially have been booming since before the pandemic: data centers and 5G infrastructure, said Rajgopal, who’s worked in semiconductors for about 25 years. China accounts for about half of DenseLight’s customer base and could take an increasing share as it builds out its next-generation wireless infrastructure across the country -- boosting demand for semiconductors that go into devices as diverse as street cameras and oil-pipeline sensors.

Global semiconductor industry revenue is set to slip by only 0.9% this year to $415.4 billion amid pandemic-related disruptions, according to Gartner Inc. estimates.

Still, significant risk factors are keeping electronics watchers on guard. U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential re-election in November could mean more headaches for Asian supply chains, while it’s unclear how his rival for the White House, former Vice President Joe Biden, would alter U.S. strategy toward China. And retailers across sectors are bracing for a holiday season that could disappoint if government stimulus wears off and labor markets worsen.

Story continues

For now, though, companies expect the electronics boom to overcome the risks -- with Taiwanese firms seeing themselves particularly well-placed to ride out the storm. Industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is charting a “PC resurgence” amid Covid-19, C.C. Tsai, senior director of the company’s Asia-Pacific business, said in a video for a company symposium Aug. 25.

Despite concerns that increased work-from-home orders for things like laptops and webcams would prove temporary, computer demand “continues to remain robust,” and many consumers spending more time at home are also upgrading their television sets, Chairman Fang Leuh of Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., a TSMC affiliate that specializes in power management chips and display driver chips, told reporters Aug. 29.

That matches the read of Quanta Computer Inc., which makes Apple Inc. MacBooks, HP Inc. notebooks and servers for Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google. Elton Yang, chief financial officer of Taiwan-based Quanta, says notebook shipments are expected to grow by double digits in the third quarter.

“Strong orders from our customers confirm shelter-in-place demand is long-term,” Quanta Chairman Barry Lam told reporters Aug. 13. “We will create more products for the shelter-in-place economy to optimize our profitability. This is a big change. We will grab it and gain better opportunities.”

Industry executives acknowledge greater uncertainties around the trade war, U.S. elections and Covid-19, while taking a longer view on the prospects for electronics.

Apple, for example, has asked suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year -- roughly in line with last year’s launch -- a sign that demand for the company’s most important product is holding up despite the pandemic and recession.

Vanguard’s Fang emphasized very strong demand into 2021 for the type of semiconductors his company makes, aided by rollout of 5G technologies. And even if Trump wins another four-year term, complicating DenseLight’s China business, Rajgopal sees a brighter outlook.

“The electronics industry is a lot more resilient than eight years,” he said.

The tech titan –  often referred to as the Chinese version of Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), is the largest e-commerce platform in the country.

What Happened: Alibaba pumped in close to $1 billion to purchase a 12% stake in YTO, bringing its total stake to 22.5%, according to SCMP.

The two companies plan to make a collaborated effort in express deliveries, air cargo, setting up a global logistics network and supply chain, and working on digital technologies.

SCMP reported a similar event when Alibaba’s rival JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) made a $432 million investment in Kuayue Express in mid-August, granting it a controlling stake in the Chinese courier company.

Why It Matters: Reuters reported last week based on unnamed sources that Alibaba was in talks with YTO Express founders to secure an additional 30% stake. At the time, the e-commerce platform held around 10% ownership in the logistics company, which is roughly $0.7 billion.

In 2019, YTO held around 14% market share in China.

Price Action: After a 3.8% uptick during trading hours on Tuesday, Alibaba ADR gained an additional 0.1% in the extended trading hours to close at $298.

Academic research papers are being churned out to explain just how Covid-19 has changed the world of business permanently. Some industries and sectors have fared much better than others during the crisis.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is just one example of a company that’s benefited from Covid-19, with higher e-commerce revenue, greater demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and even growth in digital advertising. Founder Jeff Bezos is now worth almost $200 billion as a result of AMZN stock rising by 80% in the first nine months of 2020.

7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns

Of course, some industries haven’t fared nearly as well. Airlines are one sector unlikely to see any semblance of normalcy for several years.

So which are the best industries to invest in right now? Here are 10 long-term stocks to ride this wave:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) Prologis (NYSE:PLD) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Accor (OTCMKTS:ACCYY) Kinaxis (OTCMKTS:KXSCF) Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teladoc (NASDAQ:TDOC) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)

While these stocks have benefited from coronavirus tailwinds, they were already well-positioned for gains in our increasingly-digitized world. Let’s dive right in.

Amazon isn’t the only e-commerce business to benefit from Covid-19, but it is the biggest.

Stock Twits founder Howard Lindzon recently interviewed Alex Danco on his Panic With Friends podcast. Danco’s take on Amazon says all you need to know about Jeff Bezos and company:

“In order to compete against Amazon, you need to have taste or you need to be ok with losing.”

Story continues

A lot of people probably think they have taste, but Danco’s talking about bankable taste, and that’s much harder to come by. In March 2018, I argued that Amazon wanted to own your home. Not literally, of course, but to be the provider of every product and service found in your house.

And it would do so through its Prime services.

“In Amazon’s case, it increases the number of Prime members and the amount those members spend annually by providing everything you need to run your home and life,” I said back in 2018. “Over time, revenues will exponentially climb, and with it, the price of Amazon stock.”

AMZN stock is up 127% in the two years since. I expect it to continue to move higher as it grabs additional market share across people’s lives. Covid-19 tailwinds have only accelerated this land grab.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office

Intuitive Surgical was a major player in robotics even before Covid-19 hit the world. Now, its surgical systems have become crucial to medical professionals.

Wired published an article in March discussing the difficulties of getting robots into hospitals:

“A cruel irony of the coronavirus pandemic is that medical professionals know better than anyone that social distancing is critical for slowing the rate of new infections, yet they’re forced to be the closest to the disease. And those that need social interaction perhaps more than anybody — the elderly — are the ones who need to isolate the most, since they’re the most susceptible to the disease.”

In this instance, writer Matt Simon is talking about robots providing care to patients in hospitals and the like, but it illustrates why robotics are necessary to the future success of hospitals and other medical facilities.

Intuitive could also partner with iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) to develop a robotic orderly that helps humans do their jobs more effectively while reducing the spread of infectious diseases.

With Intuitive already a big part of hospital life, the acceleration of robotics in healthcare is bound to help ISRG stock continue moving higher.

This segment of the real estate industry was benefiting from e-commerce long before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 has accelerated this trend.

“Accelerated adoption of e-commerce was definitely a positive trend of the pandemic,” said Michael Coppola, a partner with Bluewater Property Group. “E-commerce has changed our industry. We’ll all be attuned to how much of that sticks.”

How good has this positive trend been for owners of industrial real estate? Beyond their wildest expectations.

“The e-commerce increases we’ve seen in the last few months have been astounding,” Duke Realty vice president of leasing and development, Stephanie Rodriguez, said in June. “In this short amount of time, we’re outpacing where we thought we’d be in three years.”

Prologis, the world leader in logistics real estate with 963 million square feet of space in 19 countries, is ideally situated to benefit from this acceleration. Despite the gains it will be seeing from e-commerce, PLD stock is up just 14.6% year to date through August 26.

As far as long-term stocks go, I think investors are undervaluing Prologis’ future potential in 2020. Look for that to change in 2021 and beyond.

With so many people working from home for the foreseeable future, augmented reality (AR) is going to experience an acceleration in demand for products that allow businesses to provide a simulated in-person customer experience.

“[T]he use of AR technology for collaboration and remote support of frontline workers has soared, enabling experts to be much more productive in helping to debug problems and resolve production issues remotely,” U.K. industrial innovation technology specialist Jim Heppelmann told IoTNow in May.

“COVID-19 has meant industry has been forced to adapt quicker than it probably would have done under normal economic circumstances, but now they’ve had a taste of the operational and financial benefits it can deliver, I can see a major rise in adoption.”

In April, InvestorPlace contributor Eric Fry discussed how Covid-19 would accelerate technology changes, and how Nvidia would benefit from those changes.

“To protect your portfolio, you need to have exposure to these nascent trends. And let’s be clear: All roads lead to Nvidia. Thanks to the company’s dominance of the GPU market, it is at the very center of several powerful multi-decade growth waves, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, AI and machine learning,” Fry stated back on April 8.

Accor (ACCYY) A person cooks something in a smoking wok

I would bet my left arm that one of the big companies operating ghost kitchens in the U.S. will merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in the next 12 months. It’s a business that just seems tailor-made for someone with a big name in the restaurant industry to raise half a billion and find such a target.

But this isn’t about SPACs; it’s about ghost kitchens, and ACCYY stock in particular.

At the end of June, The New Yorker discussed why ghost kitchens would be our future. If you don’t know what a ghost kitchen is, it is a restaurant that’s expressly set up for take-out and delivery only — no in-house dining.

The subject of the article was Reef Technology, which is backed by SoftBank Group (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). Reef operates kitchens in 18 cities across the U.S. It also repurposes parking lots into dining spaces. The pandemic has accelerated its plans.

In February, I recommended Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) because of C3, the mall owner’s partnership with SBE Entertainment Group and Accor, to develop 200 ghost kitchens in the U.S. by the end of 2020.

While a lot of restaurants have been laying off people, C3’s been hiring. While you could go with Simon, I like Accor because it owns 50% of SBE Entertainment Group, run by hospitality and real estate entrepreneur Sam Nazarian.

Malls have to do something with all that empty retail space. Why not ghost kitchens?

Kinaxis (KXSCF) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights

Of all the stocks on this list, Kinaxis is most likely the one least familiar to U.S. investors.

Based in Ottawa, Ontario, the company’s RapidResponse cloud-based supply chain management software has garnered a lot of attention, not to mention business, this year due to all of the supply chain issues resulting from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

My wife is in the construction business. You wouldn’t think it would be hard to get ahold of bathtubs right now, but the pandemic has made it difficult for companies across industries to maintain their supply chains.

On August 10, Kinaxis raised its guidance for 2020. Covid-19 had everything to do with that change. In the three months ended June 30, company sales increased by 45% over last year to $61.3 million. In 2020, it expects revenue of at least $216 million, up from guidance of $211 million in the previous quarter.

“Kinaxis has quite simply never been more relevant,” stated CEO John Sicard in a statement. “There has never been more attention on global supply chain resilience and the power of concurrent planning to provide the agility needed to respond to daily disruption.”

7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns

Back in 2018, I discussed how Toyota (NYSE:TM) started using Kinaxis’ software to handle its supply planning instead of doing it by hand. I expect more companies to lean on Kinaxis in the years ahead as supply chain management becomes even more critical than it already is.

Last July, I wrote about seven stocks to invest in that are making life easier for students. One of those picks was Chegg, an online platform that helps individuals become better students by providing tutoring, writing instruction and grammar correction, better study aids, etc.

“Chegg might not be profitable just yet, but it will be. Buy in now while its shares are still affordable,” I wrote on July 16, 2019.

Chegg is up 75% since then.

In the second quarter, Chegg had 3.9 million subscribers for its Chegg Services offering, which includes all of the aforementioned services. For the quarter, subscriber base grew by 29%, while revenue was up 31%. With permanent changes to education expected post-Covid-19, Chegg delivers a winning formula.

It might fall back in the near-term, given how hot it’s been in 2020. However, long-term, I like it a lot. And so does Piper Sandler. which has an overweight rating and a $90 target price on CHGG stock.

The obvious pick when it comes to virtual meetings stocks is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), whose stock was trading below $70 at the start of the year and now is closing in on $300.

While there’s no denying its success, Zoom is a niche specialist. By contrast, Microsoft has several businesses that have benefited from Covid-19 — Teams, Cloud, Gaming and Windows — and should continue to outperform the competition in the months and years ahead.

Now Microsoft is teaming with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to buy TikTok’s U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand businesses. Estimates suggest the duo will have to pay anywhere from $20 to $30 billion for the short-form video application’s business in those countries.

While there are other bidders for TikTok, there’s no doubt that they’ll be looked upon in a positive light by U.S. government regulators.

Teladoc (TDOC) teladoc health logo on a mobile phone screen

Before Covid-19, I’m not sure many people thought telehealth or virtual medicine would become an everyday norm for Americans. Post-Covid, I’m sure many patients will go back to in-person visits with their primary healthcare provider.

On the surface, this suggests that Teladoc’s revenues could be at risk. That said, I’m confident that Teladoc has built this reality into its business model.

Recently, Teladoc announced it would acquire Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) in an all-stock transaction worth $18.5 billion. Teladoc shareholders will own 58% of the merged company and Livongo Health shareholders the rest.

My InvestorPlace colleague Matt McCall recently reminded investors that mergers don’t always work out so well. Matt, you’re preaching to the choir here.

On July 9, I recommended that investors consider Livongo Health’s stock because it would stay hot for years to come:

“With an asset-light business model, I find it hard to believe Livongo’s revenues are going to slow anytime soon. Further, it has more than enough cash to survive the novel coronavirus and anything else Mother Nature chooses to throw at the world. I see LVGO as the diamond-in-the-rough of the seven hot stocks on my list. It’s going to surprise a lot of people in the future.”

Well, 18.5 billion reasons later, the merger gives Teladoc a broader foundation upon which to grow its market-leading telehealth business. Long-term, Teladoc’s a winner.

This last pick probably seems at odds with reality. Covid-19 has decimated small business. And while it might be hard to imagine small businesses rebounding anytime soon, in my experience, these are some of the most resilient entrepreneurs around.

I’m not trying to downplay the facts. According to McKinsey and Co., small businesses were much less prepared for the economic shock of the pandemic, with approximately one-third operating at break-even or even at a loss pre-Covid.

This is where Shopify comes in.

It has the resources and know-how to get businesses rolling again. This technology platform’s reason for being is to help small businesses to be successful. If they win, Shopify wins.

In Canada, the company partnered with the Canadian government to launch Go Digital Canada, expressly set up to help small businesses go digital.

“From our perspective, small businesses, they are the backbone of the Canadian economy. They make up 98 percent of Canadian companies,” Sylvia Ng, general manager of Shopify’s Start product line, told BetaKit in July. “The fact that they’re faced with these unprecedented challenges due to COVID right now [made us want] to provide support to help bring these businesses online, and help future proof that backbone of the Canadian economy.”

Academic research papers are being churned out to explain just how Covid-19 has changed the world of business permanently. Some industries and sectors have fared much better than others during the crisis.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is just one example of a company that’s benefited from Covid-19, with higher e-commerce revenue, greater demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and even growth in digital advertising. Founder Jeff Bezos is now worth almost $200 billion as a result of AMZN stock rising by 80% in the first nine months of 2020.

Of course, some industries haven’t fared nearly as well. Airlines are one sector unlikely to see any semblance of normalcy for several years.

So which are the best industries to invest in right now? Here are 10 long-term stocks to ride this wave:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) Prologis (NYSE:PLD) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Accor (OTCMKTS:ACCYY) Kinaxis (OTCMKTS:KXSCF) Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teladoc (NASDAQ:TDOC) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)

While these stocks have benefited from coronavirus tailwinds, they were already well-positioned for gains in our increasingly-digitized world. Let’s dive right in.

Amazon isn’t the only e-commerce business to benefit from Covid-19, but it is the biggest.

Stock Twits founder Howard Lindzon recently interviewed Alex Danco on his Panic With Friends podcast. Danco’s take on Amazon says all you need to know about Jeff Bezos and company:

“In order to compete against Amazon, you need to have taste or you need to be ok with losing.”

Story continues

A lot of people probably think they have taste, but Danco’s talking about bankable taste, and that’s much harder to come by. In March 2018, I argued that Amazon wanted to own your home. Not literally, of course, but to be the provider of every product and service found in your house.

And it would do so through its Prime services.

“In Amazon’s case, it increases the number of Prime members and the amount those members spend annually by providing everything you need to run your home and life,” I said back in 2018. “Over time, revenues will exponentially climb, and with it, the price of Amazon stock.”

AMZN stock is up 127% in the two years since. I expect it to continue to move higher as it grabs additional market share across people’s lives. Covid-19 tailwinds have only accelerated this land grab.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office

Intuitive Surgical was a major player in robotics even before Covid-19 hit the world. Now, its surgical systems have become crucial to medical professionals.

Wired published an article in March discussing the difficulties of getting robots into hospitals:

“A cruel irony of the coronavirus pandemic is that medical professionals know better than anyone that social distancing is critical for slowing the rate of new infections, yet they’re forced to be the closest to the disease. And those that need social interaction perhaps more than anybody — the elderly — are the ones who need to isolate the most, since they’re the most susceptible to the disease.”

In this instance, writer Matt Simon is talking about robots providing care to patients in hospitals and the like, but it illustrates why robotics are necessary to the future success of hospitals and other medical facilities.

Intuitive could also partner with iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) to develop a robotic orderly that helps humans do their jobs more effectively while reducing the spread of infectious diseases.

With Intuitive already a big part of hospital life, the acceleration of robotics in healthcare is bound to help ISRG stock continue moving higher.

This segment of the real estate industry was benefiting from e-commerce long before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 has accelerated this trend.

“Accelerated adoption of e-commerce was definitely a positive trend of the pandemic,” said Michael Coppola, a partner with Bluewater Property Group. “E-commerce has changed our industry. We’ll all be attuned to how much of that sticks.”

How good has this positive trend been for owners of industrial real estate? Beyond their wildest expectations.

“The e-commerce increases we’ve seen in the last few months have been astounding,” Duke Realty vice president of leasing and development, Stephanie Rodriguez, said in June. “In this short amount of time, we’re outpacing where we thought we’d be in three years.”

Prologis, the world leader in logistics real estate with 963 million square feet of space in 19 countries, is ideally situated to benefit from this acceleration. Despite the gains it will be seeing from e-commerce, PLD stock is up just 14.6% year to date through August 26.

As far as long-term stocks go, I think investors are undervaluing Prologis’ future potential in 2020. Look for that to change in 2021 and beyond.

With so many people working from home for the foreseeable future, augmented reality (AR) is going to experience an acceleration in demand for products that allow businesses to provide a simulated in-person customer experience.

“[T]he use of AR technology for collaboration and remote support of frontline workers has soared, enabling experts to be much more productive in helping to debug problems and resolve production issues remotely,” U.K. industrial innovation technology specialist Jim Heppelmann told IoTNow in May.

“COVID-19 has meant industry has been forced to adapt quicker than it probably would have done under normal economic circumstances, but now they’ve had a taste of the operational and financial benefits it can deliver, I can see a major rise in adoption.”

In April, InvestorPlace contributor Eric Fry discussed how Covid-19 would accelerate technology changes, and how Nvidia would benefit from those changes.

“To protect your portfolio, you need to have exposure to these nascent trends. And let’s be clear: All roads lead to Nvidia. Thanks to the company’s dominance of the GPU market, it is at the very center of several powerful multi-decade growth waves, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, AI and machine learning,” Fry stated back on April 8.

I couldn’t agree more. That’s why I believe NVDA stock is an excellent long-term buy.

Accor (ACCYY) A person cooks something in a smoking wok

I would bet my left arm that one of the big companies operating ghost kitchens in the U.S. will merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in the next 12 months. It’s a business that just seems tailor-made for someone with a big name in the restaurant industry to raise half a billion and find such a target.

But this isn’t about SPACs; it’s about ghost kitchens, and ACCYY stock in particular.

At the end of June, The New Yorker discussed why ghost kitchens would be our future. If you don’t know what a ghost kitchen is, it is a restaurant that’s expressly set up for take-out and delivery only — no in-house dining.

The subject of the article was Reef Technology, which is backed by SoftBank Group (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). Reef operates kitchens in 18 cities across the U.S. It also repurposes parking lots into dining spaces. The pandemic has accelerated its plans.

In February, I recommended Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) because of C3, the mall owner’s partnership with SBE Entertainment Group and Accor, to develop 200 ghost kitchens in the U.S. by the end of 2020.

While a lot of restaurants have been laying off people, C3’s been hiring. While you could go with Simon, I like Accor because it owns 50% of SBE Entertainment Group, run by hospitality and real estate entrepreneur Sam Nazarian.

Malls have to do something with all that empty retail space. Why not ghost kitchens?

Kinaxis (KXSCF) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights

Of all the stocks on this list, Kinaxis is most likely the one least familiar to U.S. investors.

Based in Ottawa, Ontario, the company’s RapidResponse cloud-based supply chain management software has garnered a lot of attention, not to mention business, this year due to all of the supply chain issues resulting from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

My wife is in the construction business. You wouldn’t think it would be hard to get ahold of bathtubs right now, but the pandemic has made it difficult for companies across industries to maintain their supply chains.

On August 10, Kinaxis raised its guidance for 2020. Covid-19 had everything to do with that change. In the three months ended June 30, company sales increased by 45% over last year to $61.3 million. In 2020, it expects revenue of at least $216 million, up from guidance of $211 million in the previous quarter.

“Kinaxis has quite simply never been more relevant,” stated CEO John Sicard in a statement. “There has never been more attention on global supply chain resilience and the power of concurrent planning to provide the agility needed to respond to daily disruption.”

Back in 2018, I discussed how Toyota (NYSE:TM) started using Kinaxis’ software to handle its supply planning instead of doing it by hand. I expect more companies to lean on Kinaxis in the years ahead as supply chain management becomes even more critical than it already is.

Last July, I wrote about seven stocks to invest in that are making life easier for students. One of those picks was Chegg, an online platform that helps individuals become better students by providing tutoring, writing instruction and grammar correction, better study aids, etc.

“Chegg might not be profitable just yet, but it will be. Buy in now while its shares are still affordable,” I wrote on July 16, 2019.

Chegg is up 75% since then.

In the second quarter, Chegg had 3.9 million subscribers for its Chegg Services offering, which includes all of the aforementioned services. For the quarter, subscriber base grew by 29%, while revenue was up 31%. With permanent changes to education expected post-Covid-19, Chegg delivers a winning formula.

It might fall back in the near-term, given how hot it’s been in 2020. However, long-term, I like it a lot. And so does Piper Sandler. which has an overweight rating and a $90 target price on CHGG stock.

The obvious pick when it comes to virtual meetings stocks is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), whose stock was trading below $70 at the start of the year and now is closing in on $300.

While there’s no denying its success, Zoom is a niche specialist. By contrast, Microsoft has several businesses that have benefited from Covid-19 — Teams, Cloud, Gaming and Windows — and should continue to outperform the competition in the months and years ahead.

Now Microsoft is teaming with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to buy TikTok’s U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand businesses. Estimates suggest the duo will have to pay anywhere from $20 to $30 billion for the short-form video application’s business in those countries.

While there are other bidders for TikTok, there’s no doubt that they’ll be looked upon in a positive light by U.S. government regulators.

Before Covid-19, I’m not sure many people thought telehealth or virtual medicine would become an everyday norm for Americans. Post-Covid, I’m sure many patients will go back to in-person visits with their primary healthcare provider.

On the surface, this suggests that Teladoc’s revenues could be at risk. That said, I’m confident that Teladoc has built this reality into its business model.

Recently, Teladoc announced it would acquire Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) in an all-stock transaction worth $18.5 billion. Teladoc shareholders will own 58% of the merged company and Livongo Health shareholders the rest.

My InvestorPlace colleague Matt McCall recently reminded investors that mergers don’t always work out so well. Matt, you’re preaching to the choir here.

On July 9, I recommended that investors consider Livongo Health’s stock because it would stay hot for years to come:

“With an asset-light business model, I find it hard to believe Livongo’s revenues are going to slow anytime soon. Further, it has more than enough cash to survive the novel coronavirus and anything else Mother Nature chooses to throw at the world. I see LVGO as the diamond-in-the-rough of the seven hot stocks on my list. It’s going to surprise a lot of people in the future.”

Well, 18.5 billion reasons later, the merger gives Teladoc a broader foundation upon which to grow its market-leading telehealth business. Long-term, Teladoc’s a winner.

This last pick probably seems at odds with reality. Covid-19 has decimated small business. And while it might be hard to imagine small businesses rebounding anytime soon, in my experience, these are some of the most resilient entrepreneurs around.

I’m not trying to downplay the facts. According to McKinsey and Co., small businesses were much less prepared for the economic shock of the pandemic, with approximately one-third operating at break-even or even at a loss pre-Covid.

This is where Shopify comes in.

It has the resources and know-how to get businesses rolling again. This technology platform’s reason for being is to help small businesses to be successful. If they win, Shopify wins.

In Canada, the company partnered with the Canadian government to launch Go Digital Canada, expressly set up to help small businesses go digital.

534,2020-08-31T22:00:07+00:00,You Think FAANG Is Distorting the S&amp;P? Consider ATM,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have lamented the lack of depth in the U.S. stock market, marveling at how a handful of big tech companies have grown to dominate almost a quarter of the S&P 500 and become responsible for all of this year’s gain. But that lopsidedness is nothing next to China, where the top three stocks in the benchmark MSCI China Index now have more than a 38% weight.

At this rate, instead of buying passive funds that track the MSCI index, investors might as well just pile into China’s version of FAANG, known locally as ATM: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and food delivery super-app Meituan Dianping.

There’s nagging unease that ATM’s economic prospects aren’t as sound as those of Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. In the U.S., deeply entrenched user behavior has protected tech companies from stepping on each other’s toes. Americans shop on Amazon, search on Google, and stream on Netflix.

In China, however, the competitive landscape is a lot murkier. Alibaba continues to face fierce competition from JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. Meanwhile, Jack Ma’s empire is still fighting with Tencent over mobile payments. As for Meituan Dianping, how many century stocks — companies with a market cap north of $100 billion — have rallied more than 160% so far this year? Meituan is eclipsed only by Tesla Inc. So it’s not unnatural to ask how much further ATM can go.

Passive fund flows, unleashed by the super dovish tone of the Federal Reserve, are propelling these three stocks even higher. That makes beating the benchmark MSCI China Index an impossible task. Value investing remains a losing game, because banks, the only segment big enough to tilt the index, are still struggling with bad loan writedowns.

To outperform the index and reduce reliance on ATM, then, investors have no choice but to hunt for smaller growth stocks. JD.com and Pinduoduo, for instance, are hedges against the Alibaba behemoth; both saw their market caps more than double this year. Electric vehicle startups XPeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have launched successful IPOs, as investors increasingly see the industry as recession-proof.

Story continues

Meanwhile, bullish equity analysts are telling tall tales to justify sky-high valuations. In mid-May, Zhongtai Securities Co. published a research report arguing that the baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai Co. is gold-like as an effective hedge against irresponsible central banks printing trillions of dollars of new money. Quantitative easing tends to benefit the rich, and has only created bubbles; as a scarce asset, Moutai is a good buy, the brokerage argued. The liquor maker hit a fresh high Monday, and is now valued at an eye-popping 48 times 2020 earnings.

While it’s understandable that the rich may want to celebrate their stock gains this year with a $300 bottle of Moutai, hot-pot chain operator Haidilao International Holding Ltd.’s meteoric rise is more puzzling. The Chinese are still apprehensive about dining out, recent macro retail data show, and Haidilao posted 965 million yuan ($139.5 million) in losses in the first half, versus 911 million yuan net profit in the same period last year.

But now Haidilao is seen as a robotics play. It opened its first smart, automated restaurant in Beijing almost two years ago. Once artificial intelligence is involved, profitability no longer matters.

There are plenty of other examples. Investors have crowded into expensive after-school education stocks as well as duty-free goods operators, all as attempts to diversify from ATM. When we’re in a bull market, pigs can fly.

For months, we’ve been worried that a top-heavy stock market would be vulnerable to a crash. One generous line of thinking has been that value stocks will perk up once economies recover, and indexes will look more balanced. That may well be the case, but until that day comes — and it could take years — the ATMs and FAANGs of the world have already distorted stock investing into an unrecognizable form.

536,2020-08-31T00:44:52+00:00,Demand for Online Doctors Creates $39 Billion Titan in Japan,"(Bloomberg) -- Two decades ago, Itaru Tanimura ended a 12-year run at McKinsey & Co. to lead M3 Inc., an online provider of medical information and services backed by entertainment giant Sony Corp.

What followed was a flurry of acquisitions that turned the Tokyo-based company into a $39 billion global behemoth. M3 now has about 40 subsidiaries and affiliates, including MDLinx Inc. in the U.S. and Britain’s Doctors.net.uk Ltd.

M3 helps pharmaceutical companies, doctors and their patients access information online over its platforms, removing the need for in-person visits -- something that proved important in the time of Covid-19. Its shares have almost doubled this year, surging the most of any company in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average and taking the fortune of Tanimura to $1.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“Online doctor capabilities are in the spotlight with Covid, as people are staying home,” Jefferies Japan Ltd. analyst Hiroko Sato said in an interview. “It’s really a theme stock.”

Inquiries Skyrocket

The shares climbed 1.2% by 9:44 a.m. in Tokyo Monday.

A rush by smaller pharma companies to digitalize marketing materials after the coronavirus outbreak helped boost sales, with inquiries skyrocketing. M3’s operating profit climbed 26% in the quarter ended in June, beating the highest analyst estimate.

The company’s name stands for “the three Ms of Medicine, Media and Metamorphosis,” and its goal is to change medicine by “making full use of the power of the Internet,” according to its website.

Its acquisition spree started in 2002, when M3 bought the Japanese unit of U.S. medical portal site WebMD. MDLinx was acquired in 2006 and Doctors.net.uk in 2011. M3, which gets about three-quarters of its revenue from Japan, also has units in China, India and France. One of its U.S. subsidiaries was selected to take part in Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine study.

Tanimura, 55, is president and holds a 2.9% stake in M3. Sony owns about a third of the company. M3 declined to comment for this story, while Sony didn’t respond to phone calls and an email seeking comment.

Story continues

Tech Wealth

The pandemic has produced vast wealth gains among both tech and pharma titans. Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos has amassed more than anyone else, with his fortune hitting $200 billion, while Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma and Jiang Rensheng, the chairman of vaccine maker Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., have added more than $11 billion each.

While M3 said in its earnings report that Covid-19 disrupted some of its business, it always has Sony to lean on. The entertainment giant unveiled a $100 million relief fund to help tackle the outbreak in April and funneled some of that cash toward M3.

“Sony and M3 will be able to bring unprecedented ideas to the medical community,” Tanimura said at the time. “Our first priority will be the rapid development of contributive measures to the fight against Covid-19.”

537,2020-08-31T00:44:52+00:00,Demand for Online Doctors Creates $39 Billion Titan in Japan,"(Bloomberg) -- Two decades ago, Itaru Tanimura ended a 12-year run at McKinsey & Co. to lead M3 Inc., an online provider of medical information and services backed by entertainment giant Sony Corp.

What followed was a flurry of acquisitions that turned the Tokyo-based company into a $39 billion global behemoth. M3 now has about 40 subsidiaries and affiliates, including MDLinx Inc. in the U.S. and Britain’s Doctors.net.uk Ltd.

M3 helps pharmaceutical companies, doctors and their patients access information online over its platforms, removing the need for in-person visits -- something that proved important in the time of Covid-19. Its shares have almost doubled this year, surging the most of any company in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average and taking the fortune of Tanimura to $1.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“Online doctor capabilities are in the spotlight with Covid, as people are staying home,” Jefferies Japan Ltd. analyst Hiroko Sato said in an interview. “It’s really a theme stock.”

Inquiries Skyrocket

The shares climbed 1.2% by 9:44 a.m. in Tokyo Monday.

A rush by smaller pharma companies to digitalize marketing materials after the coronavirus outbreak helped boost sales, with inquiries skyrocketing. M3’s operating profit climbed 26% in the quarter ended in June, beating the highest analyst estimate.

The company’s name stands for “the three Ms of Medicine, Media and Metamorphosis,” and its goal is to change medicine by “making full use of the power of the Internet,” according to its website.

Its acquisition spree started in 2002, when M3 bought the Japanese unit of U.S. medical portal site WebMD. MDLinx was acquired in 2006 and Doctors.net.uk in 2011. M3, which gets about three-quarters of its revenue from Japan, also has units in China, India and France. One of its U.S. subsidiaries was selected to take part in Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine study.

Tanimura, 55, is president and holds a 2.9% stake in M3. Sony owns about a third of the company. M3 declined to comment for this story, while Sony didn’t respond to phone calls and an email seeking comment.

Story continues

Tech Wealth

The pandemic has produced vast wealth gains among both tech and pharma titans. Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos has amassed more than anyone else, with his fortune hitting $200 billion, while Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma and Jiang Rensheng, the chairman of vaccine maker Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., have added more than $11 billion each.

While M3 said in its earnings report that Covid-19 disrupted some of its business, it always has Sony to lean on. The entertainment giant unveiled a $100 million relief fund to help tackle the outbreak in April and funneled some of that cash toward M3.

“Sony and M3 will be able to bring unprecedented ideas to the medical community,” Tanimura said at the time. “Our first priority will be the rapid development of contributive measures to the fight against Covid-19.”

538,2020-08-28T15:02:10+00:00,UK supermarket Waitrose partners Deliveroo for 30-minute delivery,"LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - British supermarket Waitrose is teaming up with Deliveroo to trial fast home-delivery as its long partnership with online grocery specialist Ocado comes to an end.

The supermarket, part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, said Deliveroo customers would be able to order more than 500 food and drink products for delivery in as little as 30 minutes in the period between one hour after stores open and one hour before they close.

The service, which will complement the supermarket's own two-hour and full-service deliveries, will be available to over half a million households in a 12-week trial, Waitrose said on Friday.

Waitrose Executive Director James Bailey said the Deliveroo partnership was ""another opportunity to give our customers a taste of what the future of convenience shopping could look like for us"".

Deliveroo, which is backed by Amazon.com, is a leading player in restaurant food-ordering and delivery, and its cycle couriers are a common sight on UK streets.

It already offers 30-minute grocery deliveries from supermarket group Coop and it has started trials with Aldi UK.

Waitrose is a long-standing supplier to Ocado, an online supermarket that has benefited from a surge in demand for home delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

That deal, however, comes to an end next week when its rival Marks & Spencer starts supplying Ocado shoppers with around 6,500 of its products.

539,2020-08-28T13:37:59+00:00,7 Top Stocks Under $5,"Penny stocks often get a bad rap for their low trading price, but many investors will tell you that they are actually some of the top stocks to buy. Although companies that trade at a low price range are often a victim of bad business decisions, the affordability of these stocks makes them an appealing buy for investing newbies.

The uncertainty of the pandemic has shed light on the importance of earning a passive income. Investing in the stock market has long been proven to be one of the best ways to do this. This increased awareness has resulted in a surge in the number of young retail traders who are looking to dip their toes into the markets, often with very little capital.

While penny stocks have their fair share of bad eggs, some companies that are trading under $5 do show some solid growth prospects. With a good amount of research and some luck, there are some excellent gains to be made with penny stocks. Here are seven tops stocks to buy:

30 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for 20 Years of Income Growth

Genius Brands (NASDAQ:GNUS) OrganiGram Holdings (NASDAQ:OGI) Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH) Synlogic (NASDAQ:SYBX) Charlotte’s Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) Storage Vault Canada (TSXV:SVI) XpressSpa Group (NASDAQ:XSPA)

As schools remain shut for the foreseeable future, Genius Brands, the kid’s on-demand video entertainment company, has had a good summer. The brand operates a range of channels that are broadcast to over 100 million households in the U.S.

This summer, the company launched the Kartoon Channel, a free video-platform for kids that earns its revenue through ads. Investors reacted well to the launch of the new channel and the stock price rose to $8 for a while before it fell back to $1.14.

Although the viability of Genius Brands stock remains widely speculative, the brand’s high-profile deals with major companies makes this stock worth your time. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have signed on to sell toys from one of the company’s TV shows. Stan Lee’s Universe has also finalized an agreement with the channel to create original content for over 100 characters.

Story continues

On the downside, the company has found itself in the midst of multiple class-action lawsuits that have hurt the stock price. Revenue numbers also remain low and the company is not yet profitable.

Nevertheless, investors believe in the fundamentals of the company and its ability to emerge as a winner despite its problems. As one of the most widely-owned stocks on Robinhood, Genius Brands is one of our top stocks to buy.

OrganiGram was widely regarded as one of the best cannabis stocks on the market, but the pandemic put a wrench in its plans for expansion and growth. The company was forced to lay off 25% of its workforce and decrease production levels at the Canadian plant.

OrganiGram also released its earnings for the second quarter and the numbers were not impressive. With negative EBITDA and zero growth, the company sustained massive losses for the period. However, investors continue to remain bullish on the stock.

7 Renewable Energy Stocks for a Cleaner Future

The cannabis company has outlined its plans for expansion in the coming months to improve its position in the industry. OrganiGram has also introduced a line of new products like marijuana pods that will be launched in its Canadian market. This has led many investors to believe that the company could emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. Given its future growth prospects, OrganiGram remains one of the top stocks to buy while prices remain low.

Waitr Holdings (WTRH) Photo of Waitr (WTRH) logo in a mobile app store browser.

As the lockdown economy continues, Waitr Holdings, a food delivery company, is well-positioned to benefit from the current environment. The company’s stock price rallied from 35 cents per share at the start of the year to $4.57 as of this writing. That’s an impressive 1,200% increase.

Unlike GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER), which seek to capture the mass market, Waitr Holdings targets smaller cities like Louisiana and Virginia. The company’s strong position in these regions shows a lot of promise for future growth.

In its most recent quarter, Waitr also reported some impressive earnings with a net increase in revenue to $60 million and a net income of $8 million. Waitr’s stock has shown a strong uptrend over the past year and experts believe this is likely to continue. This is definitely one of the top stocks to buy in today’s investing environment.

Synlogic (SYBX) floating molecules representing biotech stocks like SRNE stock

With the development of a Covid-19 vaccine underway, biotech stocks have become a hot commodity for many investors. Synlogic, a big player in this space, has developed a therapeutic program designed to treat diseases in innovative ways. While the company is still smaller than rivals like Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), the stock’s price point makes it an attractive investment.

Priced at just $2.31 per share, Synlogic is the perfect beginner stock for investors who are looking to make some plays in the biotech space. The company is currently in phase 2 of its clinical trials for a synthetic biotic medicine that will be used orally to treat patients with novel diseases.

9 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills

In addition to this, the company also has a number of new clinical trials that will be initiated in 2021. Raghuram Selvaraju, an analyst at H.C Wainwright, is confident that the company’s stock price will soar by 504% in the next year, given the success of its current trials. If you are looking for affordable investments with a strong return, Synlogic is one of the top stocks to buy in the biotech space.

Charlotte’s Web (CWBHF) Image of a Charlotte's Web (CWBHF) branded hemp product

Another cannabis penny stock that remains a strong buy is Charlotte’s Web. In contrast to traditional cannabis brands, the company places a strong emphasis on the ingredient hemp. Hemp products are federally legal and can cross most U.S state borders. This legality gives Charlotte’s Web access to a wider market.

An added reason for rising investor confidence in the brand is its strong D2C business. In the first quarter of 2020, online sales made up 66% of total revenue. Analysts believe this number will increase when the company reports its quarterly earnings on Sept. 14.

Furthermore, the U.S Food and Drug Administration is in talks about a new enforcement policy for the sale of marijuana. Depending on the consensus, Charlotte’s Web may have the opportunity to sell more CBD products in the future. With high analyst expectations for the upcoming earnings report, this is one of the top stocks to buy in the cannabis industry.

Storage Vault Canada (SVI) image of storage containers to represent top stocks to buy

Another penny stock that’s poised for growth is Storage Vault. The Canadian company operates a self-storage business with over 150 stores and 4,600 units across the country.

Although storage units don’t seem like a hot commodity like tech or biotech, the need for storage space is now greater than ever. With a rent crisis looming over large cities like New York and San Francisco, residents are now looking to either move to other states or downsize their homes. This could create a greater demand for storage units.

While many businesses found themselves near the brink of collapse in the corona-economy, Storage Vault recorded a 9% increase in sales during the month of June and a 3% increase in revenue. As the pandemic continues to take its toll on the economy, storage units are likely to be in demand well into the future.

10 Growth Stocks That Could Seriously Double

The Canadian storage industry is also estimated to be worth over $90 million and Storage Vault’s strong position in the market will help the company drive its top-line growth. This is one of the top stocks to buy this year.

XpressSpa operated an on-demand health and wellness service in airports but was quick to pivot its business model to provide Covid-19 testing. When the company announced its new business model, investors reacted well to the news and its stock price jumped from 15 cents to $8.82 in June, but fell back to $2.72 since then.

After initiating the service at the airport, the company planned to cut the testing time from 48 hours to just under 15 minutes. They did this by inking an agreement with Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to obtain 100 ID NOW testing instruments which would enable them to expedite the testing period. The company’s stock price jumped 18% higher after the deal was announced.

XpressSpa’s Covid-19 testing service is a testament to the company’s ability to stay relevant despite the volatile economy. The company plans to expand its service and convert more spa locations at airports to testing centers. Given the growth prospects of this penny stock, XpressSpa Group is definitely one of the top stocks to buy in the current environment.

540,2020-08-27T14:00:00+00:00,Cerner Teams With Amazon to Help Consumers Improve Their Health and Wellness,"Integration Empowers Consumers to Measure and Share Important Data With Health Care Teams

Sharp Healthcare First Health System to Implement Halo

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug.  27, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cerner Corporation (Nasdaq: CERN), a global health care technology company, announced today a new collaboration with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) that allows consumers to easily connect vital health and well-being information with their broader health care teams. The Amazon Halo, a new service dedicated to helping customers improve health and wellness, can connect to Cerner’s technology where individuals can opt-in to share activity, sleep, body fat percentage and other important wellness data from the comfort of their home. Historically this type of data has been siloed or difficult to obtain. Wearable technology, such as the Amazon Halo, can help achieve greater interoperability across health care when integrated directly into a patient’s electronic health record (EHR). Longtime Cerner client Sharp HealthCare is the first health system to implement Amazon Halo in the health care setting.

In recent years, a growing number of consumers have become more empowered and engaged in their own health care journeys, in many cases seeking out opportunities to employ technology and data-sharing to support healthier decisions. Much of this shift has been driven by the rapidly growing number of connected wearable devices. By introducing valuable data from Amazon Halo into the Cerner EHR and well-being offerings, consumers and care teams alike can now have a more accurate and timely view of an individual’s health.

“The health care industry is undergoing a digital revolution, where physicians are increasingly looking to leverage patient-generated health data to help keep them healthier and out of the doctor’s office,” said David Bradshaw, senior vice president of consumer and employer solutions, Cerner. “Our work with Amazon Halo highlights the importance of using artificial intelligence and other leading-edge technologies to accelerate health care innovation and improve health outcomes. Cerner is focused on continuing to lead a wave of breakthrough innovation, and this integration with Amazon Halo is a step toward this goal. We’re excited that our client, Sharp HealthCare, is the first health system to be able to take advantage of the Amazon Halo integration.”

Amazon Halo uses new innovations in computer vision to let members get a highly accurate measure of their body fat percentage, from the comfort and privacy of their own home. Participating clients can allow Amazon Halo members to opt-in to a more comprehensive view of their wellness data, including sleep and activity, shared directly to Cerner Consumer Well-being technology, hosted in the secure and resilient Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.  Through Cerner’s Consumer Well-being offers and related Workforce Health services, companies who purchase Amazon Halo Bands can offer their employees and health plan members this connectivity as part of their wellness programs or as part of a bring-your-own-device model.

In addition, patients can also share body fat percentage with their clinical care team by connecting their Cerner HealtheLifeSM application. This data can show progress on an individual’s goals, inform care team guidance and offer a more comprehensive view of activities that, when managed proactively, can positively influence a person’s overall health.

“As a leader in health care technology, Cerner shares our deep commitment to helping customers improve their individual health and wellness. We look forward to seeing the benefits Cerner Consumer Well-being clients can offer their customers with Amazon Halo for making healthy choices,” said Melissa Cha, vice president, Amazon Halo. “Additionally, Amazon Halo members will be able to share their body fat percentage—a better measure of overall health than just weight or BMI alone—with their care providers using the Cerner EHR, so care teams will have more relevant, useful information to consider in enabling better health outcomes.”

The first health system to implement the Amazon Halo integration is Cerner client Sharp HealthCare, a leading health care provider located in San Diego with 2,600 physicians across four acute care and three specialty hospitals. The Amazon Halo Band will initially be provided to a limited number of Sharp Health Plan members participating in wellness programs to aid in self-directed and coach-guided lifestyle behavior changes. Last year, Sharp HealthCare expanded its longstanding relationship with Cerner adding EHR and revenue cycle support to its more than 200 primary care and specialty clinics across its outpatient facilities and independent physician practice groups. In further alignment as the relationship progresses, Sharp HealthCare patients who receive the band will eventually have the option to link their Sharp and Halo accounts to the Cerner EHR to share their body fat percentage with the clinical care team.

“Technology is revolutionizing the way we care for patients and how consumers care for themselves, and, at Sharp, we strive to embrace innovative ways to leverage leading technology to engage consumers in managing their health,” said Michael Reagin, chief information and innovation officer, Sharp HealthCare. “With more relevant information at their fingertips, our populations will be empowered to make more informed decisions about the health and well-being of themselves and the communities they serve. We are pleased to work with Cerner and Amazon Halo to offer our members, patients and clinicians an opportunity to have a more connected health record.”

This collaboration follows the Cerner and AWS announcement a year ago to accelerate health care innovation, enhance clinical experiences, increase efficiencies, lower operational burdens for health care and accelerate artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance better patient health outcomes. Today’s announcement provides consumers and their health care teams with previously hard to obtain health metrics that help consumers focus more on making personalized and actionable behavior changes to help lead to longer-term improved health.

The Amazon Halo is available in the U.S. for early access, click here to request early access.

541,2020-08-25T22:00:11+00:00,FANGMAN Is No Match for These 'Seven Princesses',"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have marveled at how the U.S. stock market has become dominated by Big Tech. Just a handful of companies — captured by acronyms such as FANG, FAANG and even FANGMAN — have emerged as winners in the Covid-19 world.

This is by no means a phenomenon unique to the U.S. In South Korea, investors have crowded into what’s known locally as the seven princesses: two biotechs, two electric-vehicle battery makers and three internet companies. On average, they have rallied about 90% this year, outperforming FAANG stocks (Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent, Alphabet Inc.). Together, the princesses account for more than 18% of the Kospi Index, promising to overtake the ultimate blue chip, Samsung Electronics Co. as the dominant market mover.

South Korean equities have weathered a seismic shift this year. Retail investors, who dabbled in cryptocurrencies and all sorts of exotic structured products in the past, are now buying domestic stocks. They single-handedly supported the main stock index as foreigners fled.

But unlike investors from abroad, who see the Kospi as a mere cyclical semiconductor play, locals are hunting for the next Samsung, one that will thrive in a society rewritten by trade wars and Covid-19. In their view, the smartphone supply chain is yesterday’s story. U.S. President Donald Trump was unraveling it well before the coronavirus outbreak.

Instead, the Koreans are beaming with national pride at the sophistication of their advanced medical supplies and technology, and the country’s success in controlling the pandemic. Two of the princesses, Samsung Biologics Co. and Celltrion Inc., play right into that sentiment.

Just as its sibling Samsung Electronics makes memory chips for Apple’s iPhone, Samsung Biologics seeks to leverage the conglomerate’s manufacturing prowess to make drugs and vaccines for Big Pharma. Earlier this month, the company laid out an ambitious plan to build a fourth plant, its largest by far, boosting its total capacity 71% and turning it into the world’s largest biopharmaceutical manufacturer. Meanwhile, Celltrion is introducing two coronavirus testing kits in the U.S.; last month, its Covid-19 antibody drug entered phase one clinical trials.

Story continues

EV battery manufacturing is another sector many Koreans see as Covid-proof (just look at Tesla Inc.’s stock). It’s also an area where the country already has an edge, given Samsung SDI Co. and LG Chem Ltd. are global leaders. The battery makers can see rising demand ahead. China has extended its EV subsidies until 2022 to support the industry, while the European Union has earmarked 30% of its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion), seven-year budget for climate-related spending.

And don’t forget, Korea has state-of-the-art internet infrastructure, which enables e-commerce and video gaming when people are stuck at home. Unlike traditional retail sales, Korea’s lockdown didn’t even make a dent in e-commerce. Online shopping has bigger penetration than in the U.S., accounting for about 30% of the total retail value versus 20%. This benefits Naver Corp., Kakao Corp. and video-game developer NCSoft Corp., the three internet princesses.

On a traditional price-to-earnings basis, none of the seven princesses is coming cheap. But what’s valuation in the world of easy money? As the Bank of Korea pushes its benchmark rate to near zero, future earnings — as far as a decade down the road — don’t need to be discounted.

You could even go a step further and argue the princesses are a more diversified bunch than FANGMAN, which all orbit around smartphones. The Koreans know better than to pin their hopes on one prince charming.

It’s also an area where the country already has an edge, given Samsung SDI Co. and LG Chem Ltd. are global leaders. The battery makers can see rising demand ahead. China has extended its EV subsidies until 2022 to support the industry, while the European Union has earmarked 30% of its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion), seven-year budget for climate-related spending.

And don’t forget, Korea has state-of-the-art internet infrastructure, which enables e-commerce and video gaming when people are stuck at home. Unlike traditional retail sales, Korea’s lockdown didn’t even make a dent in e-commerce. Online shopping has bigger penetration than in the U.S., accounting for about 30% of the total retail value versus 20%. This benefits Naver Corp., Kakao Corp. and video-game developer NCSoft Corp., the three internet princesses.

On a traditional price-to-earnings basis, none of the seven princesses is coming cheap. But what’s valuation in the world of easy money? As the Bank of Korea pushes its benchmark rate to near zero, future earnings — as far as a decade down the road — don’t need to be discounted.

You could even go a step further and argue the princesses are a more diversified bunch than FANGMAN, which all orbit around smartphones. The Koreans know better than to pin their hopes on one prince charming.

543,2020-08-25T03:49:44+00:00,India’s New Economy Can’t Be a Monopoly Board,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Two years ago, India rolled out a laudable plan to unlock the capital trapped in some of its smaller airports. But the actual outcome from privatization was less than reassuring: All six airfields put on the block went to one bidder.

If that wasn’t enough, multiple media reports now say that Ahmedabad, Gujarat-based billionaire Gautam Adani, an early and enthusiastic supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, might also succeed in taking control of the already-privatized Mumbai airport, as well as a new one coming up on the financial center’s outskirts.

Airports are natural monopolies. To have one private owner controlling eight or more — a fresh batch of six will soon go under the hammer — can’t possibly be great news for airlines, fliers, or businesses operating from the premises.

More worryingly, the concentration of economic power in aviation infrastructure is now symptomatic of a broader trend in India, particularly in businesses where the government supplies a key ingredient, such as telecom spectrum.

The splashy 2016 entry of tycoon Mukesh Ambani in 4G mobile was a huge boon. The richest Indian single-handedly crushed data charges for customers to 9 cents a gigabyte, the lowest in the world. But a field that once boasted a dozen players is now effectively a duopoly. The fate of a third service will be decided by a court order about how much time Vodafone Idea Ltd. has to pay its share of the $19 billion demanded by the government from telecom firms as past dues.

If Ambani’s vision of a carriage, content and commerce triple play is sexy enough to attract investment from the likes of Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Adani’s ambition of owning ports, airports, railway tracks, power plants and energy distribution utilities, is humdrum but lucrative.

The worry is that dominance by a handful of capitalists may not leave enough space for others. But then, who’s even ready or willing to compete, especially in sectors where state policy has a big role in determining winners? Barring some notable exceptions, the Indian business class is overextended, trapped in the debris of assets created with the help of syndicated loans from pliant state-run banks. Politicians even have a name for it: phone banking, where they make the calls and tell bankers to whom to give loans.

It’s impossible to carry on this way. After the Covid-19 disruption, government-owned Indian banks will require as much as $28 billion in external capital over two years to raise their loss provisions on bad loans to 70% and double credit growth from last fiscal year’s abysmal 4%, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Much of this money will have to come from a government that can’t keep a lid on its borrowing costs. A sharp, private credit-fueled recovery for the economy appears to be out of the question.

That’s probably why policy makers are resigned to letting whoever has any financing muscles take what they can. There are antitrust laws, but they’re being used to investigate discounting practices of Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.-owned Flipkart, even though their share of overall retail is minuscule. Tax laws have been used to hound startups.

Courts, which can enforce fair and stable relations between the state and business, are adding to the confusion by asking if banks have a claim on airwaves — a sovereign asset — held by insolvent telcos. Who’ll lend for 5G networks when such basic issues in creditor rights are undecided?

To top it all, the pandemic and badly soured relations with China provide ample cover for an isolationist campaign of economic self-reliance, which can be used by tycoons to charge local customers more. Adani won the bids for six airports fair and square, but then used Covid-19 to negotiate for extra time to take over three of them. However, when it came to winning the Mumbai terminal from GVK Power & Infrastructure Ltd., its liquidity-strapped current owner, disruption to travel doesn’t seem to have damped the group’s eagerness. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and PSP Investments, a Canadian pension fund, were separately talking to GVK about a deal. They have written letters to the Indian government, asking for a transparent transaction, the Economic Times has reported.

India’s 2016 adoption of a modern bankruptcy law raised hopes that global capital would have an equal chance to take productive assets out of weak hands. The expectation was that the government would follow the Australian asset-recycling model to pay for $1 trillion worth of new infrastructure. But with insolvency courts temporarily shut to new cases, and so many airports going to one buyer, it’s unclear if foreigners’ ardor will endure. After the coronavirus, there’s no dearth of distressed assets globally.

Just as opening up the economy in the 1990s was a windfall for the current generation of middle-class Indians, excessive economic concentration will be a headache for the next. Like in South Korea, people may one day realize how a few conglomerates are sapping the entrepreneurial energy of everyone else. By then, it will be too late, and the country might be burdened with the equivalent of a “chaebol discount.” Laying the foundations of a competitive economy is still possible. But if India can’t ensure that with state assets, the corporate landscape will start looking like a Monopoly board, to its aspiring oligarchs and the rest of the world.

545,2020-08-24T16:00:10+00:00,There's More Than One Way to Deliver the Mail,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is testifying before Congress to defend his management of the Postal Service amid concern over voting by mail and the integrity of the November election. Democrats have questioned whether recent slowdowns and cutbacks at the post office under DeJoy may be part of an effort to suppress voting orchestrated by President Donald Trump, according to Bloomberg News. DeJoy told a Senate committee that allegations that cutbacks at the post office are aimed at having an impact on the November election are an “outrageous claim.” DeJoy said he’s simply trying run the Postal Service, which loses money, more efficiently and like a business.

Bloomberg Opinion figured it would be a good time to see how mail delivery works in other parts of the world, and whether the types of issues that are in focus in the U.S. exist elsewhere. Here are the results:

Germany's Publicly-Traded Post Office

Germany will mark the 20-year anniversary of its postal service becoming a publicly traded company in November. Today, Deutsche Post AG boasts a 47 billion euro ($56 billion) market capitalization, is nicely profitable, employs more than half a million people and is held in generally high esteem by the public. The shrinking German letters business accounts for just 15% of its 63 billion euros total revenues; services such as express delivery, freight forwarding and e-commerce make up the rest.

Yet for all its profits and solid management, Deutsche Post is hardly the corporate embodiment of Ayn Rand. It’s still obliged to deliver domestic mail six days a week, the unionized German workforce sometimes goes on strike and the state still owns one-fifth of the shares via the KFW development bank. Retaining the state as an anchor shareholder has boosted Deutsche Post’s credit standing, allowing it to borrow cheaply. Before becoming a public company, it also transferred a big chunk of civil servant pension liabilities to the government, lightening a burden that weighs heavy on the U.S. Postal Service.

Story continues

While there are occasional gripes about service quality and rising postage costs, Deutsche Post is a regulated entity and no longer much of a political football. Public aversion to post office closures was overcome by allowing independent retail stores to operate small postal franchises, which are open longer. Customers can also collect internet shopping from unstaffed parcel machines and buy stamps online. And voting by mail has steadily risen to almost 30% of votes cast in the German federal election, and is uncontroversial. — Chris Bryant

The U.K.’s Royal Mail: Essential Yet Struggling

At the peak of the pandemic in April, a British postman managed to deliver a parcel labelled “vital survival stuff” whose address was simply “somewhere in Sheffield.” The postman located the addressee through Facebook and delivered the package of chocolate bars from a sender in Sweden.

Apart from that, things have been pretty grim at Royal Mail, Britain’s privatized mail service, which is struggling to modernize in the face of labor opposition. It has recently faced job cuts and restructurings, threats of strike action, walkouts over poor safety measures (four postal workers have died from Covid-19) and a 1.5 million pound ($1.96 million) fine for tardy delivery of first-class mail and overcharging customers for stamps.

Royal Mail has a universal service obligation, and is required to make deliveries six times a week around the country, so it is limited on the cost-cutting side. Somewhat confusingly, it was separated in 2012 from the state-controlled Post Office, which runs the network of over 11,600 branches that provide handles postal as well as government and financial services. Post Office branches are largely run by franchise partners and independent retailers, often known as subpostmasters, who are paid a fixed fee or commission. The number of branches has halved over the years, but 99% of the U.K. population must still be within three miles, and 90% within one mile, of an outlet. And yet it too has had to grapple with changing demand in the the digital age, a shrinking revenue base and court battles with stakeholders.

Whatever their respective struggles, Brits seem attached to both services, for different reasons. The decline of old-fashioned mail and the rise of Amazon.com have not shaken belief that a universal service obligation for mailed communications, symbolized by those iconic red pillar boxes that have been around since 1852, is part of the social contract. More than 18% of ballots cast in the 2019 general election were postal ballots.

As for the Post Office, for all the concerns about branch closures and declining profits, it made an operating profit of 40 million pounds in 2019. A 2016 study put the social value of the Post Office — what people were willing to pay for its services — at between 4.3 billion pounds and 9.7 billion pounds. — Therese Raphael

Japan’s Post Office Is Bigger Than Citigroup

What’s Japan’s largest financial company after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.? By some measures, it’s the country’s postal service, Japan Post Holdings Co., with an asset base larger than those of Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.

Postal savings banks have been around almost as long as state postal services, and Japan’s has long been a behemoth. Since the late 19th century, much of its wealth was built upon deposits taken in the country’s post offices and reinvested in nation-building infrastructure. Thanks to income from Japan Post’s separately-listed banking and insurance arms, the parent company is forecast to make 280 billion yen ($2.65 billion) of net income this year despite its core postal business not earning a cent.

To be sure, life as a Japanese bank in the 21st century isn’t all that more lucrative than existence as a postal service — especially when, as has historically been the case, you’re obliged to invest in negative-yielding Japanese government debt. The parent company and Japan Post Bank Ltd. have each lost almost half their equity value since a 2015 initial public share offering. Still, analysts expect the group as a whole to make stable profits well into the current decade, and retail investors continue to sock their money away. The 4.48 trillion yen increase in deposits in the June quarter was the biggest in records dating back to 2014. There are worse ways of keeping a public service in operation without draining the public purse. — David Fickling

Australia Post Is Looking to Pivot

The coronavirus pandemic has underscored the ways that Australia Post has been torn in two directions in recent years. For years, the balancing act pursued by its managers has been around minimizing costs from its loss-making letter delivery arm while maximizing its profits from parcels, where its dominant position has helped it prosper from growing volumes of online shopping.

Letter volumes have fallen by more than half since 2008, and one of the first moves AusPost made was to switch to deliveries only every second day, rather than daily — a temporary measure that few would be surprised to see become permanent. At the same time, parcel volumes were up around 50% or more on usual levels at the peak of the lockdown, and the company is looking to increase the frequency of deliveries to handle the flood.

Growing numbers of parcels will lift revenues, but they may cause margins to narrow, too. AusPost has had to pay third parties to make deliveries because it doesn’t have enough staff to handle the surge. Its fleet of delivery motor scooters looks increasingly obsolete, too, in an era when vans are needed to cope with growing volumes of bulky packages.

After a flurry of interest in privatization earlier this decade, that talk has long since died down. The more likely outcome would be less frequent, costlier letter deliveries so that core business is finally able to stand on its own feet. — David Fickling

The companies are discussing an offer price range of HK$3.30 to HK$3.40 for each Leyou share, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Leyou’s major shareholder Charles Yuk plans to sell his entire stake in the company, the people said. Yuk held about 69% of the Hong Kong-listed firm as of the end of December, its latest annual report shows.

Shares of Leyou erased earlier losses and jumped as much as 4.8% on the Bloomberg News report. The stock closed up 2.9% at HK$3.20, giving the gaming company a market value of about $1.27 billion.

Negotiations are in an advanced stage and an agreement could be announced as soon as this week, according to the people. Talks could still be delayed or fall apart and details including offer price and timeline have not been finalized, the people said. Representatives for Leyou and Tencent didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

A deal would mark the end of almost a yearlong process that has been in motion since at least September. Bidders included Tencent-backed iDreamSky Technology Holdings Ltd., Zhejiang Century Huatong Group Co., a Shenzhen-listed gaming firm that also counts Tencent as a shareholder, Japanese tech giant Sony Corp., as well as private equity firms.

On July 10, Tencent Mobility Ltd., a wholly-owned unit of the Chinese tech giant, entered into an exclusive agreement with Leyou for a potential privatization. The companies didn’t provide any financial details.

Leyou, which was listed in Hong Kong in 2011, makes games including free shooting games Warframe and Dirty Bomb. It’s also working with Amazon.com Inc. to co-produce a video game based on the popular fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings,” according to its website.

Story continues

The company reported a $5.8 million loss in the first half of the year, compared to $9.3 million net income in the same period in 2019. Leyou attributed the loss in part to the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on the ability to develop fresh content for Warframe, even though registered users rose 15.5% in the half-year period compared to the previous year.

549,2020-08-21T17:42:52+00:00,7 Index Funds To Buy For A Firm Portfolio Foundation,"An index typically tracks returns on a buy-and-hold basis and therefore constitutes a passive investment approach. An index fund, also known as exchange-traded fund (ETF), is a basket of securities — some combination of stocks, bonds and commodities. Many of these funds track various indices and help investors diversify their portfolio holdings.

Over the past three decades, index funds have become some of the most popular passive investment vehicles among retail and professional investors. Low transaction costs and intraday liquidity are among the biggest benefits for investors. And even in these uncertain times, new investors are wading into the stock market.

6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now

Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach, spoke with InvestorPlace via email to offer some advice to new investors. She says:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

“Beginning investors need to keep in mind that the opportunity to enter the financial markets is based on institutional and regulatory protections, as well as the need to time the entry. The goal is to buy low, minimize fees and let long term diversified investments take care of market fluctuations. There is no need to invest large amounts. The key is to start small, strategically, and don’t wait until middle age.”

With all that background information, here are seven index funds for long-term portfolios:

Direxion Work From Home ETF (NYSEARCA:WFH) Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (NASDAQ:PDBC) iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) SPDR S&P 500ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSEARCA:FEZ) Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI)

These ETFs cover a wide range of asset classes and allocations, so there’s something for everyone, no matter your investing style.

Story continues

Index Funds to Buy: Direxion Work From Home ETF (WFH)

52-week range: $49.20-$55.83 Expense Ratio: 0.45% per year, or $45 on a $10,000 investment. an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights

The Direxion Work From Home ETF is one of the newest exchange traded funds on the market. It started trading on June 25, at an opening price of $50.08. On August 5, it notched an all-time high of $55.83.

It tracks the Solactive Remote Work Index, which comprises businesses offering technological infrastructure and services in four industries: cloud technologies, cybersecurity, remote communications, online project and document management.

The Solactive Remote Work Index consists of 40 companies, ten from each industry group. The top five holdings of the Direxion Work From Home ETF are Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Inseego (NASDAQ:INSG), Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Avaya (NYSE:AVYA) and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA). These make up approximately 18% of the total value of the fund.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered structural shifts in the way people, worldwide, are now living their lives. 2020 is quickly becoming the year of  ‘home sweet home’ for many.

Thematic investing may enable market participants to diversify their portfolios while capturing trends such as stay-at-home and work-from-home. And this index fund may act as a basis for further research.

As always, investors should consider individual investment goals along with risks/return profiles and charges/expenses of each fund, such as WFH.

Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (PDBC)

52-week range: $11.08-$16.91 Dividend Yield: 1.68% Expense Ratio: 0.61% per year, or $61 on a $10,000 investment. a bunch of oil barrels are stacked high

The Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF invests in commodity-linked futures and other financial instruments that provide access to a diverse group of commodities.

PDBC aims to provide a long-term capital appreciation strategy that surpasses the performance of DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return, an index composed of futures contracts on 14 commodities across energy, precious metals, industrial metals and agriculture.

Gold, Gasoline, Crude Crude and Brent Crude futures have the highest weightings, comprising close to 45% of the funds. Wheat, Sugar, Soybeans and Corn make up 25.61% of the fund, while Copper, Aluminum and Zinc compose 13.93% of the ETF. Other holdings include NY Harbor ULSD, Natural Gas and Silver.

Year-to-date, the fund is down over 16%. Commodity prices are mostly dependent on supply and demand. For example, during a cold winter, as the demand for natural gas increases, so do prices. Commodity prices also typically move higher during inflationary periods, as they are widely considered a hedge against inflation.

Historically, there has been a negative correlation between commodities and stocks. Academic research shows that by investing in commodity futures or ETFs based on these contracts, market participants may be able to decrease the volatility of an all-stock portfolio without reducing their expected return.

Thus investors trying to diversify into commodities should consider this index fund further.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB)

52-week range: $92.15-$146.53 Dividend Yield: 0.29% Expense Ratio: 0.47% per year, or $47 on a $10,000 investment floating molecules representing biotech stocks like SRNE stock

Source: Shutterstock

Launched in 2001, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF is one of the largest ETFs, and it’s run by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager.

The fund tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, comprised of NASDAQ-listed companies classified as either biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies that meet additional criteria.

IBB’s five largest holdings are Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). These five make up around 35% of the fund, which invests in a total of 212 companies.

Year-to-date, IBB is up over 12%. In fact, on July 20, it hit a new all-time high. Given the recent increases in prices of individual shares, there may be some short-term profit-taking around the corner. A decline toward the $125 level is likely, which would provide potential IBB investors with a better entry point.

Within the biopharma industry, IBB could be appropriate for a wide range of long-term buy-and-hold investors with a high tolerance for short-term market fluctuations.

iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)

52-week range: $95.69-$170.56 Dividend Yield: 1.3% Expense Ratio: 0.19% per year, or $19 on a $10,000 investment. a ticker board that says ""SMALL CAP"" among various ticker increases

Source: Shutterstock

Small-cap stocks can boost portfolio diversification and increase potential returns over time. For those looking to invest in U.S.-listed small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF may be a strong candidate.

IWM tracks the Russell 2000 and covers practically all industries. Late-stage biotech Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), in-home healthcare provider LHC Group (NASDAQ:LHCG), footwear corporation Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), global consumer product company Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) and BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) are among the top big name holdings.

6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now

Year-to-date, IWM is down about 6%. Put another way, in recent weeks, small-caps have been lagging large-caps. Over the long-run, small-cap stocks and small-cap index funds often outperform their large-cap counterparts. However, they are typically more volatile.

SPDR S&P 500ETF (SPY)

52-week range: $218.26-$339.10 Dividend Yield: 1.69% Expense Ratio: 0.04% per year, or $4 on a $10,000 investment. Street sign for Wall Street pictured in front of several American flags representing american stocks

The S&P 500 measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies in the US. These companies make up around 80% of the overall US stock market’s value and cover approximately 24 separate industry groups. The capitalization-weighted SPDR S&P 500 ETF follows this index.

For many investors, the S&P’s performance shows how U.S. equities are performing in general. The “Spider” index is one of the most widely followed equity benchmarks in the world.

The SPY index fund value proposition is simple: Investors gain exposure to the growth and profitability of U.S.-based businesses without having to rely too heavily on any individual company’s performance.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (FEZ)

52-Week Range: $24.29 – 41.27 Dividend Yield: 1.59% Expense Ratio: 0.29% per year, or $29 on a $10,000 investment the European Union flag, a circle of gold stars on a navy blue background

Source: Shutterstock

The SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF, which has 50 holdings, follows the Euro Stoxx 50Index. While broader U.S. indices are likely to keep offering plenty of robust stocks, long-term investors may consider diversifying with shares of established companies listed in Europe, too.

The biggest sectors by weighting are Financials (14.08%), Information Technology (13.76%), Consumer Discretionary (13.66%), Industrials (12.42%) and Materials (10.81%). These five sectors account for 65% of the fund.

The total net assets stand at around $1.7 billion and the top ten holdings make up 42% of the fund. FEZ’s top five companies are SAP (NYSE:SAP), ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), Linde (NYSE:LIN), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC:LVMUY). In terms of geography, Eurozone members France, Germany and the Netherlands have the highest contribution, totaling close to 80%.

So far in the year, the fund is down close to 6%. However, it’s up over 50% from its lows of March.

In recent weeks, the economic data out of Europe hasn’t been much to write home about. However, the European Central Bank has announced a large stimulus package that will likely support the economy as well as share prices of solid European businesses.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF offers low-cost access to a broad basket of shares under one umbrella.

VTI, which tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, holds 3531 stocks covering all sectors and capitalizations, from mega- to micro-, in U.S. equity markets. Technology tops the list with a weighting of 26.4%, followed by Financials (16.3%), Consumer Services (14.2%) and Health Care (14.0%).

The fund’s top 3 holdings include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The top ten stocks make up close to a quarter of the fund.

Year-to-date, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is up 5.1%. However, that metric excludes the dividend yield of 1.69%. Research shows that investors who purchase dividend stocks and reinvest the dividends to buy more shares are likely to see considerable growth in their savings.

550,2020-08-21T17:23:54+00:00,5 SPAC Stocks With Recently Agreed On Merger Deals to Watch,"Since my last article several weeks ago about SPAC stocks — SPAC standing for special purpose acquisition company —  I decided to find five more stocks with agreed-on merger deals. Some of these stocks have very serious upside potential. We’re likely to see this on display once their combination with the target private company closes.

As I previously pointed out, one reason for this is very simple. The general investing public tends to wait to buy these stocks until after the combination. In some cases, investors are not aware that you can buy the SPAC stock first. In other cases, they are not aware of the newly public company until it starts trading under its own new symbol.

Therefore, an investor can get in on the bottom floor, so to speak. The potential for huge upside profits, once the combination goes into effect and the stock symbol changes, is very high.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

However, as the list I am presenting below shows, sometimes there are hiccups. In one case there is a lot of drama and that is limiting the price from rising right now. But, as you will see, that in an of itself, presents a value buying opportunity.

7 Safe Stocks to Buy That Can Shrug Off the Growing Volatility

So here are the five SPAC stocks with pre-merger deals:

Landcadia Holdings II (NASDAQ:LCA) Far Point Acquisition Corp (NYSE:FPAC) Software Acquisition Group (NASDAQ:SAQN) Hennessey Capital Acquisition Corp IV (NASDAQ:HCAC) Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp (NYSE:MFAC)

Let’s dive in and look at these.

5 SPAC Stocks With Merger Deals: Landcadia Holdings II (LCA) A man looking at a computer with poker chips on the screen.

Source: rawf8/Shutterstock.com

Merger Target: Golden Nugget Online (Online Casino)

On June 28, Golden Nugget Online Gaming, a U.S. online real money casino owned by Tilman Fertitta, agreed to a reverse merger with Landacadia. This will be the second pure publicly traded online casino, after DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG).

DraftKings now has a $12.6 billion market capitalization. DKNG stock has risen to $35.59 from its pre-merger original $10 SPAC price. By the time it went public, the SPAC price had risen to between $17 and $19 per share. So, essentially, since going public the stock has doubled to its present price of over $35.

Story continues

I suspect the same could happen with Golden Nugget Online Gaming. Its new symbol will be GNOG, once the deal closes sometime this quarter, although a date has yet been set.

One of the key differences is profitability. For example, GNOG just announced its Q2 showed $24.8 million in net revenue and $8.5 million in operating income. This was up 74% year-over-year. By contrast, DraftKings had higher revenue of $70.9 million but lost $160.4 million on an operating basis. So GNOG is much more profitable.

I suspect there will be more of these online casinos going public, as the Wall Street Journal recently wrote. This is especially since physical casinos are losing money head over heals.

However, it looks to me that LCA stock, later to be renamed GNOG, will be a winner. I believe, given its profitability, it will likely double or even more once the merger is approved and the new symbol starts trading.

Far Point Acquisition Corp (FPAC) A man counts money he's holding.

Merger Target: Global Blue (Online Payments)

Far Point Acquisition Corp is slated to combine with Global Blue Group, a Swiss-based payments company. But that deal was announced on Jan. 6, and the deal still has not closed. You also would not know that there even is a deal, since FPAC stock trades below its IPO price of $10 ($9.91, as of Aug. 21).

There has been considerable drama on the deal, as explained in a recent Barron’s article. A special meeting of shareholders is scheduled for Aug. 24 to vote on the deal. Right now, the stock price implies that the deal will not pass. If it does the new symbol on the NYSE will be GB.

Most investors should probably just wait and see what happens with GB stock. Sometimes these deals are better when everyone is on the same side, not working against each other. That seems to be the case here.

However, this could turn into an arbitrage play for astute value players at today’s price. The company has to consummate its Initial Business Combination by Sept. 14.

Otherwise, the $10 IPO money, plus interest, has to be returned to shareholders within 10 days after Sept. 14, after paying all its taxes due. That probably works out to about a 3.3% arbitrage play at today’s price.

Merger Target: CuriosityStream (Subscription Service: Documentaries)

This is another interesting SPAC merger deal. It was just announced on Aug. 11, and yet SAQN stock has not really moved. It is still trading below $10 ($9.98 as of Aug. 21). Once the deal closes in Q4, the new symbol will be CURI.

I find this interesting for another reason. The original founder of Discovery TV, John Hendricks, founded this “pure-play” non-legacy linear TV streaming company, as Deadline magazine framed it. It streams only factual programs like documentaries. CuriosityStream has 13 million subscribers.

CuriosityStream has over 13 million subscribers in over 175 countries. It costs just $19.99 annually if you don’t buy it on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, where it costs $2.99 per month. I decided to do this and so far it works great as an app that I stream to my TV via Chromecast, while I write articles on the computer for InvestorPlace.

I suspect the stock is very undervalued at today’s price. Let’s do some simple estimates. For example, 13 million people paying $19.99 annually is $260 million annually. At 10 times revenue that gives it a valuation of $2.6 billion. Now since SAQN stock today has a market value of just $186.5 million, it implies the stock could rise 14 times. Even at five times revenue, the stock would rise 7x.

This could be a real undiscovered gem in the SPAC stocks space.

Merger Target: Canoo (Electric Vehicle Manufacturer)

This is another recently announced SPAC deal, as of Aug. 18. Canoo is an electric vehicle maker. It projects 2024 revenue of $1.43 billion and its first profit at $188 million. Canoo expects to build 10,000 canoo vehicles in 2022, rising to 50,000 in 2024.

Right now there are 37.5 million HCAC shares outstanding, so at $10.44, the SPAC has a market value of just $391.7 million. However, there are 30 million warrants outstanding that have an exercise price of $10, and so they are not “in-the-money.”  Once the deal closes, the new symbol will be CNOO. Barron’s seems to like Canoo, but the magazine did not put a value on it in a recent article.

Let’s see if we can estimate what will happen with the stock. First, we have to estimate its present market capitalization. I believe its present market cap is now $705 million, even though the warrants would bring in $300 million if exercised (i.e., not in a “cashless” exercise). The company has announced an additional $300 million from a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal at $10 per share. This results in effectively about 87.5 million shares outstanding. That gives HCAC stock a $914 million market cap on a “see-through” basis.

Moreover, with its $600 million in capital raised, the effective market cap is about $1.514 million. Now we can estimate if this is an adequate valuation.

Probably not. Even if we gave the stock a 3 times revenue multiple, or $4.293 billion, and discounted it by 15% for 2 years, the market value should be $3.25 billion. That is 114% higher than today’s price.

9 Top Stocks to Buy for a Weakened Dollar

In other words, HCAC stock is worth at least $22.38 per share, over twice its present price. At a higher revenue multiple, the stock is worth even more.

Merger Target: BankMobile Technologies (Digital Banking Company)

This is a smaller deal, but the merger was announced on Aug. 6 between MFAC and BankMobile. The latter is “one of the largest digital banking platforms in the country with over 2 million accounts.” BankMobile provides its “Banking-as-a-Service” (BaaS) to institutes of higher learning using its BankMobile Disbursements. It reaches more than five million students across the country.

The deal is valued at $140 million and will provide $20 million to the company. The key to understanding this deal is that BankMobile is not a bank. It is a technology platform. It is a division of Customers Bank, based in Western Pennsylvania with $17.9 billion in assets.

I find this arrangement very strange for investors. So far, it is not clear to me how much of this “division” of Customers Bank that the public will own. For example, who has the right to declare dividends — the board of BankMobile or the board of Customers Bank?

This is a very small deal. I believe that on a “see-through” basis, including the $20 million that will be raised, the market capitalization is about $97 million. This is based on MFAC’s present price of $10.28 per share.

Frankly, the deal is too small and too obscure for most investors. I also don’t see any value proposition here. I can’t find the bargain element which is essential for investment consideration.

In summary, I have put together a short table that summarizes most of the main elements of these SPAC stocks deals. You can see below that this table shows my estimates of their effective market values. And it also shows the potential upside — see the far right-hand column. 5 SPAC Stocks Having Recent Merger Deals

Most of these deals have a significant upside. In fact, I would urge you to study their documents carefully, since in some cases it might be worthwhile to buy the warrants or the units instead of the common stocks of the SPAC stocks. I will write about this sometime in the near future, describing the upside and risks.

As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.  Mark Hake runs the Total Yield Value Guide, which you can review here.

551,2020-08-21T17:23:54+00:00,5 SPAC Stocks With Recently Agreed On Merger Deals to Watch,"Since my last article several weeks ago about SPAC stocks — SPAC standing for special purpose acquisition company —  I decided to find five more stocks with agreed-on merger deals. Some of these stocks have very serious upside potential. We’re likely to see this on display once their combination with the target private company closes.

As I previously pointed out, one reason for this is very simple. The general investing public tends to wait to buy these stocks until after the combination. In some cases, investors are not aware that you can buy the SPAC stock first. In other cases, they are not aware of the newly public company until it starts trading under its own new symbol.

Therefore, an investor can get in on the bottom floor, so to speak. The potential for huge upside profits, once the combination goes into effect and the stock symbol changes, is very high.

However, as the list I am presenting below shows, sometimes there are hiccups. In one case there is a lot of drama and that is limiting the price from rising right now. But, as you will see, that in an of itself, presents a value buying opportunity.

7 Safe Stocks to Buy That Can Shrug Off the Growing Volatility

So here are the five SPAC stocks with pre-merger deals:

Landcadia Holdings II (NASDAQ:LCA) Far Point Acquisition Corp (NYSE:FPAC) Software Acquisition Group (NASDAQ:SAQN) Hennessey Capital Acquisition Corp IV (NASDAQ:HCAC) Megalith Financial Acquisition Corp (NYSE:MFAC)

Let’s dive in and look at these.

5 SPAC Stocks With Merger Deals: Landcadia Holdings II (LCA) A man looking at a computer with poker chips on the screen.

Merger Target: Golden Nugget Online (Online Casino)

On June 28, Golden Nugget Online Gaming, a U.S. online real money casino owned by Tilman Fertitta, agreed to a reverse merger with Landacadia. This will be the second pure publicly traded online casino, after DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG).

DraftKings now has a $12.6 billion market capitalization. DKNG stock has risen to $35.59 from its pre-merger original $10 SPAC price. By the time it went public, the SPAC price had risen to between $17 and $19 per share. So, essentially, since going public the stock has doubled to its present price of over $35.

Story continues

I suspect the same could happen with Golden Nugget Online Gaming. Its new symbol will be GNOG, once the deal closes sometime this quarter, although a date has yet been set.

One of the key differences is profitability. For example, GNOG just announced its Q2 showed $24.8 million in net revenue and $8.5 million in operating income. This was up 74% year-over-year. By contrast, DraftKings had higher revenue of $70.9 million but lost $160.4 million on an operating basis. So GNOG is much more profitable.

I suspect there will be more of these online casinos going public, as the Wall Street Journal recently wrote. This is especially since physical casinos are losing money head over heals.

However, it looks to me that LCA stock, later to be renamed GNOG, will be a winner. I believe, given its profitability, it will likely double or even more once the merger is approved and the new symbol starts trading.

Merger Target: Global Blue (Online Payments)

Far Point Acquisition Corp is slated to combine with Global Blue Group, a Swiss-based payments company. But that deal was announced on Jan. 6, and the deal still has not closed. You also would not know that there even is a deal, since FPAC stock trades below its IPO price of $10 ($9.91, as of Aug. 21).

There has been considerable drama on the deal, as explained in a recent Barron’s article. A special meeting of shareholders is scheduled for Aug. 24 to vote on the deal. Right now, the stock price implies that the deal will not pass. If it does the new symbol on the NYSE will be GB.

Most investors should probably just wait and see what happens with GB stock. Sometimes these deals are better when everyone is on the same side, not working against each other. That seems to be the case here.

However, this could turn into an arbitrage play for astute value players at today’s price. The company has to consummate its Initial Business Combination by Sept. 14.

Otherwise, the $10 IPO money, plus interest, has to be returned to shareholders within 10 days after Sept. 14, after paying all its taxes due. That probably works out to about a 3.3% arbitrage play at today’s price.

Merger Target: CuriosityStream (Subscription Service: Documentaries)

This is another interesting SPAC merger deal. It was just announced on Aug. 11, and yet SAQN stock has not really moved. It is still trading below $10 ($9.98 as of Aug. 21). Once the deal closes in Q4, the new symbol will be CURI.

I find this interesting for another reason. The original founder of Discovery TV, John Hendricks, founded this “pure-play” non-legacy linear TV streaming company, as Deadline magazine framed it. It streams only factual programs like documentaries. CuriosityStream has 13 million subscribers.

CuriosityStream has over 13 million subscribers in over 175 countries. It costs just $19.99 annually if you don’t buy it on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, where it costs $2.99 per month. I decided to do this and so far it works great as an app that I stream to my TV via Chromecast, while I write articles on the computer for InvestorPlace.

I suspect the stock is very undervalued at today’s price. Let’s do some simple estimates. For example, 13 million people paying $19.99 annually is $260 million annually. At 10 times revenue that gives it a valuation of $2.6 billion. Now since SAQN stock today has a market value of just $186.5 million, it implies the stock could rise 14 times. Even at five times revenue, the stock would rise 7x.

This could be a real undiscovered gem in the SPAC stocks space.

Merger Target: Canoo (Electric Vehicle Manufacturer)

This is another recently announced SPAC deal, as of Aug. 18. Canoo is an electric vehicle maker. It projects 2024 revenue of $1.43 billion and its first profit at $188 million. Canoo expects to build 10,000 canoo vehicles in 2022, rising to 50,000 in 2024.

Right now there are 37.5 million HCAC shares outstanding, so at $10.44, the SPAC has a market value of just $391.7 million. However, there are 30 million warrants outstanding that have an exercise price of $10, and so they are not “in-the-money.”  Once the deal closes, the new symbol will be CNOO. Barron’s seems to like Canoo, but the magazine did not put a value on it in a recent article.

Let’s see if we can estimate what will happen with the stock. First, we have to estimate its present market capitalization. I believe its present market cap is now $705 million, even though the warrants would bring in $300 million if exercised (i.e., not in a “cashless” exercise). The company has announced an additional $300 million from a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal at $10 per share. This results in effectively about 87.5 million shares outstanding. That gives HCAC stock a $914 million market cap on a “see-through” basis.

Moreover, with its $600 million in capital raised, the effective market cap is about $1.514 million. Now we can estimate if this is an adequate valuation.

Probably not. Even if we gave the stock a 3 times revenue multiple, or $4.293 billion, and discounted it by 15% for 2 years, the market value should be $3.25 billion. That is 114% higher than today’s price.

9 Top Stocks to Buy for a Weakened Dollar

In other words, HCAC stock is worth at least $22.38 per share, over twice its present price. At a higher revenue multiple, the stock is worth even more.

Merger Target: BankMobile Technologies (Digital Banking Company)

This is a smaller deal, but the merger was announced on Aug. 6 between MFAC and BankMobile. The latter is “one of the largest digital banking platforms in the country with over 2 million accounts.” BankMobile provides its “Banking-as-a-Service” (BaaS) to institutes of higher learning using its BankMobile Disbursements. It reaches more than five million students across the country.

The deal is valued at $140 million and will provide $20 million to the company. The key to understanding this deal is that BankMobile is not a bank. It is a technology platform. It is a division of Customers Bank, based in Western Pennsylvania with $17.9 billion in assets.

I find this arrangement very strange for investors. So far, it is not clear to me how much of this “division” of Customers Bank that the public will own. For example, who has the right to declare dividends — the board of BankMobile or the board of Customers Bank?

This is a very small deal. I believe that on a “see-through” basis, including the $20 million that will be raised, the market capitalization is about $97 million. This is based on MFAC’s present price of $10.28 per share.

Frankly, the deal is too small and too obscure for most investors. I also don’t see any value proposition here. I can’t find the bargain element which is essential for investment consideration.

In summary, I have put together a short table that summarizes most of the main elements of these SPAC stocks deals. You can see below that this table shows my estimates of their effective market values. And it also shows the potential upside — see the far right-hand column. 5 SPAC Stocks Having Recent Merger Deals

Most of these deals have a significant upside. In fact, I would urge you to study their documents carefully, since in some cases it might be worthwhile to buy the warrants or the units instead of the common stocks of the SPAC stocks. I will write about this sometime in the near future, describing the upside and risks.

552,2020-08-21T12:24:48+00:00,There’s a Reason Why Ocugen Is a Last Resort in Eye Care,"The last time I wrote about Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN), OCGN stock was up 34% only halfway through the month of January. Since then, a whole bunch of stuff happened, some of it good, some of it bad, none of it worthy of you betting the farm on the clinical-stage biopharma company.

Here’s why.

There Are Better Eye Care Options Than OCGN Stock

I’m big on reminding investors that they’ve always got options. More so today, with fractional share investing putting your spare change to work.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now

Ten years ago, Ocugen stock would have been a compelling penny stock investment merely because it was trading under a buck. That’s no longer important. In 2020, if I want to buy $100 of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), fractional investing allows me to do so. No questions asked.

Howard Lindzon, the founder of StockTwits, stated in 2016 that fractional share investing was something long overdue.

“My daughter is in college and last year she started buying individual stocks on Robinhood. One of her first buys was Amazon. She bought 1 share of stock for $547 and today it is $837.

She can only sell the 1 share or buy more full shares,” a quote Lindzon recently revisited.

“She would love to be able to sell $300 worth of Amazon and diversify into $100 of 3 more stocks so she can start building her own portfolio. It’s not rocket science to build or teach portfolio construction and risk management with the tools we have today.”

Well, today she can. And that makes the purchase of OCGN stock unnecessary except for the most speculative investors or those very familiar with ophthalmology treatments.

I’m neither and so is 99% of the population.

How Have Eye Care Stocks Performed in 2020?

In my January article, in addition to Ocugen, I mentioned two other eye care companies: Alcon (NYSE:ALC), and National Vision Holdings (NASDAQ:EYE). Year-to-date through Aug. 17, OCGN stock is down -4.4%, ALC is up 9%, and EYE’s also gained 9%. That compares to 6.2% for the U.S. markets as a whole.

Story continues

At the time, I argued that Alcon’s multi-year transformation should push its stock higher than $61. While it’s still trading around $61, if you’d bought below $40 in the March correction, you would be sitting on paper gains of more than 50%. Not too shabby.

On July 14, Alcon announced the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of its Pataday Once Daily Relief Extra Strength, the first over-the-counter eye allergy drop offering 24-hour relief without a prescription.

As an allergy sufferer, anything that’s easy to buy and helps keep things under control is a welcome addition.

Six months later, I still believe that ALC and EYE make better eye care investments than Ocugen.

The Bottom Line

InvestorPlace’s Chris Markoch recently stated that Ocugen would be a penny stock for years.

“[I]f you’re considering buying thousands of shares on a stock that looks like it’s ready to explode, I’d urge you to look again. OCU400 is not scheduled to receive FDA approval until 2025. And that’s if everything goes well, which is frequently not the case as it relates to biotech companies,” Markoch wrote Aug. 17.

“The allure of a penny stock is easy to understand. But please remember that Ocugen is operating with no revenue. And the earliest prospects for it to start generating revenue are five years away.”

When I wrote about Ocugen in January, OCU300 was still very much in the conversation. On June 1, the company discontinued its Phase 3 clinical trial on the drug. Now that it appears to be making headway on OCU400, the speculators are back in the game.

For me, when it comes to eye care, Ocugen is the stock of last resort.

The company failed to pay $14 million of interest due July 22 on its 5.6% 2025 dollar notes, and is in a 30-day grace period that expires Friday. If payment were not made within the grace period, it would constitute a default -- the first by an Indian company on a dollar security since March.

Adding to signs of strains in the broader conglomerate, another Future Group unit said it has defaulted on a rupee note interest payment.

Future Retail is in discussions with lenders led by State Bank of India to raise cash to help pay the interest on the dollar security, but the banks had declined to commit to the financing, people familiar with the matter said Thursday.

Future’s cash crunch has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, which was the world’s biggest. Its woes are emblematic of broader challenges Indian businesses face as the economy is forecast to contract for the first time in four decades. While a crunch in the debt market has eased after central bank stimulus, the creditworthiness of many borrowers remains strained.

555,2020-08-19T09:42:25+00:00,Amazon expands Morrisons deal with full-range offer,"By James Davey

LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Amazon has stepped up its move into Britain's grocery market, expanding its relationship with Morrisons so Prime members have access to the supermarket group's full range on the internet giant's main website.

Amazon and Morrisons have had a tie-up since 2016 and have been steadily expanding their links, leading to speculation that the U.S. group could even emerge as a possible bidder for Britain's No. 4 supermarket chain. Both sides habitually decline comment on such market talk.

The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in demand for online groceries. Market researcher Nielsen said on Tuesday online grocery participation had grown to 14% of the UK grocery market in the 12 weeks to Aug. 8, double its pre-crisis rate.

Amazon and Morrisons said on Wednesday that Prime members would as part of their subscription be able to receive same-day delivery on orders of more than 40 pounds ($53) for no extra cost directly on the Amazon.co.uk website.

For orders worth less than 40 pounds there will be a 3.99 pound delivery charge.

They said ""Morrisons on Amazon"" launched in Leeds, northern England, and will be expanded to millions of Prime members across the United Kingdom in the coming weeks.

It will offer thousands of grocery products including meat, seafood, dairy and baked goods, fruit and vegetables. Prices will be the same as at Morrisons' stores.

Orders will be picked from local Morrisons stores by Morrisons staff and delivered to customers by Amazon partners.

Prime is Amazon's core retail proposition, costing an annual membership fee of 79 pounds. Membership provides access to unlimited one-day delivery as well as services such as TV, movies and music.

The Morrisons deal builds on Amazon's move last month to begin free delivery of its own grocery service to Prime members.

Morrisons, which has a 10.2% market share, trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda in annual sales.

Earlier this week Tesco CEO Dave Lewis told The Sunday Telegraph it planned to add free delivery to its Clubcard Plus loyalty scheme.

SAO PAULO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian online coupon and cash rebates provider Meliuz has hired banks to manage an initial public offering, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Investment banking units of Banco BTG Pactual SA, Banco Bradesco SA, XP Inc and Itau Unibanco Holding SA will manage the offering, expected by the end of this year.

One of the sources said the offering is likely to raise 800 million reais ($148.81 million), but added that no final decision has been taken.

Founded by Israel Salmen and Ofli Guimaraes in 2011, Meliuz has roughly 10 million registered users and partners with retailers such as Magazine Luiza SA, Lojas Americanas SA, and Amazon, as well as with other providers like Uber Technologies.

Meliuz also offers fee-free credit cards in partnership with Banco Pan SA that refund up to 1.8% of purchases.

Amid the coronavirus crisis, Meliuz has also launched a referral service. If a customer recommends a store to a friend and that person buys a product or service from it, the referring customer receives a payment on the sale.

Meliuz's investors include venture capital funds Monashees, Lumia Capital and Endeavor Catalyst and angel investor Fabrice Grinda.

SAO PAULO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian online coupon and cash rebates provider Meliuz has hired banks to manage an initial public offering, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Investment banking units of Banco BTG Pactual SA, Banco Bradesco SA, XP Inc and Itau Unibanco Holding SA will manage the offering, expected by the end of this year.

One of the sources said the offering is likely to raise 800 million reais ($148.81 million), but added that no final decision has been taken.

Founded by Israel Salmen and Ofli Guimaraes in 2011, Meliuz has roughly 10 million registered users and partners with retailers such as Magazine Luiza SA, Lojas Americanas SA, and Amazon, as well as with other providers like Uber Technologies.

Meliuz also offers fee-free credit cards in partnership with Banco Pan SA that refund up to 1.8% of purchases.

Amid the coronavirus crisis, Meliuz has also launched a referral service. If a customer recommends a store to a friend and that person buys a product or service from it, the referring customer receives a payment on the sale.

Meliuz's investors include venture capital funds Monashees, Lumia Capital and Endeavor Catalyst and angel investor Fabrice Grinda.

561,2020-08-11T10:40:15+00:00,SoftBank Moves Into Asset Management After Return to Profits,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is launching a new asset management venture to buy stocks in publicly traded companies, expanding SoftBank Group Corp.’s investment efforts as it rebounded from record losses to profitability.

The Tokyo-based company reported net income of 1.26 trillion yen ($11.8 billion) for the three months ended June 30, following a loss of 1.44 trillion yen three months earlier. The profit was boosted by more than 1 trillion yen in one-time gains from the sale of Sprint Corp. and shares in T-Mobile US Inc.

Son has shifted his attention to investments in recent years after building his fortune in the telecom sector. The asset management initiative expands on previous efforts like the $100 billion Vision Fund, which he set up three years ago to take stakes in private startups. The new arm has already purchased shares in Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.

“As an investment company, we need to explore various angles and scope. But our focus is still on companies driving the information revolution,” said Son. “This is the purpose of our company.”

SoftBank will own 67% of the asset management firm, while Son personally will own the rest. The unit has about $555 million in capital, he said.

It’s not clear why Son thinks SoftBank will have an edge in picking stocks, moving into a field crowded with heavyweights like Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. The effort may increase the volatility of SoftBank earnings, which has grown with initiatives like the Vision Fund.

“Investors will need to build greater risk into their expectations -- and Masa investing alongside is not a good look,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Research who writes for Smartkarma. “Launching a new investment vehicle targeted at public tech when Nasdaq is near all-time highs with bubble concerns seems like a good way to keep the share price discount to public value from closing.”

The Japanese billionaire has pulled off a remarkably speedy comeback after the worst loss in his company’s 39-year history. A global rally in technology shares lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio, from China’s Didi Chuxing to South Korea’s Coupang.

Far from striking a winning pose on Tuesday however, Son emphasized the importance of defense. He opened his presentation with slides depicting a 16th century battle between two Japanese lords. Oda Nobunaga, who would go on to unify Japan, won the engagement by sheltering his riflemen inside a wooden structure to protect them from samurai on horseback.

“You can’t skimp on defense,” Son said. “We need to strengthen our defense. Defense is cash.”

SoftBank also stopped reporting operating profit, long a key metric tracked by investors. It said the figure is “no longer meaningful” as the company becomes a “strategic investment holding company.”

SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt. The company already raised 4.3 trillion yen through sales that include stakes in T-Mobile, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its domestic telecom unit, completing about 95% of the program.

The Vision Fund returned to profitability, following a 1.13 trillion yen loss in the previous quarter. SoftBank booked a 296.6 billion yen gain on Vision Fund investments in the quarter, including 111.4 billion yen in realized gains after selling a portion of its shares in four listed portfolio companies. About $1.4 billion of the unrealized gains came from holdings in public companies, with Uber responsible for about $700 million and Ping An Good Doctor, Vir Biotechnology Inc. and Guardant Health Inc. contributing about $200 million each.

“It’s still too early to say that it will be all profits at the Vision Fund going forward,” Son said in a live-streamed briefing. “But things are turning around in a big way.”

Several SoftBank-backed companies have also pulled off successful initial public offerings, raising the prospects for more in the future. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. more than doubled in the days after its initial public offering last month, while oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. has surged about the same amount since its trading debut.

Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage backed by SoftBank, said last week it is seeking to raise about $2 billion in a U.S. IPO. DoorDash Inc., a U.S. food delivery company backed by SoftBank, has filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and e-commerce giant Coupang are preparing for offerings in 2021.

Son confirmed that SoftBank is looking to sell or take public Arm Ltd., the chip design firm that he bought four years ago for $32 billion. He said he may accelerate plans for an Arm IPO from the original 2023 schedule or he may sell part or all of the firm. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talked to acquire Arm.

Son put plans for a second Vision Fund on hold after missteps, including the meltdown at WeWork. Now, the fund’s upbeat results and a renewed investor appetite for risk could revive the idea, according to Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group.

”Our strategy hasn’t changed,” Son said at the briefing. “We still plan on unicorn hunting with Vision Fund 2, 3 and so on.”

562,2020-08-06T22:07:22+00:00,Son’s SoftBank Poised to Return to Profit After Big Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- After reporting record losses in May and warning the coronavirus outbreak could be as devastating as the Great Depression, SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is already poised to declare a recovery.

When it announces results next week, the Tokyo-based company is projected to report operating income of more than $1 billion for the quarter ended in June, according to analyst estimates. The Vision Fund is likely to post a profit, three months after a $17.7 billion loss on tumbling valuations for its portfolio companies.

Son, who suffered disaster on top of fiasco in the months through March, has had almost everything go his way since then. A global rally in tech shares has lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The initial public offering market has turned red-hot, boosting the prospects for his portfolio of about 90 startups. SoftBank’s shares have climbed to a two-decade high with the help of record buybacks.

“For the next few years, valuations will continue to rise and Son will look like a genius investor again,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. “Considering how much the overall stock markets have climbed recently, it’s only natural that private valuations at the Vision Fund should rise too.”

SoftBank uses a number of approaches to value its stakes in private companies, including taking cues from their latest financing rounds and the valuations of publicly traded rivals. The exact mechanism is not disclosed, which makes earnings at the Vision Fund something of a black box. But after taking massive writedowns across the board in the last fiscal year, for most portfolio companies that remain in business the only way is up.

Below are the key things that have boosted Son and SoftBank’s fortunes since March.

The Tech Rally

After a broad plunge in markets early this year with the coronavirus outbreak, tech stocks have been surging worldwide. Nasdaq, driven by the likes of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., climbed more than 30% in the second quarter.

Story continues

For SoftBank, Uber rebounded 11% last quarter after tumbling in the first quarter, and is now trading around the $33 price the Japanese company paid in early 2018. That may allow SoftBank to mark up the valuations of its other ride-hailing startups, the most significant part of its portfolio with stakes in Didi Chuxing in China, Southeast Asia’s Grab and Ola in India.

SoftBank-backed Slack Technologies Inc., the workplace-collaboration software company seen as a key beneficiary of the pandemic, climbed about 30% this year. ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co. rose about 75%. Guardant Health Inc., a cancer-detection company in which the Japanese conglomerate is the largest shareholder, added 17% last quarter.

IPO Thaw

WeWork’s implosion and Uber’s disappointing debut last year were seen as a signal the public markets were wary of the fast-growing, money-losing companies that SoftBank tends to back. But investors’ appetite for riskier equities has been rekindled, perhaps by the tech rally and central banks’ aggressive actions to fight the pandemic.

One marquee SoftBank investment is the online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc., which more than doubled since its initial public offering last month. SoftBank owns a 21.8% stake that is now worth about $750 million, more than double its investment last year. Lemonade has yet to turn profitable since its inception in 2015.

Oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. surged more than 85% since its trading debut last month. The Vision Fund invested $300 million in Relay in 2018 and holds a 41% stake in the company. Relay had a net loss of $75 million for 2019.

The successes could pave the way for more listings from the fund, helping Son deliver on his promise of several IPOs a year. Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage, is planning an offering within a month, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank in January invested $1.3 billion at a $10 billion valuation, which is likely to double in the IPO, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are public.

DoorDash Inc., a food delivery company, in February filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Corp. are also preparing for offerings in 2021.

Sell, sell, sell

Son, who was long criticized for his unwillingness to exit investments, has been on an unprecedented selling spree in the past few months. SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets, including stock in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and its domestic telecom unit. The proceeds will be used to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt.

SoftBank is also selling its stake in OSIsoft LLC. Son paid close to $1 billion for a 45% stake in 2017, valuing the industrial software maker at $2 billion at the time, according to the person familiar. The company is now in talks for a sale at more than $4 billion, Bloomberg News has reported.

By far the biggest deal would be the sale of the sale of Arm Ltd., the chip designer SoftBank bought for $32 billion four years ago. Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire the company and the two parties aim to reach a deal in the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. SoftBank sold a 25% stake in Arm to the Vision Fund for $8 billion, as part of its capital contribution to the fund.

Buyback Bonanza

SoftBank shares have soared more than 140% from their March low to hit a two-decade high. The billionaire has long complained that the shares are traded at less than the value of its portfolio of investments, but this year he made his most concerted effort to narrow the gap.

Starting with March, Son announced an unprecedented string of buybacks totaling 2.5 trillion yen. SoftBank has already repurchased 1 trillion yen worth of stock as of Aug. 3. Two tranches still remain, one running until March 31 next year and another until July 30.

“The actual earnings results at the Vision Fund are less important these days, having been overshadowed by the massive share buybacks,” Jefferies’s Goyal said.

564,2020-08-04T23:01:00+00:00,"TV viewing surges during Britain's lockdown, led by streaming services","By Paul Sandle

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Britons spent 40% of their waking day watching TV and online video at the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in April, including spending twice as long watching streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video, regulator Ofcom said.

Adults, who were advised by the government in late March to stay at home, spent on average six hours and 25 minutes a day watching news and entertainment, Ofcom said, a rise of almost a third on the same month a year ago.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on May 10 that lockdown measures would be eased was the most watched programme of the year so far, with 18.7 million viewers, while the imposition of lockdown on March 23 was second with 14.6 million.

Queen Elizabeth's broadcast to the nation was third with 14 million.

When they were not watching news and information about the pandemic, Britons increasingly turned to video streaming services for entertainment.

An estimated 12 million adults signed up to a new streaming service in the first weeks of lockdown, of whom 3 million had never subscribed to one before, Ofcom said.

Disney+, which was launched by the U.S. entertainment group in Britain on the first day of lockdown, made an immediate impact, attracting 16% of online adults by early July to become the third-ranked service behind Netflix, which had 45%, and Amazon Prime Video, with 39%.

Traditional broadcasters, led by the publicly funded BBC and its commercial rival ITV, briefly achieved their highest combined share of broadcast TV viewing in more than six years in March.

But the boost proved short lived and their share dropped back by June as the pandemic interrupted the production of soap operas, major sporting events and entertainment shows, Ofcom said.

Launching an app by marketing into an audience of users that is proven to pay for similar apps is typically nine times more effective in getting subscriptions or in-app payments compared with conventional ""spray and pray"" demographic-only marketing. By selecting audiences from Bango Marketplace, Nonvoice can ensure that innovative apps get a faster return on marketing, giving a faster return on investment and bringing the benefits of 5G to a broader range of users.

Nonvoice will be working with the Bango Marketplace data scientists to identify new paying user segments that are optimized to the most advanced and innovative premium apps. Bango expects to develop and test special purpose ""5G audiences"" by using Nonvoice’s expertise and data, and some of these will be made generally available through Bango Marketplace.

Nonvoice CEO Simon Buckingham commented: ""Partnering with Bango to use this innovative way to increase the number of people who can enjoy the full experience of leading revenue generating 5G apps is an exciting opportunity. We are always eager to improve the return on marketing investment for our clients. Focussing marketing using Bango Audiences has shown up to a nine fold increase in conversion to payment and we can share our expertise more widely through Bango Marketplace.""

Ray Anderson, Exec Chair at Bango commented: ""We welcome Nonvoice as a partner in our recently established Bango Marketplace Partner Program and look forward to working with them to support the ambitious growth objectives of their clients. Our data shows that users with 5G handsets and connectivity generate a higher average revenue per user (ARPU) than a general consumer. By focussing on the highest spenders, app launches generate their first revenues faster, making further investment both easier to obtain and higher yield""

569,2020-07-30T10:21:21+00:00,Anti-Amazon campaigners in France team up to say 'non' to firm’s expansion,"By Christian Lowe, Elizabeth Pineau and Mathieu Rosemain

COLOMBIER-SAUGNIEU, France (Reuters) - At his veterinary practice near the French city of Lyon one morning in June, Gilles Renevier prepared to perform a castration on a poodle. When not attending to animals, he turns to his other role: attempting to neuter the expansion ambitions of Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>.

Renevier leads a group of local volunteers that has succeeded in suspending construction at a site that campaigners and a senior local official say is earmarked to become a logistics hub for the online retailer. Building at the site is on hold while a legal challenge the vet helped spearhead makes its way through the courts.

In France, disparate anti-Amazon forces – including local activists, environmentalists, trade unions and members of parliament - are coming together to battle the world’s largest online retailer. In some instances, they have received funding from some of the world’s wealthiest philanthropists. The aim: to stop the e-commerce giant from expanding its presence arguing the U.S.-based company destroys retail jobs, exploits workers and harms the environment – arguments Amazon rejects.

Amazon opponents scored a high-profile victory in April when, following a separate legal challenge brought by trade union workers and backed by environmental lobby group Friends of the Earth, a French court ruled the firm was not adequately protecting its employees from COVID-19. Amazon, which disputed the court’s findings, responded by closing its French warehouses and distribution centres for 35 days. The company has since agreed a deal with unions and re-opened the hubs, but the ruling has emboldened the company’s critics elsewhere – including in the United States.

Renevier, a silver-haired 59-year old, is the unpaid head of a group of local campaigners called Fracture that along with another local group – and with backing from Friends of the Earth – is trying to stop Amazon expanding its footprint in France’s south east. Before dealing with his surgical list that June morning, he stopped by the empty construction site.

Story continues

The vet, who lives 14 kilometres from the site, said he was concerned about the traffic and pollution an Amazon logistics hub would cause and believed that Amazon promoted a consumerist way of life that was harmful to society.

""How are we going to reduce the pollution when you have a big operation like this, with so many vehicles that are going to be circulating around it?"" he said. He added that he didn’t shop at Amazon.com and was trying – so far unsuccessfully – to persuade his adult son to stop doing so.

Amazon representatives declined to comment on whether the firm was connected to the Lyon site or on the activities of the company’s opponents.

The representatives said the company was good for the environment because its distribution model was more efficient than traditional retail, and therefore involved fewer miles travelled and less pollution. They said the company’s business model complements, rather than destroys, bricks and mortar retail and that it works closely with small French firms who use Amazon’s logistics network. They also said the company generates thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly.

FACING OPPOSITION

France is particularly fertile ground for Amazon sceptics. It is a country that is historically queasy about U.S.-style capitalism, has strong trade unions, and an attachment to the kind of mom-and-pop neighbourhood stores that, in some cases, feel threatened by Amazon.

In addition to legal action, Amazon’s opponents in France are engaging in a range of tactics from direct action that has involved storming the company’s sites and lobbying for legislation to impose a two-year moratorium on distribution sites of the scale that the online retailer operates. France’s new environment minister, Barbara Pompili, last week said she backs a moratorium, without specifying the length.

It’s not the only country where Amazon faces opposition. In Germany, the company’s largest market after the United States, workers at six Amazon sites went on short-term strike over safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the United States, Amazon workers in Michigan, New York, Illinois and Minnesota staged walkouts to demand safer working conditions in the epidemic.

Amazon workers filed a case in June against the online retailer in the U.S district court for the eastern district of New York alleging the firm did not adequately protect workers from COVID-19 at a facility on Staten island, New York. Three of the French unions that were involved in the case in France have also asked the US court if they can take part in the New York case, which is ongoing.

The French ruling “sends a significant message to Amazon workers in the United States and everywhere,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which itself petitioned the court in the New York case to participate on the side of the Amazon workers.

Amazon has said its distribution centres in France, the United States and elsewhere are safe.

On the U.S. case, Lisa Levandowski, Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation.” In a June 30 court filing, Amazon’s lawyers said the plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed because they were “unsupported by any plausible allegations,” among other reasons.

The company does have supporters in France. Christian Poiret, mayor of a district in northern France where Amazon has a distribution centre, said he fought to attract the online retailer in order to generate jobs in the area. He added that he’s concerned about the actions of the anti-Amazon campaigners because of “the image we’re sending to foreign investors.”

An Élysée official said French President Emmanuel Macron’s administration has not changed its policy: “Amazon’s sites have been welcome and are welcome.”

BATTLEGROUND FRANCE

For Amazon, France offers potential for growth. Amazon has an estimated 19% share of the French business-to-consumer e-commerce market, significantly lower than its 42% share in Germany, according to market researcher Forrester Research.

Amazon doesn’t disclose its French revenues but says the country is a smaller market for the company than the UK and Germany.

The company says it has in the past three years doubled the number of people it directly employs in France to 9,300. That is a faster rate than it has increased its workforce in each of the UK and Germany during the same period. And, Amazon plans to open another big distribution centre in northern France in the next few months, a company representative said.

Amazon is also planning to set up a big distribution centre in Metz, near France’s border with Luxembourg, according to Jean-Luc Bohl, who until earlier this month was mayor of Metz Metropolitan area local government. Amazon representatives declined to comment.

The planned project Renevier is seeking to block is for a 160,000-square-metre logistics hub near Lyon airport.Amazon isn’t named in the planning application, which was submitted by the French arm of an Australian-headquartered property developer called Goodman Group <GMG.AX> that specializes in building logistics hubs.

But Amazon would ultimately operate the site, say campaigners and David Kimelfeld, who until earlier this month was head of the Lyon Metropolitan area local government, a region that is close to the site. Kimelfeld said he had attended meetings with other local officials where Amazon’s involvement with the project was discussed. Reuters was unable to independently confirm discussion of Amazon’s involvement during the meetings.

Goodman France didn’t respond to a request for comment. Parent company Goodman Group said: “Given there is a case before the courts, we are not in a position to make a comment at this time, other than to say there have been two previous rounds of litigation where we were successful both times.”

Renevier’s Fracture and the other local group filed suits in the Lyon administrative tribunal in 2018 and 2019 alleging irregularities in the planning application, including that Goodman is not the ultimate operator of the hub. The tribunal ruled against the groups late last year, a decision Renevier and his allies appealed in January.

SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS

The lawyer representing Renevier’s group in the legal challenge is now being assisted by a lawyer seconded by the Friends of the Earth national headquarters in Paris. Friends of the Earth also campaigned in a municipal election in May against a local mayor who backed the project.

It is part of a broader campaign by the lobby group against Amazon, which it says has created an unsustainable economic model that is harmful for the planet and for humans.Some of the Amazon-related activities of Friends of the Earth are funded indirectly by the European Climate Foundation, which distributes grants on behalf of donors including a Rockefeller family philanthropic fund, Michael Bloomberg, the family foundation of computer mogul William Hewlett and the IKEA founder’s foundation.

ECF’s executive director of strategic communications, Tom Brookes, said the grant was to fund a range of the environmental lobby group’s activities but that the foundation was aware at the time of the award that some money would be used in its Amazon campaign. Brooke added that donors weren’t necessarily aware of where individual grants go.

The lead campaigner on Amazon for the French chapter of Friends of the Earth, Alma Dufour, said most of the ECF’s grant goes towards broader grassroots climate initiatives and the amount spent on targeting Amazon is small. Brooke and Dufour declined to comment on the size of the grant.

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation said it provided general support for ECF for its broad mission on climate change, but not specifically for the Amazon campaign. The IKEA foundation said it had a shared mission with ECF relating to the environment but didn’t address specific questions about Amazon. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies did not respond to requests for comment.

Open Society Foundations, founded and chaired by U.S. billionaire George Soros, said it provided 9,000 euros to the French chapter of Friends of the Earth to support its campaign to protect low-wage and informal workers and small shop owners in the pandemic.

Friends of the Earth said the money was specifically for the Amazon campaign. Open Society referred questions about how the money was spent to the environmental group, but the foundation’s chief communications officer Laura Silber said: “Like any other workplace, Amazon must be held accountable to its workers.” Soros, contacted via Open Society, did not respond to questions about Amazon.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies did not respond to requests for comment.

Open Society Foundations, founded and chaired by U.S. billionaire George Soros, said it provided 9,000 euros to the French chapter of Friends of the Earth to support its campaign to protect low-wage and informal workers and small shop owners in the pandemic.

Friends of the Earth said the money was specifically for the Amazon campaign. Open Society referred questions about how the money was spent to the environmental group, but the foundation’s chief communications officer Laura Silber said: “Like any other workplace, Amazon must be held accountable to its workers.” Soros, contacted via Open Society, did not respond to questions about Amazon.

572,2020-07-30T10:00:58+00:00,INSIGHT-Anti-Amazon campaigners in France team up to say “non” to firm’s expansion,"By Christian Lowe, Elizabeth Pineau and Mathieu Rosemain

COLOMBIER-SAUGNIEU, France, July 30 (Reuters) - At his veterinary practice near the French city of Lyon one morning in June, Gilles Renevier prepared to perform a castration on a poodle. When not attending to animals, he turns to his other role: attempting to neuter the expansion ambitions of Amazon.com Inc. Renevier leads a group of local volunteers that has succeeded in suspending construction at a site that campaigners and a senior local official say is earmarked to become a logistics hub for the online retailer. Building at the site is on hold while a legal challenge the vet helped spearhead makes its way through the courts.

In France, disparate anti-Amazon forces – including local activists, environmentalists, trade unions and members of parliament - are coming together to battle the world’s largest online retailer. In some instances, they have received funding from some of the world’s wealthiest philanthropists. The aim: to stop the e-commerce giant from expanding its presence arguing the U.S.-based company destroys retail jobs, exploits workers and harms the environment – arguments Amazon rejects.

Amazon opponents scored a high-profile victory in April when, following a separate legal challenge brought by trade union workers and backed by environmental lobby group Friends of the Earth, a French court ruled the firm was not adequately protecting its employees from COVID-19. Amazon, which disputed the court’s findings, responded by closing its French warehouses and distribution centres for 35 days. The company has since agreed a deal with unions and re-opened the hubs, but the ruling has emboldened the company’s critics elsewhere – including in the United States.

Renevier, a silver-haired 59-year old, is the unpaid head of a group of local campaigners called Fracture that along with another local group – and with backing from Friends of the Earth – is trying to stop Amazon expanding its footprint in France’s south east. Before dealing with his surgical list that June morning, he stopped by the empty construction site.

The vet, who lives 14 kilometres from the site, said he was concerned about the traffic and pollution an Amazon logistics hub would cause and believed that Amazon promoted a consumerist way of life that was harmful to society.

""How are we going to reduce the pollution when you have a big operation like this, with so many vehicles that are going to be circulating around it?"" he said. He added that he didn’t shop at Amazon.com and was trying – so far unsuccessfully – to persuade his adult son to stop doing so.

Amazon representatives declined to comment on whether the firm was connected to the Lyon site or on the activities of the company’s opponents.

The representatives said the company was good for the environment because its distribution model was more efficient than traditional retail, and therefore involved fewer miles travelled and less pollution. They said the company’s business model complements, rather than destroys, bricks and mortar retail and that it works closely with small French firms who use Amazon’s logistics network. They also said the company generates thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly.

FACING OPPOSITION

France is particularly fertile ground for Amazon sceptics. It is a country that is historically queasy about U.S.-style capitalism, has strong trade unions, and an attachment to the kind of mom-and-pop neighbourhood stores that, in some cases, feel threatened by Amazon.

In addition to legal action, Amazon’s opponents in France are engaging in a range of tactics from direct action that has involved storming the company’s sites and lobbying for legislation to impose a two-year moratorium on distribution sites of the scale that the online retailer operates. France’s new environment minister, Barbara Pompili, last week said she backs a moratorium, without specifying the length.

It’s not the only country where Amazon faces opposition. In Germany, the company’s largest market after the United States, workers at six Amazon sites went on short-term strike over safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the United States, Amazon workers in Michigan, New York, Illinois and Minnesota staged walkouts to demand safer working conditions in the epidemic.

Amazon workers filed a case in June against the online retailer in the U.S district court for the eastern district of New York alleging the firm did not adequately protect workers from COVID-19 at a facility on Staten island, New York. Three of the French unions that were involved in the case in France have also asked the US court if they can take part in the New York case, which is ongoing.

The French ruling “sends a significant message to Amazon workers in the United States and everywhere,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which itself petitioned the court in the New York case to participate on the side of the Amazon workers.

Amazon has said its distribution centres in France, the United States and elsewhere are safe.

On the U.S. case, Lisa Levandowski, Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation.” In a June 30 court filing, Amazon’s lawyers said the plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed because they were “unsupported by any plausible allegations,” among other reasons.

The company does have supporters in France. Christian Poiret, mayor of a district in northern France where Amazon has a distribution centre, said he fought to attract the online retailer in order to generate jobs in the area. He added that he’s concerned about the actions of the anti-Amazon campaigners because of “the image we’re sending to foreign investors.”

An Élysée official said French President Emmanuel Macron’s administration has not changed its policy: “Amazon’s sites have been welcome and are welcome.”

BATTLEGROUND FRANCE

For Amazon, France offers potential for growth. Amazon has an estimated 19% share of the French business-to-consumer e-commerce market, significantly lower than its 42% share in Germany, according to market researcher Forrester Research.

Amazon doesn’t disclose its French revenues but says the country is a smaller market for the company than the UK and Germany.

The company says it has in the past three years doubled the number of people it directly employs in France to 9,300. That is a faster rate than it has increased its workforce in each of the UK and Germany during the same period. And, Amazon plans to open another big distribution centre in northern France in the next few months, a company representative said.

Amazon is also planning to set up a big distribution centre in Metz, near France’s border with Luxembourg, according to Jean-Luc Bohl, who until earlier this month was mayor of Metz Metropolitan area local government. Amazon representatives declined to comment.

The planned project Renevier is seeking to block is for a 160,000-square-metre logistics hub near Lyon airport. Amazon isn’t named in the planning application, which was submitted by the French arm of an Australian-headquartered property developer called Goodman Group that specializes in building logistics hubs.

But Amazon would ultimately operate the site, say campaigners and David Kimelfeld, who until earlier this month was head of the Lyon Metropolitan area local government, a region that is close to the site. Kimelfeld said he had attended meetings with other local officials where Amazon’s involvement with the project was discussed. Reuters was unable to independently confirm discussion of Amazon’s involvement during the meetings.

Goodman France didn’t respond to a request for comment. Parent company Goodman Group said: “Given there is a case before the courts, we are not in a position to make a comment at this time, other than to say there have been two previous rounds of litigation where we were successful both times.”

Renevier’s Fracture and the other local group filed suits in the Lyon administrative tribunal in 2018 and 2019 alleging irregularities in the planning application, including that Goodman is not the ultimate operator of the hub. The tribunal ruled against the groups late last year, a decision Renevier and his allies appealed in January.

SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS

The lawyer representing Renevier’s group in the legal challenge is now being assisted by a lawyer seconded by the Friends of the Earth national headquarters in Paris. Friends of the Earth also campaigned in a municipal election in May against a local mayor who backed the project.

It is part of a broader campaign by the lobby group against Amazon, which it says has created an unsustainable economic model that is harmful for the planet and for humans. Some of the Amazon-related activities of Friends of the Earth are funded indirectly by the European Climate Foundation, which distributes grants on behalf of donors including a Rockefeller family philanthropic fund, Michael Bloomberg, the family foundation of computer mogul William Hewlett and the IKEA founder’s foundation.

ECF’s executive director of strategic communications, Tom Brookes, said the grant was to fund a range of the environmental lobby group’s activities but that the foundation was aware at the time of the award that some money would be used in its Amazon campaign. Brooke added that donors weren’t necessarily aware of where individual grants go.

The lead campaigner on Amazon for the French chapter of Friends of the Earth, Alma Dufour, said most of the ECF’s grant goes towards broader grassroots climate initiatives and the amount spent on targeting Amazon is small. Brooke and Dufour declined to comment on the size of the grant.

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation said it provided general support for ECF for its broad mission on climate change, but not specifically for the Amazon campaign. The IKEA foundation said it had a shared mission with ECF relating to the environment but didn’t address specific questions about Amazon. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies did not respond to requests for comment.

Open Society Foundations, founded and chaired by U.S. billionaire George Soros, said it provided 9,000 euros to the French chapter of Friends of the Earth to support its campaign to protect low-wage and informal workers and small shop owners in the pandemic.

573,2020-07-29T08:15:07+00:00,Indian Tech Moguls Urge Modi To Be Tougher on Chinese Rivals,"(Bloomberg) -- Leaders in India’s technology industry are urging the country to go even further to protect the interests of local companies against foreign rivals, or risk ceding the world’s fastest growing internet arena to Chinese and American monopolies.

Narendra Modi’s administration this month banned 59 Chinese apps in the country, including ByteDance Ltd.’s short-video hit TikTok, a dramatic policy shift aimed at improving local control and data security. In separate interviews, Policybazaar co-founder Yashish Dahiya -- whose company is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- and MobiKwik frontman Bipin Preet Singh urged Modi to go further. Emboldened by growing hostility against its giant neighbor, they want regulators to curb their access to Indian markets, establish rules to wrest back control of user data and bankroll local startups.

“China has long been the bratty kid who thinks it’s OK to grab others’ cake without sharing your own,” Dahiya told Bloomberg News last week. India must strategically reduce market access before its neighbor becomes even more powerful. “If India doesn’t do it now, it can never be done,” said Dahiya, whose online insurance service targets a 2021 IPO at a $3.5 billion value.

Dahiya and Singh are breaking with tradition in an Indian startup sector that over the past half-decade has attracted billions from Chinese companies and investment houses from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Hillhouse Capital. Their stance reflects a shift in sentiment after a mid-June Himalayan border clash left 20 soldiers dead -- but also a wave of techno-nationalism as the coronavirus pummels global economies. It coincides with a surge of interest from American giants like Facebook Inc. and Google as India’s nascent digital economy blossoms.

“It’s not an easy position to take,” said Dahiya, whose Policybazaar is now trying to raise $250 million of pre-IPO financing. “A sovereign nation has no parent but someone’s got to stop China from misbehaving.”

Story continues

On Tuesday, an official with China’s Indian embassy said Beijing will take “necessary measures” to protect the country’s companies from a ban that threatens their legitimate rights, and urged Modi’s government to reverse “wrongdoings.”

Before TikTok overtook YouTube to become India’s most popular social video platform, the dominance of WhatsApp and Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. in e-commerce had already rankled local businesses. Beijing is now the bigger target, as the world polarizes along U.S.-China lines and American-backed local champions such as Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms emerge. The influx of American investment sets up a potential clash with China’s own internet titans in the future -- provided they’re allowed to operate in the country.

That, along with trade barriers erected in just past weeks, may have fired up the entrepreneurs. The government should identify strategic sectors and nurture local startups, MobiKwik’s Singh advocated.

“The China versus U.S. battleground is neither China nor the U.S., but India,” said Singh, whose Sequoia Capital-backed payments startup competes with both Google Pay and Alibaba-backed Paytm.

“If India’s entire 1.3 billion population is served only by foreign companies, how can that be a good thing?” he said in a telephone interview from his base in New Delhi. “Yet India doesn’t have a single technology giant, it’s become a growth engine for global companies. What is India doing wrong?”

India’s unprecedented apps ban thwarted the global ambitions of China’s technology giants just as the spotlight is turning on the world’s largest untapped digital frontier. ByteDance and other targeted companies have since attempted negotiations with New Delhi, but they’ll have to contend with more than mere legal obligations.

India’s roaring digital economy, with half a billion users and growing, is witnessing pitched battles in everything from online retail and content streaming to messaging and digital payments -- but largely between deep-pocketed foreign corporations. That’s coincided with growth tapering off at Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., which put India’s tech sector on the map but are now grappling with a fundamental shift to the cloud.

While India has attracted over $20 billion in just past months from American giants like Google and Facebook, China has over the years carved out a significant role in India’s tech industry, according to Mumbai-based think-tank Gateway House. Eighteen of India’s 30 unicorns are Chinese-funded, researchers Amit Bhandari, Blaise Fernandes and Aashna Agarwal said in a report. Apart from TikTok, smartphone brands like leader Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo have cornered three-quarters of the market. Firms like Qiming Venture Partners nearly doubled Chinese investments in Indian startups to $3.9 billion in 2019, according to the Economic Times.

“I’m not advocating a closed or protectionist environment like China’s, but India needs local champions and also needs to safeguard its data and security,” Singh said. “We need competition, we need choices. But we can’t have a situation where there’s no Indian player in entire segments from search to messaging, social media, ecommerce and payments.”

Modi’s government has already set things in motion. It drafted an e-commerce policy that openly champions aid for local startups and oversight on how foreign companies handle data. A government panel recommended a data regulator to oversee monetization and privacy of user information to ensure “maximum social and economic benefits” for Indians. Local startups are enjoying something of a renaissance: TikTok-a-like Roposo is signing up half a million new users an hour.

But more is needed, Singh said. The system remains stacked against the hundreds of thousands of would-be entrepreneurs who have to take on global behemoths. The government could limit the influence of foreign capital as it has done in sectors like banking, he added.

MobiKwik has “raised $100 million so far and is taking on companies with a collective market value of over $2 trillion,” he said. “We are doing injustice to our entrepreneurs if we stack them against dollars and yuans in every single segment.”

574,2020-07-29T00:20:55+00:00,EBay Boosts Outlook on Pandemic; Investors Ask If It Will Last,"(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc. raised its profit and sales forecasts for the year, but the new outlook disappointed investors who hoped the digital marketplace would take greater advantage of the surge in consumer spending during the pandemic. Shares declined as much as 6% in extended trading.

The market reaction suggested investors are worried the spending bump on EBay could be fleeting as economies reopen and people return to work. A drop in federal stimulus money, which could trigger a pullback in consumer spending, is another concern, analysts said. Spending among EBay’s U.S. customers grew 35% in the second quarter, while international spending increased 22%.

EBay executives said sales increases had moderated in countries such as Italy and Germany where pandemic restrictions are less severe, prompting concerns the company would quickly return to the sluggish revenue growth that has lingered the past several years, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.

The pandemic has boosted online shopping platforms such as EBay and Amazon.com Inc. even though double-digit unemployment has hurt the overall economy. In the second quarter, EBay reported gross merchandise volume, the value of all goods sold on its platforms, increased 26% to $27.1 billion from a year earlier. The company said it added 8 million new active buyers to end the quarter with 182 million. Analysts, however, projected almost 184 million.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone said the company stepped up marketing, which helped it attract tens of thousands of new small businesses looking for ways to reach shoppers when their locations shut down. That helped EBay meet demand for items like masks and hand sanitizer initially and later products including laptops, office furniture and fitness equipment as more people worked from home and gyms closed.

“Investors have a lot of EBay scar tissue,” Forte said. “Let’s give the new CEO a chance to show he can run with a tailwind and sustain growth.”

Story continues

About 80% of the increased gross merchandise volume was generated by existing customers shopping more frequently and spending more on the site, EBay said. The remaining 20% came from new shoppers.

Annual earnings will be $3.47 to $3.59 a share, the San Jose, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $3.50, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue will be as much as $10.75 billion in 2020, the company said. At the end of April, EBay projected annual sales of as much as $9.76 billion. Analysts estimated $10.4 billion.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone said the company stepped up marketing, which helped it attract tens of thousands of new small businesses looking for ways to reach shoppers when their locations shut down. That helped EBay meet demand for items like masks and hand sanitizer initially and later products including laptops, office furniture and fitness equipment as more people worked from home and gyms closed.

EBay has trailed Amazon in recent years and was pressured by activist investors Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value to slim down and focus on its core marketplace. The company in February completed the sale of its event-tickets marketplace StubHub to Viagogo for $4.05 billion. Earlier this month, EBay sold the classifieds business to Norway’s Adevinta ASA in a cash and stock deal worth $9.2 billion that leaves EBay with a 44.4% stake in the company.

Iannone, who took the helm in April following the ouster last year of predecessor Devin Wenig, must show that a refocused EBay can compete with Amazon, which has benefited from a Covid-fueled surge in sales and is scheduled to report earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, Walmart Inc., which has invested heavily in online shopping options, will surpass EBay as America’s No. 2 online marketplace this year, according to EMarketer Inc.

Iannone also inherited a scandal that prompted the firing of six executives indicted for allegedly cyberstalking a couple who published unflattering stories about the company during Wenig’s tenure.

In the second quarter, EBay reported sales gained 18% to $2.87 billion. Analysts, on average, projected $2.8 billion. Earnings, excluding some costs, were $1.08 a share in the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.06.

Shares dropped to a low of $52.48 in extended trading after closing at $56.35 in New York. The stock has gained 56% this year.

576,2020-07-28T07:15:45+00:00,Walmart's Flipkart to offer 90-minute delivery in India,"BENGALURU, July 28 (Reuters) - India's Flipkart said on Tuesday it plans to offer 90-minute deliveries for groceries and home accessories, as the Walmart-owned online retailer goes head to head with Amazon.com Inc in a key growth market for e-commerce.

Flipkart said its hyperlocal service, dubbed Flipkart Quick, will also sell mobile phones and stationery items, taking it a step further than existing quick-delivery services which mainly offer just groceries.

Flipkart Quick will debut in select locations in Bengaluru, the company said, without specifying a launch date.

The new service puts Flipkart more directly in competition with Amazon and Alibaba-backed BigBasket, both of which offer quick deliveries of groceries. Bengaluru-based Flipkart will also go up against grocery delivery upstart JioMart, backed by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani.

Google-backed Dunzo and Naspers-backed Swiggy also offer grocery deliveries in India, and the service could be lucrative for companies during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is making more Indians order essential items such as groceries online.

""Halfway through the year of the pandemic, supply chains have transformed drastically,"" Flipkart said in a statement. ""The hyperlocal category, known for being a convenience for many, has now emerged to be a long-term essential service for the country.""

Last week, Flipkart said it had acquired Walmart's local cash-and-carry business in an effort to strengthen its wholesale offerings to mom-and-pop-stores.

577,2020-07-23T09:06:12+00:00,"Facebook Ad Boycott To Continue, Publicis Predicts As Organic Revenue Drops 13% In Q2","Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) advertising boycott is likely to continue, Publicis Group S.A. (OTC: PGPEF) Chairman Arthur Sadoun said at the backdrop of the company reporting earnings for its second quarter this financial year.

What Happened

Publicis is the world’s third-largest advertising group by sales and its chairman feels that the boycott against Facebook is not subsiding, the Financial Times reported Thursday.

“I don’t see it quietening down because I can see the determination . . . of our clients to make things change,” the executive remarked.

Sadoun noted it was too early to say if the campaign against the social media giant would succeed, saying, “The past does not lead me to be optimistic, but I want to be hopeful for the future.”

Why It Matters

The chairman’s remarks came at a time when Publicis reported a 13% drop in organic revenue globally in the second quarter. It posted net revenue of $2.67 billion in the quarter.

Facebook is the second-largest online ads seller after Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), ahead of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the Financial Times noted.

Spending on Facebook advertising fell 32% in the last two weeks of June, according to figures from Social Bakers, a social media marketing firm.

This week Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) quietly joined the Facebook advertising boycott, alongside Unilever NV (NYSE: UN), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Verizon Communication Inc (NYSE: VZ).

The ad spending cuts at the social media platform are coming at a time when the pandemic has squeezed the revenues of a majority of companies. Market forecaster Magna, owned by The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc (NYSE: IPG), predicts global advertising spending to decline by 12.8% in 2020 to $144 billion, the Financial Times reported.

The two Silicon Valley tech giants that gave him a third of the money will help put him there.

It’s an audacious plan. Politicians in many nations, including the U.S., the U.K. and India, are reluctant to let Huawei Technologies Co., which they accuse of being an instrument of the Chinese state, become embedded in the fast-speed internet networks that will run everything from power stations to autonomous cars.

Ambani’s four-year-old Jio Platforms Ltd. has indigenously built its own 5G technology, the tycoon announced at Wednesday’s annual general meeting of his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. After testing it on the 400 million 4G customers he has in India, he’ll offer it to other markets. The news18.com website, also controlled by Ambani, called the technology a “Huawei-killer,” and noted that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had praised Jio as a clean network for not using the Chinese firm’s gear.

While details of Ambani’s 5G prowess and the markets he hopes to target are still fuzzy, the planned assault against handset makers is clearer. Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai made a virtual appearance at the Reliance AGM and pledged $4.5 billion for a 7.7% stake in Jio and a chance to build an Android operating system. The cheap smartphones running it will migrate 350 million Indians who still use feature phones to mobile internet. But how much customization will Google be comfortable with? If it’s a lot, the phone may be affordable but tied to Jio’s apps. Too little, and the pricing may be unattractive. Somewhere in between those extremes, it’s a threat to Xiaomi Corp. As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai notes, India accounted for 35% of the Chinese vendor’s smartphone shipments last year.

One more thing is now evident: WhatsApp, the messaging system of Facebook Inc., which has given Jio $5.7 billion for a near-10% stake, will drive commerce. The blueprint is again Chinese. Whatsapp’s popularity, and its ability to handle payments in real time, make it a perfect platform for Ambani to build a super-app like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, connecting brands with customers.

The 300,000 Reliance investors who watched the AGM on JioMeet, Ambani’s cloud-conferencing clone of Zoom Video Communications Inc., probably found the sharp pivot away from hydrocarbons a bit too much to take. Ambani dropped enough hints that last year’s plan to sell 20% of his mainstay oils-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco was now unlikely. Given the Covid-19 situation, writing a $15 billion check would be a further strain on Aramco’s $75 billion-a-year dividend payout, as my colleague David Fickling has noted. Still, Reliance shares fell 3.8% after Ambani said the unit will be spun off and seek new investors.

Reliance may get saddled with a permanent discount as a holding company of digital, retail and hydrocarbon assets, but the empire could as easily command a premium as India’s undeclared national champion.

Just as Ambani wants to emulate several successful Chinese firms at once, the country’s policy makers want the same thing for the broader economy: make India the world’s factory, by lodging it into the growing chasm between the West and China. But neither the physical infrastructure, nor most of India Inc.’s balance sheet, is ready. After the pandemic, everything from a broken financial sector to grossly inadequate worker housing, healthcare and social security will compete for fiscal sops from a government trying to retain its tenuous investment-grade rating.

Reliance’s capital-raising spree has made it free of net debt. It’s willing to run with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s buy-Indian agenda. Its grocery business would lift farmer incomes by direct purchasing. Jio’s cheap cloud services for small businesses would help them digitize. By connecting to JioMart, a virtual store, neighborhood shops could outgrow their limited shelf space, Ambani said. JioMeet could become as a virtual classroom to the country. Reliance also wants to supply cleaner auto fuels to end Indian cities’ crippling pollution problem.

As India has learned from China, economic policy that aligns itself with the expansion of a few large capitalists is more manageable — and produces faster results — than one that has to play referee to free and open competition. By the time that throws up a winner, Vietnam and Bangladesh might corner the export opportunity that India wants to claim.

India’s competitive landscape would have been broadened had Google’s Pichai bought a stake in Jio’s telecom competitor Vodafone Idea Ltd., a plan it was considering, according to a Financial Times report in May. Although that deal is probably now dead, Pichai might still pitch his own tent separately from Ambani’s. So far, he’s only decided on the handset partnership with Jio. There’s still plenty left in the $10 billion kitty he set aside for India this week.

There’s also Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos. It will be surprising if, after committing $5.5 billion to the country, he bows out. As for Ambani, he still has to demonstrate that one company can be India’s answer to everything, from Zoom and Tencent to Huawei and Xiaomi, while also being a large telco like Verizon Communications Inc.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: --Sachs, as I had mentioned, out with a good earnings report today. They actually had beat on the both top and bottom lines. That stock right now up just over 1%, so paring some of the gains they had a little bit earlier today.

When you're looking at today, right now, energy, industrials, and financials are all leading today. Tech starting to flip into the green right now. Microsoft still in the red. However, Apple and Facebook-- Facebook a little bit flat right now, but Apple now in the green, up about 3/10 of a percentage point.

And on the coronavirus front, as I just mentioned, Moderna coming out some positive news when it comes to that vaccine. But they're not the only ones. AstraZeneca also announcing that they would be having some good news to share with us on the vaccine front as early potentially as tomorrow. That would be Thursday.

Current case count right now nearing 3.5 million, which means we leapfrogged past that 3.4 million number. If you guys remember yesterday, it was just under 3.4 million. Now steadily approaching that 3.5 million number. New York state, sad news here, has now surpassed 25,000 deaths due to COVID-19. And in Oklahoma, Governor Kevin Stitt says that he has actually tested positive for coronavirus.

Now, as I mentioned, markets had been popping a little bit more earlier today on that positive vaccine news out from Moderna and AstraZeneca. Goldman Sachs, also as I mentioned, out with some positive earnings. So for more on what we're seeing in the markets today, we're joined now by Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab. Thanks for joining us, Jeff.

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Thanks for having me on.

KRISTIN MYERS: So in a recent blog that I had been reading, you had written, quote, in these uncertain times, it may be comforting to know that the markets are making some sense. So where are markets making sense in your mind? And where does the confusion still remain?

Story continues

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, you know, one of the things that's important is the biggest driver for stocks over the long term are earnings. But even in the near term, stocks and the direction of earnings estimates should be lining up. And although we are seeing a bit of an uptick here in the last month or so in earnings estimates, the actual level, the number, it's a guess at this point.

But the fact that we're seeing more analysts raise the-- raise their numbers for companies then cut them is important. And that's something the stock market has been tracking really all year. As analysts were cutting estimates, stocks were falling. And now as we're seeing a larger and larger number of companies seeing upward estimates, stocks have been tracking that.

And that's really important. As we go through the earnings season here, I think we're going to see more of this. You're going to hear more of these results, exceeding expectations. About 80% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far-- I know it's early-- but they have exceeded expectations.

And what we've seen in recent business surveys around the world-- Australia, France, Germany, the US-- is an uptick in business leader confidence. And that may translate into better guidance and the continuation of this trend of upward earnings estimates. So that's a positive for the markets.

Where I'm seeing a disconnect, just to jump to that, is in the expectations for dividends. The financial sector is a great example. We got some results this morning. We'll get more this week.

Analysts are more optimistic on the return of dividends later this year, both for US and international financial services companies. Not true in the markets. If we look at dividend futures, markets are still expecting those dividends to basically remain at the levels they are now post-COVID all through next year.

So there's a potential there for an upward revision to dividend expectations, which could provide further upside to the financial sector, one of the areas leading today.

KRISTIN MYERS: So Jeffrey, I want to ask you about that guidance point, especially as we're looking out a little bit further into Q3, Q4, and even into 2021. As you're mentioning, analysts really downbeat on this quarter when it comes to earnings. Do you see a revision in the future, more optimism there, raising the bar that some of these companies are going to have to beat in future earning-- future earnings reports for coming quarters?

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Yeah, it's true that the bar may go up a little bit here. And companies-- yeah, it's a little bit harder. But look, the market's hardly raised that bar. We've seen such a rebound in the stock market. We need to see that follow through in terms of earnings expectations to support these valuations.

Yeah, down the road, third quarter, fourth quarter, companies are going to come up on those hurdles that may be a bit higher. And they're going to have to clear them. And so that could be a challenge down the road and lead to more of-- maybe more volatility in the markets later this year.

But for now, to support this upside move, we continue to see these upward revisions. So in the near term, that's good news. It does create a higher hurdle down the road.

KRISTIN MYERS: So on the vaccine front, as I had been mentioning, we got some positive news out from Moderna, AstraZeneca. We've heard a lot of positive news from Gilead, BioNTech, Regeneron. The list kind of seems to be going on.

And I feel like we're in this environment that we were in before when it came to the US-China trade deal. It almost feels as if we are in this binary moment, a will they, won't they when it comes to the vaccine. So, I mean, how do investors manage on just trading on whether we are going to get a vaccine or we are not going to be getting a vaccine?

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Right, there will certainly be a big difference. A vaccine is an important accelerator of economic activity. So it's understandable the market's reacting in such a bifurcated way, I mean, especially where the number of cases continue to climb, like in the US and in Brazil and in India.

It would also be a welcome relief for lagging industries, like the airlines and hotels and restaurants. We're still seeing pretty soft things like weekend box office revenue. Even though movie theaters are now open in much of Europe and Asia, even where the virus has been defeated, like Japan or Korea or France, people aren't really returning to movie theaters or flying on airplanes, for example. So a vaccine could see a sharper service sector recovery and really lift the stocks in some of those areas.

But the good news is a recovery is still underway, even without a vaccine. And this is what investors should focus on. Business surveys, as I mentioned, in the past week in France, in Germany, Australia, other places, do reflect the V-shaped recovery in at least business leader confidence. And that's important as we look to the future for the labor market, which is so critical to our consumer-driven economy.

KRISTIN MYERS: So I want to ask you about tech right now. As I mentioned, tech wasn't doing so well today, although we have now seen some bigger FAANG stocks flipping into the green. Now anyone that read the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief-- I want to give a shout out there to Myles Udland and Sam Ro-- they were talking about investor worries about betting big on tech.

So I'm wondering, Jeffrey, in your mind, how much risk is there in the high weighting of tech stocks right now? And in the brief, I kind of want to quote here that they noted a net 42% of investors are overweight technology stocks, the highest of any sector.

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: It's easy to let your portfolio drift into that position. I do think that's a risk. We are not overweight the technology sector. We were for many, many, many years. And we have taken that down.

We're now overweight financials. Here's an area where probably most investors are underweight in their portfolio. After many years of disappointing performance, we think there's a rotation taking place from growth to value. And we're seeing this show up even in day like today, where again, financials are outperforming the tech sector and they have for the last couple of months.

This is not just a theme in the near term. We think it will unfold through this entire economic cycle. So it's important for investors to get ahead of this and rebalance their portfolios back to a more balanced representation across growth sectors, like tech, and value ones, like financials.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, we'll have to leave that there.

* Online shopping surges as consumers stay home

* Retailers add capacity to meet demand

By Nqobile Dludla

JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Reuters) - Like many of her compatriots, Kubashnee Moodley made her first foray into online shopping during South Africa's coronavirus lockdown. She is not a satisfied customer.

The 42-year-old business management coach was once charged for a parcel she never received and also had groceries delivered to her Johannesburg home after dark. ""I was not going to risk going to the gate ... especially with crime so high,"" she said.

Moodley's experience encapsulates the challenging situation facing the e-commerce sector in Africa's most advanced economy.

Having long lagged behind much of the world in terms of e-commerce, South African retailers and delivery start-ups have been doing a roaring trade online as consumers shy away from shops during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the likes of Pick n Pay , Checkers and OneDayOnly experiencing an explosion in demand.

But this post-COVID boom is straining the capacity of even the largest retailers, leaving some customers complaining of long wait times and poor service.

The ability to alleviate those growing pains will dictate which companies emerge as e-commerce leaders and which will be left behind.

Factors such as fear of parcel theft, online fraud and high mobile data costs have long hindered South African e-commerce growth, experts say.

Global e-commerce leviathan Amazon does not operate in the economy of 58 million consumers, partly because of the cost and challenges of setting up the required infrastructure, analysts say. And African giant Jumia only launched in South Africa this year.

Amazon, the vast majority of whose customers have to rely on cross-border shopping at its 16 websites around the world, declined to comment.

ONLINE LAGGARD

E-commerce accounted for only 1.6%, or $1.2 billion, of South African retail sales in 2019, according to London-based market research firm Euromonitor International. In the United States, the figure is 14.8%. Even Kenya shops more online than its larger neighbour.

Story continues

However, Euromonitor expects sales to double this year while Nielsen South Africa's retail lead analyst Gareth Paterson predicts up to 200% growth in online food purchases.

A survey conducted by Visa found that 64% of consumers in South Africa bought groceries online for the first time because of the coronavirus outbreak and that 53% made their first online purchase from a pharmacy.

When lockdown restrictions imposed in late March were loosened in May, market researcher Urban Studies found that only 50-70% of customers returned to shopping centres.

""This was the quantum shift,"" said Anthony Thunstrom, chief executive of clothing and homeware retailer TFG. ""We probably advanced two to three years in terms of online demand because of COVID-19.""

Nikki Lincoln, a 34-year-old communications specialist, thought shopping online would spare her the ""unnecessary risk"" of going out during the pandemic.

""Woolworths has closed off online deliveries for my area, so I can't shop there at all. And Pick n Pay has such a long waiting time you might as well just go to the shop,"" she said, naming two of South Africa's leading supermarket chains.

CAPACITY BOOST

Woolworths said that home delivery suspensions were temporary, resulting from an employee testing positive for the virus, but acknowledged that increased demand had caused delays.

In April it launched a drive-through click-and-collect service, boosting its online capacity by 50%.

When the lockdown began, Pick n Pay partnered with Bottles, an alcohol delivery app that expanded into groceries with the promise of same-day service.

""Our enhancements last year to create a stronger online operation ... enabled us to expand our offer in response to the demand for online shopping. Our team rapidly increased its capacity and reach and met the needs of many new customers,"" Jessica Knight, head of online at Pick n Pay, said without commenting specifically on delays.

Sixty60 - a grocery delivery app run by Shoprite's Checkers supermarkets - backed away from hourly dispatching, opting instead for same-day delivery. It is now expanding its delivery area weekly.

Companies hoping to compete, therefore, are quickly pumping money into their e-commerce offerings even as they feel the pain of a pandemic-induced economic downturn.

Grocery delivery business Zulzi was forced to limit trading to two hours a day for two weeks after shoppers overwhelmed its app, but it has since quadrupled the number of shoppers and drivers it employs and doubled its customer care staff.

It is now processing 2,000 orders a day - five times 2019 levels - and has done a year's worth of turnover in the past two months.

TFG, the brands of which include @home, Foschini and Markham, plans to raise 3.95 billion rand ($234.2 million) this month, partly to bolster its e-commerce business.

Grocery delivery business Zulzi was forced to limit trading to two hours a day for two weeks after shoppers overwhelmed its app, but it has since quadrupled the number of shoppers and drivers it employs and doubled its customer care staff.

It is now processing 2,000 orders a day - five times 2019 levels - and has done a year's worth of turnover in the past two months.

TFG, the brands of which include @home, Foschini and Markham, plans to raise 3.95 billion rand ($234.2 million) this month, partly to bolster its e-commerce business.

585,2020-07-14T05:47:25+00:00,India's Digital Future Means a Google Search,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a long time, U.S.-based internet giants entertained the idea of finally accessing the world’s biggest market and tapping into a base of more than 1.3 billion potential consumers. Now, just as the door to China appears firmly shut, the next giant market is opening up.

Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai is ready to realize India’s potential with the one way executives know best: a big fat check. The American search-engine giant said its Google unit plans to spend $10 billion over the next seven years on operations, infrastructure and investments as a “reflection of our confidence in the future of India and its digital economy.”

American corporate leaders from Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos to Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg have all known that India could be the next big thing. Pichai, himself Indian-born, hasn’t sat idly by, either.

Their entry has been slowed by lack of broad-based demand for services offered only in English, a national market fragmented by whimsical local taxation, and an inadequate road and warehousing network that would facilitate quick e-commerce logistics.Favorable Chinese treatment, and protectionism, allowed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to develop super-apps that deliver a smorgasbord of offerings from instant messaging to news and deliveries to financial services. No U.S. giant offers anywhere near the breadth and depth of services as their Chinese counterparts.

Indian oil billionaire Mukesh Ambani has designs on doing in his home country just what the Americans couldn’t do in theirs.

Four years ago, he upended the telecommunications sector with a new entrant that offered free voice calls and really cheap data. Suddenly, hundreds of millions more Indian consumers had a mobile phone in their hands and a reliable, affordable internet connection. Ambani followed that up by getting Facebook to buy a 10% percent stake in Jio Platforms Ltd. — Ambani’s holding company for telcos, media and other digital assets — for $5.7 billion.

Story continues

With Facebook now owning a stake in Jio, it makes sense for Google to look for its own telco dance partner, be it Bharti Airtel Ltd. or Vodafone Idea Ltd. — the only two meaningful competitors to Jio’s wireless service that are still left in the fray.

Google’s big move is well-timed. The nation’s largely state-owned banking system was in bad shape even before Covid-19. After the inevitable pandemic-linked losses, institutions will be grateful to limp again and digital commerce will present a new growth avenue. When Indian consumers need loans, they’ll be giving consent to lenders to digitally piece together their credit history by pulling scraps from everywhere. Suppliers of goods and services will also want to tap cheaper working capital by sharing a real-time snapshot of their cash flows.

Indian banks are at a disadvantage in the coming shakeup. Information collection, analysis and distribution is exactly what the U.S. internet companies do best. Jio with Facebook, Google (with or without a chosen partner), and even Amazon.com could have deeper insights into consumer and supplier habits than the traditional financiers. A Jio or Google-backed finance app could dish out a loan faster than a banker could pull out a ballpoint pen. That would leave the state-owned lenders offering little more than their vast balance sheets for credit creation.

Not only is India finally getting the fast mobile coverage it sorely needs, its payments infrastructure is also ready. Pichai has built a payments service specifically for India, using the local platform that allows any two parties, holding accounts at different banks, to send and receive money instantly without knowing anything more than each others’ virtual IDs. The revamped network is so modern and innovation-friendly that Google has asked the U.S. to consider emulating it.

Jio has garnered much of the recent attention, helped by a splashy fundraising spectacle that adds up to half of the investment in global telecom deals this year. But Google’s payment app as well as WalMart’s PhonePe have been quietly scaling up. Now, when Indian consumers want deliveries, entertainment, or a loan there’s a good chance they’ll be searching Google.

587,2020-07-10T02:43:07+00:00,INSIGHT-A space odyssey: Britain rockets into unknown with OneWeb,"(Updates Airbus response)

By Sam Nussey

TOKYO, July 9 (Reuters) - Britain is betting that satellite operator OneWeb will help it boldly go into a post-Brexit era. But it faces formidable challenges to complete a working constellation and rebuild a collapsed venture that has proved a money pit for investors.

The British government and Indian telecoms conglomerate Bharti Enterprises said last week they would together put up $1 billion to buy OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy after its biggest backer, SoftBank Group, declined to provide fresh funding.

The deal offers a new lease of life for the venture, which was founded by U.S. entrepreneur Greg Wyler with the vision of providing ""internet everywhere for everyone"" via 648 low Earth orbit satellites.

OneWeb, which began as WorldVu in 2012, has 74 satellites already in orbit, as it ramped up launches immediately before collapsing in late March.

Britain is looking at adding positioning technology to new satellites to complement and add resilience to the American GPS system, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, after the country exited the EU's Galileo network as a result of Brexit.

That secondary payload could be built in Britain, the sources said. The idea of providing internet services for remote regions is also attractive to the government.

Additional investment, potentially running to more than $1 billion - on top of the $1 billion British/Bharti commitment - would be needed to complete a constellation that can offer continuous service worldwide, the sources said.

The satellites, which have a lifespan of about five years and are assembled in a highly automated factory run with Airbus , cost in the region of $1 million each, the sources said.

The rocket launches have run to around $70 million apiece, the sources said, carrying 34 satellites into orbit each time.

With a smaller number of launches pushing the number of satellites towards 200, OneWeb could begin providing coverage at the poles, with the military and oil and gas industry seen as potential customers in the Arctic, according to the sources.

Story continues

The British government declined to comment beyond its July 3 statement https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-to-acquire-cutting-edge-satellite-network announcing the deal. Bharti also declined to comment beyond its statement https://www.bharti.com/press-release-2020-2021-uk-government-consortium-led-by-bharti-wins-bid-for-oneweb.html then.

OneWeb declined to comment.

""Getting the future commercialization right for OneWeb will be absolutely key,"" said Campbell Macfarlane, former president of OneWeb's enterprise division who left following the bankruptcy. He said it could prove ""a very shrewd investment for the UK government"".

OneWeb has secured radio spectrum and regulatory approvals needed to operate its satellites and ground infrastructure and offer services around the world, documents filed with a bankruptcy court in New York show.

""This is the best beachfront property there ever was in space,"" one of the sources said of the spectrum.

""OneWeb's birthing is going to be enormously painful, but in the long run it can be very valuable.""

GRAND VISION

Providing universal internet service via satellite has been a dream of numerous tech tycoons and companies over the years, including a failed Bill Gates-backed venture called Teledesic in the 1990s.

Wyler originally brought his idea for what would become OneWeb to Google in 2013. Only a year later, he left Google to team up with Elon Musk's SpaceX.

That partnership ended too and OneWeb went it alone.

Musk and SpaceX are now building a rival constellation, Starlink, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is also developing a space internet business - Project Kuiper.

OneWeb's parade of influential backers included Qualcomm , Airbus, Virgin Group and eventually Japanese investor SoftBank, which pumped roughly $2 billion into the effort.

Wyler formed a tight bond with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who feted him on-stage in Tokyo in 2017 as part of his broader vision, with OneWeb aligning with SoftBank's corporate philosophy of ""information revolution - happiness for everyone"".

However the economics of universal internet service were daunting: it would be hard to charge consumers enough to defray the cost of launching and operating the satellites.

OneWeb was forced to step back from this grand idea and instead focus on a commercial customer base for such services, like airlines and cruise lines, willing to pay a premium.

The venture was hampered by costly contracts involving its own investors, four sources said.

In 2015 it signed a long launch contract with Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus and Safran, locking in prices even as SpaceX was shaking up market pricing in the industry.

Arianespace declined to comment. Airbus declined to comment beyond its July 3 statement welcoming the British government's backing for the project as positive for the country's space industry.

Wyler himself was sidelined from day-to-day management as business pressures mounted, and the company cycled through three CEOs.

Wyler did not respond to a request for comment.

SoftBank was facing its own hard reckoning: a disastrous investment in office-sharing startup WeWork was cooling investor attitudes to money-losing ventures.

The coronavirus outbreak further undermined the business model of many of its biggest investments and hammered OneWeb's biggest potential customers.

With SoftBank's share price tumbling, the conglomerate pulled out of funding talks, collapsing the venture.

SoftBank declined to comment.

HOLLOWED OUT

The acquisition of OneWeb, which is British and U.S.-based, is subject to approval from regulators including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Its new owners will need to rebuild the company's workforce after 90% of its staff were let go following the Chapter 11 filing.

Former OneWeb engineers that helped build and run the system have been hired by rival companies as competition for talent in the space industry heats up. A commercial team - vital if the company is to effectively sell its capacity and achieve profitability - will also need to be reconstituted.

It was unclear if Chief Executive Adrian Steckel, who the bankruptcy filings show was paid a $2.25 million retention payment on March 25, two days before OneWeb filed for Chapter 11, and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Whayne, who was paid $1 million on the same day, will continue to run the company after a takeover.

Steckel and Whayne did not respond to requests for comment.

OneWeb's parade of influential backers included Qualcomm , Airbus, Virgin Group and eventually Japanese investor SoftBank, which pumped roughly $2 billion into the effort.

Wyler formed a tight bond with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who feted him on-stage in Tokyo in 2017 as part of his broader vision, with OneWeb aligning with SoftBank's corporate philosophy of ""information revolution - happiness for everyone"".

However the economics of universal internet service were daunting: it would be hard to charge consumers enough to defray the cost of launching and operating the satellites.

OneWeb was forced to step back from this grand idea and instead focus on a commercial customer base for such services, like airlines and cruise lines, willing to pay a premium.

The venture was hampered by costly contracts involving its own investors, four sources said.

In 2015 it signed a long launch contract with Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus and Safran, locking in prices even as SpaceX was shaking up market pricing in the industry.

Arianespace declined to comment. Airbus declined to comment beyond its July 3 statement welcoming the British government's backing for the project as positive for the country's space industry.

Wyler himself was sidelined from day-to-day management as business pressures mounted, and the company cycled through three CEOs.

Wyler did not respond to a request for comment.

SoftBank was facing its own hard reckoning: a disastrous investment in office-sharing startup WeWork was cooling investor attitudes to money-losing ventures.

The coronavirus outbreak further undermined the business model of many of its biggest investments and hammered OneWeb's biggest potential customers.

With SoftBank's share price tumbling, the conglomerate pulled out of funding talks, collapsing the venture.

SoftBank declined to comment.

HOLLOWED OUT

The acquisition of OneWeb, which is British and U.S.-based, is subject to approval from regulators including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Its new owners will need to rebuild the company's workforce after 90% of its staff were let go following the Chapter 11 filing.

Former OneWeb engineers that helped build and run the system have been hired by rival companies as competition for talent in the space industry heats up. A commercial team - vital if the company is to effectively sell its capacity and achieve profitability - will also need to be reconstituted.

It was unclear if Chief Executive Adrian Steckel, who the bankruptcy filings show was paid a $2.25 million retention payment on March 25, two days before OneWeb filed for Chapter 11, and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Whayne, who was paid $1 million on the same day, will continue to run the company after a takeover.

Steckel and Whayne did not respond to requests for comment.

589,2020-07-08T13:18:18+00:00,How Fast Is Too Fast Where Fashion Is Concerned?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Fast-fashion trailblazer Boohoo Group Plc is being forced to slow down.

Retailers including Amazon.com Plc, Next Plc and Asos Plc are dropping Boohoo products after a Sunday Times article alleged unfair working conditions in its U.K. manufacturing chain in Leicester, England. The company came under criticism from social influencers including former reality TV star Vas J Morgan and model Jayde Pierce. #Boycottboohoo has been trending on Twitter.

After losing 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in market value this week, Boohoo said on Wednesday it’s launching an independent review of its supply chain led by Alison Levitt, a lawyer and former public prosecutor. It also cut ties with two suppliers that infringed on its code of conduct, but said there were inaccuracies in the newspaper report.

Even though the investigation will not be completed for some time, the fast-growing company, founded in 2006 to make cheap, catwalk-inspired fashions for young shoppers, is right to take action.

Boohoo will bolster its board by appointing two more independent non-executive directors with backgrounds in environmental, social and governance issues. It is essential that it makes quality hires. But it should go further. Co-founder Mahmud Kamani remains executive chairman. If the company is serious about putting itself on a surer footing, it should appoint a strong, independent chairman.

One option would be to elevate Brian Small, the former finance director of JD Sports Fashion Plc, who is currently Boohoo’s deputy chairman and senior independent director.

Part of Boohoo’s problem is that it has been growing at breakneck speed and hoovering up rival high-street brands. As sales fly, suppliers struggle to keep up, and so they subcontract to other companies, further removed from the retailer. This is what appears to have happened in this case highlighted by the Sunday Times, according to Boohoo’s investigations into the report.

Story continues

Boohoo is now taking steps to crack down on this practice, refusing to place orders with big suppliers unless they disclose subcontractors and allow them to be audited.

Boohoo’s new chief executive officer, John Lyttle, has experience tackling this kind of situation. He was formerly chief operating officer at Associated British Foods Plc’s Primark, which has dealt with its own supply chain issues in the past. Even so, there will be costs associated with scrutinizing and overhauling the manufacturing base, and they may ultimately have to be passed onto Boohoo’s customers.

The company will invest 10 million pounds to eradicate supply chain malpractice. But it’s not clear what will be found in the independent review. If there are shortcomings, they must be dealt with, at the requisite cost.

Boohoo, whose cheap, dressy clothes are often discarded once they’ve appeared in enough selfies, is particularly vulnerable to environmental, and now social, criticism. Sports Direct saw its sales slow after allegations in 2015 about poor conditions in its distribution center in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Although Boohoo no longer supplies Amazon directly, the U.S. online retailer still holds stock from Boohoo and its associated brands from previous agreements. It will be suspending these products as well as any offered by third-party sellers while Boohoo conducts its investigation.

While many young people say they are concerned about the environment and working conditions, it’s not clear how many Boohoo customers will care enough to stop buying its puff-sleeve blouses and very short denim shorts. They may care more about increases in price however, particularly if they have been furloughed because of the coronavirus lockdown or risk losing their jobs altogether in the health crisis’s aftermath.

So Boohoo has many challenges ahead. It will have to balance a potentially higher cost base with its low prices, while working to integrate recent acquisitions and manage a growth rate that is still likely to be superior to rivals.

That is even more reason why a strong independent chairman must be recruited without delay.

590,2020-07-07T08:00:33+00:00,Wirecard Flourished in Regulatory Blind Spot That’s Growing,"(Bloomberg) -- Wirecard AG’s collapse displayed a growing blind spot for the guardians of the world’s financial system: how do you regulate a firm that acts like bank, but isn’t really a bank?

For years, Germany’s supposed fintech star escaped strict scrutiny because financial watchdog BaFin was focused on its banking unit rather than Wirecard as a whole. With the scandal undermining Germany’s reputation as a place to do business, the government is overhauling who regulates who, but it could also spark a regulatory rethink with consequences for the broader fintech industry.

As banks retrenched after the 2008 financial crisis and spent billions on settling the resulting litigation, rather than new technology, other companies stepped in. Wirecard and competitors like Adyen NV process payments far quicker than traditional banks while also offering clients services to manage their risk and learn more about their own customers. Technology giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. are also increasingly offering financial services.

Swathes of the fintech sector are currently unsupervised, particularly in the area of cryptocurrencies. Around 31% of fintech firms in Europe are not subject to any regulation, according to the European Banking Authority.

“We need regulation that addresses banks and non-banks on a level playing field,” says Benoit Coeure, head of innovation at the Bank for International Settlements, better known as the central bank for central banks. Fintech companies play an important role in wider financial markets and not just in payments, he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Nejra Cehic on Friday.

At issue is whether fintechs and other digital payments firms should be subject to the same type of strict regulation as the banks and financial companies they are trying to disrupt. There are already some regulatory overlaps in many cases but some experts say more gaps need to be covered to ensure the digital companies are supervised as financial firms.

Story continues

In Europe, a company crosses the line into finance and all the regulatory scrutiny that entails when more than 50% of its business is associated with financial activities like lending and taking deposits, according to the EBA. Banks have faced tougher reporting and compliance obligations since the financial crisis.

Wirecard wasn’t classified as a finance company in previous assessments by BaFin and other institutions. While its German bank and its U.K. unit were supervised by local regulators, oversight of the group company was essentially limited to whether it met the disclosure obligations of a German listed company, watched over by BaFin.

BaFin President Felix Hufeld has described the collapse of Wirecard as a “massive fraud.” But for some, the debate about changing or increasing regulation is a distraction from the failure by authorities like BaFin to enforce existing rules.

A Wirecard spokeswoman declined to comment on Hufeld’s characterization.

“The real issue is that BaFin didn’t use the powers they had already,” said Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament for the Green party. “This is negligence by the supervisor, so this doesn’t need a new approach to financial regulation of fintechs.”

While classifying Wirecard as a financial company would have given BaFin more access, the regulator was already able to pursue red flags at Wirecard. BaFin received documents alleging irregularities at the company in January 2019 and asked Germany’s accounting watchdog to look into it. Yet that group failed to deliver a report before Wirecard itself disclosed the 1.9 billion euros of missing cash in June this year. BaFin has also been faulted for moving too slowly.

Hufeld has acknowledged that BaFin is among institutions that fell short in the supervision of Wirecard and has pledged to review any failings. Germany’s Justice Ministry canceled its contract with the accounting enforcement watchdog, known as FREP, while the Finance Ministry has said investigative powers should be handed to BaFin.

To get a license to process payments, companies like Wirecard need to provide documentation on governance to national regulators and are required to keep their customer funds separate from their own revenues. Management also need to be screened by regulators and the banking arms need to maintain a certain level of financial strength.

“The regulatory framework that’s there is fit for purpose,” said John Ahern, a partner at law firm Covington & Burling, who advises clients on financial regulation. “The question is whether the supervision of regulated entities is sufficiently effective.”

Hufeld said he has been pressing the issue of oversight over technology companies for two years, but that ultimately it’s a political decision. Germany took over the rotating presidency of the European Union this month, meaning it could press for changes, although it may be more focused on the response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Wirecard exposed a failure in oversight both by accountants and regulators, but Europe’s regulatory structure also contains gaps which will be more in focus as electronic payments grow, says Huw van Steenis, senior adviser to the CEO at UBS Group AG.

“Europe has been so keen to drive open the payments market to break the banks’ monopoly that the regulatory change has meant that payments firms fall between the cracks,” he said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “Addressing this payments regulatory gap is going to be ever more important in the post-pandemic economy.”

591,2020-07-06T22:00:26+00:00,Can Investors Woo Bolsonaro to Save the Amazon?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors with more than $4.5 trillion in assets want Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to stop loosening environmental rules and do more to control escalating deforestation in the Amazon and beyond. This may be their moment. Upcoming virtual discussions are well-timed: Faced with a pandemic-shattered economy and record outflows, the populist government that has brushed off foreign donors as interfering busybodies will find it harder to ignore sovereign bond holders and equity owners. They can help their case with a show of support for extra green incentives, like biodiversity and carbon credits.

Big funds are becoming increasingly outspoken with governments, and not for pure altruism. It’s clear that poor management of Brazil’s natural wealth — most immediately with a proposed law that will legalize land grabs — is a symptom of deeper dysfunctions that manifest themselves in other areas, too, directly increasing risks for investors. Bolsonaro has failed to take the coronavirus seriously and garbled official guidance. Having parted company with two health ministers since April, Brazil has the second-highest number of cases after the United States.

Brazil had previously done well in combatting deforestation, but the rate has worsened significantly under Bolsonaro. Last month, at the start of the dry season when farmers and loggers seek to clear ground, the number of fires rose to a 13-year high, according to the National Institute for Space Research. That will lift carbon emissions this year, even as the rest of the world sees a drop in climate-warming gases. Earlier in the year, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was caught on camera suggesting that the government use the pandemic to push through more deregulation.The 32 major investors, led by Norway’s Storebrand ASA, said in a letter sent to Brazilian embassies last month that all of this increases “reputational, operation and regulatory risks.”The question of how the wider world convinces emerging economies to put global environmental priorities first has never been easy to answer. Concepts like payment for ecosystem services — compensating governments for forgoing the immediate benefits of land clearance — are helpful, but have often been resisted. Norway, which has paid $1.2 billion into the Amazon Fund under just such a program, suspended payments last year after Bolsonaro’s government, suspicious of non-governmental organizations, questioned the organization and closed the committee that selected projects. Investors have a louder voice than most, not least because Covid-19-era Brazil has little choice but to listen. Public debt is edging toward 100% of gross domestic product, the budget gap has ballooned and the currency has performed dismally of late. The economy could shrink more than 9% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Story continues

Yet how do fund managers turn talks with ministers into actually bringing change? Engaging with a government, be it South Korea or Brazil, is less straightforward than lobbying a company, where enough unsatisfied shareholders can ultimately spill the board.

Raising awareness and highlighting concerns publicly as a group, as investors have done, is one step, coming when Brasilia is more sensitive to outside perceptions. Funds can afford to be specific in their demands, making it easier for both sides to measure success.

There’s always the threat of divestment, most effective when made with the promise of reinvestment if behavior improves — a stick with a carrot attached. Done coherently, that can mean not just selling out of government bonds or shares in locally listed firms, but dumping shares in companies like beef producers and others with unsustainable Brazilian supply chains, widening eventual sources of pressure on the government. In one of the more creative examples, a green bond issued by Norway’s Grieg Seafood ASA last month explicitly promised the cash would not be used to buy feed from trader Cargill Inc. due to “soy-related deforestation risk.” Investors cannot dictate government action, but they can point to portfolio risk and cause plenty of direct and indirect pain.

A few more carrots might help, though, in dealing with a government that has responded better to investment arguments than to moral ones. Options could include support from major investment firms to develop means of monetizing Brazil’s natural wealth by, say, the sale of carbon credits, as the head of wood-pulp producer Suzano SA pointed out last week, or biodiversity credits, increasingly in demand as firms scramble to offset emissions. Salles has estimated $120 per hectare would be necessary annually to protect the Amazon — a small price to pay given the region has the capacity to absorb as much as 5% of the world’s carbon emissions.

Policy makers can provide backup for investor-led efforts at a time when a free trade deal agreed between the European Union and Mercosur, South America’s commercial block, has already met resistance. Real change in Brazil cannot happen without the agricultural sector lobbying for conservation. Bard Harstad, who works on environmental economics at the University of Oslo, says that will happen when producers anticipate that market access is under threat. Withholding the ratification of the agreement until conservation measures are re-introduced, or writing in credible conservation as a condition, would make the message plain.

In the simple terms populists like: Money talks.

593,2020-07-03T09:45:42+00:00,Tesla's Overexcited Fans Should Cool Down a Little,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Back when Tesla Inc. delivered 95,000 cars to customers during the spring quarter of 2019, the stock price was languishing at about $235 and Elon Musk’s electric car company was valued at “only” $40 billion. Fast forward a year and the shares are now priced at more than $1,200. With a market capitalization of $224 billion, Tesla has surpassed Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s most valuable automaker.

Yet in the second quarter of 2020, Tesla delivered 91,000 vehicles — about 5% fewer than the same period last year. That’s pretty underwhelming for a company whose fans view it as a fast-growing technology company in the mold of Amazon.com Inc., rather than a sluggish metal-bashing carmaker. So how is the massive recent jump in its market value justified?

In fairness, it shows resilience to sell this many cars when the company’s main California plant was shut by the pandemic for much of the spring period. Doubtless, Tesla’s new Shanghai plant picked up the production slack, which suggests the expense and effort of getting that China factory up and running was worth it. The launch of Tesla’s new Model Y crossover vehicle will have helped. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. both saw their U.S. deliveries decline by a third in the same quarter.

Nevertheless, Tesla’s stock market acolytes pushed the shares up another 8% on Thursday, adding $16.5 billion to the market value. Such exuberance is hard to understand. Musk’s company sold 7,650 more vehicles than analysts expected during the second quarter, and the stock price jump equates to about $2 million of added shareholder value for each of those additional sales. This seems a little excessive given that a Tesla Model 3 sells for less than $40,000, and the profit margin on those cars is pretty slim.

The shareholder reaction makes even less sense when you consider that Tesla investors aren’t really meant to buying the stock because of the company’s current sales, which are less than 4% of Volkswagen AG’s. Rather, the investment case is a long-term one: that it will come to occupy a dominant position in clean transport and energy in the years ahead. That explains why the shares trade at 320 times its analyst-estimated earnings this year. Viewed through this lens, Tesla’s ability to shift a few thousand extra cars in recent weeks shouldn’t matter so much for the valuation.

Story continues

Investors’ tendency to overreact to Tesla news made more sense when its survival was open to doubt. A year ago it was laying off workers, U.S. sales were slowing and its retail strategy was confused. Senior staff kept heading for the exit. The company was burning through cash and ran pretty low on financial fuel. It had just $2.2 billion of cash in March 2019, compared with more than $8 billion now.

But subsequent evidence that Tesla can sell cars for more than it costs to produce them has transformed the mood — and with it Tesla’s stock price.

Instead of “killing” off Tesla, the tepid electric offerings of established carmakers such as Audi and Mercedes have only underscored the quality of their rival’s battery and powertrain technology (the same can’t be said of Tesla’s build quality). Volkswagen’s software problems with its forthcoming ID.3 electric vehicle suggest catching Tesla won’t be straightforward, even with the Germans’ vast resources.

Tesla’s stratospheric valuation appears to have become self-reinforcing. Should it require more money to fund its roughly $9 billion of capital expenditure over the next three years, it can raise it from shareholders without worrying about diluting them too much.

Similarly, holders of more than $4 billion of convertible bonds that Tesla issued to fund its expansion should be happy to convert them into stock, rather than demand cash repayment, taking some of the pressure off the company and its balance sheet.

Still, Tesla’s valuation remains impossible to justify by any standard metrics. Analysts’ average price target is more than 40% below the current level. Even Musk has suggested that the share price, which has almost trebled since the start of 2020, is too high — although, as with his taunting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and his comments about “fascist” lockdowns, it’s usually better to tune out what Musk says and focus on his actions instead.

The skeptics might have more faith in Tesla’s new position as the leader of the automaker pack when Musk stops his provocations and his shareholders stop getting giddy over modest good news.

Rather, the investment case is a long-term one: that it will come to occupy a dominant position in clean transport and energy in the years ahead. That explains why the shares trade at 320 times its analyst-estimated earnings this year. Viewed through this lens, Tesla’s ability to shift a few thousand extra cars in recent weeks shouldn’t matter so much for the valuation.

Investors’ tendency to overreact to Tesla news made more sense when its survival was open to doubt. A year ago it was laying off workers, U.S. sales were slowing and its retail strategy was confused. Senior staff kept heading for the exit. The company was burning through cash and ran pretty low on financial fuel. It had just $2.2 billion of cash in March 2019, compared with more than $8 billion now.

But subsequent evidence that Tesla can sell cars for more than it costs to produce them has transformed the mood — and with it Tesla’s stock price.

Instead of “killing” off Tesla, the tepid electric offerings of established carmakers such as Audi and Mercedes have only underscored the quality of their rival’s battery and powertrain technology (the same can’t be said of Tesla’s build quality). Volkswagen’s software problems with its forthcoming ID.3 electric vehicle suggest catching Tesla won’t be straightforward, even with the Germans’ vast resources.

Tesla’s stratospheric valuation appears to have become self-reinforcing. Should it require more money to fund its roughly $9 billion of capital expenditure over the next three years, it can raise it from shareholders without worrying about diluting them too much.

Similarly, holders of more than $4 billion of convertible bonds that Tesla issued to fund its expansion should be happy to convert them into stock, rather than demand cash repayment, taking some of the pressure off the company and its balance sheet.

Still, Tesla’s valuation remains impossible to justify by any standard metrics. Analysts’ average price target is more than 40% below the current level. Even Musk has suggested that the share price, which has almost trebled since the start of 2020, is too high — although, as with his taunting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and his comments about “fascist” lockdowns, it’s usually better to tune out what Musk says and focus on his actions instead.

The skeptics might have more faith in Tesla’s new position as the leader of the automaker pack when Musk stops his provocations and his shareholders stop getting giddy over modest good news.

595,2020-07-03T09:05:26+00:00,Display Maker Royole Said to Mull China IPO as U.S. Plans Stall,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese flexible display maker Royole Corp. is weighing an initial public offering in China while its planned U.S. listing is put on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.

Royole had filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO that could raise about $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. However, the startup is now considering a listing in China, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.

Considerations are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made, the people said. A representative for Royole declined to comment on the matter.

Royole, known for manufacturing the world’s first commercial foldable phone, had originally planned to raise funds via a private financing round at a valuation of about $8 billion, people familiar with that deal said last year. But the Chinese company turned to the U.S. markets after liquidity tightened during a downturn in China’s venture capital sector, the people said.

Since January relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated sharply, with tensions spanning trade, technology and Hong Kong. Many U.S.-listed Chinese companies are considering second listings closer to home in Hong Kong, while China has been actively seeking to lure innovative technology companies to list in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Royole competes with Samsung Electronics Co. and BOE Technology Group Co. to produce bendable screens using cutting-edge organic light-emitting diode technology. The company, which gave away wraparound-screen hats at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, in January unveiled a smart speaker that packs a bendable display around a cylinder.

Its full line of products encompasses head-mounted displays intended for use as so-called mobile theaters and other wearable flexible displays. The company even has a smart writing pad that it sells on Amazon.com, JD.com and in stores globally.

Royole’s earlier investors include Knight Capital, IDG Capital, Poly Capital Management, AMTD Group, the funds of Chinese tycoon Xie Zhikun and the venture capital arm of the Shenzhen city government.

597,2020-07-02T17:42:04+00:00,Nifty FAANG and Other 'One Decision' Investment Strategies,"If in early January, you'd have described to us everything that was to happen with the world and global economy and then asked us to guess where the stock market would be, we would not have guessed it would be at today's level.

Looking at the stock market today, the first thought that comes to mind is that it is divorced from economic reality. The S&P 500 is only a few percent away from where it started 2020.

SPY 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of SPY Peter Lynch Chart of SPY

On the surface it looks like stocks discount one incredibly rosy version of the future. In that version everything goes back to normal like nothing happened; we basically just entered and quickly exited a sharp recession and earnings came back to pre-coronavirus normal. Though that is a possible outcome, it is not a probable one, judging by what is happening right now. We'd like to note that, in any scenario, we'll exit with close to $10 trillion of additional debt on the government's and the Fed's balance sheets

I used the word discount. To discount something you bring future earnings (cash flows) at a discount rate to today's dollars. The Federal Reserve bought trillions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds of suspect quality through ETFs, taking interest rates to almost zero. This act has pushed the discount rate lower and wound up the spring of the music box in the Fed's game of musical chairs. So the market behavior to a large degree reflects not the sum of future scenarios but the much lower discount rate by which these scenarios are discounted.

Since the Fed is buying, the music is playing, and investors keep dancing (speculating). Greed is back. It seems that this music just keeps on playing.

But will it?

The economy is a very complex organic system created by trillions of individual transactions. The Fed's involvement introduces inorganic matter into the ecosystem that slowly poisons and atrophies the system. The Fed's active involvement distorts price signaling (higher prices lead to higher demand and vice versa) as it manipulates the price of the most fundamental commodity in the system - interest rates (the price of money).

Story continues

The Fed's buying junk bonds through ETFs has brought us closer to a Walking Dead economy. It has given a further lease on life to mostly dead companies that otherwise would have perished. But it's easy for me to sit here and criticize. If I ran the Fed in March 2020, I probably would have done the same thing - the possible cost of doing nothing would have been a global depression. The bottom line is that the Fed temporarily stimulated a humongous amount of greed in a system that was shaking in fear.

We are not investing in the economy we'd like to have, but in the one we have. However, this dance cannot go on forever or at some point the Fed will own all financial assets and the U.S. economy will turn into a Potemkin village. This is why, though it has been unfashionable and even counterproductive lately, we'll keep sticking to buying great, undervalued companies, not just great companies irrespective of price.

Nifty FANGAM

While you are pondering on this, here is another observation.

If you look deeper under the hood of the stock market, you'll see that there is a significant dichotomy between bytes stocks and atoms stocks. The atoms are losing to the bytes, badly. If you compare performance of the S&P 500 (SPY) traditional market-capitalization index - the one you see in the news - to its less-known cousin, the S&P 500 equal-weighted (RSP), you'll see a significant disparity in performance.

In the market cap-weighted version, the top five stocks (all five are members of FANGAM gang - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) now represent 21% of the capitalization of the index (the last time this happened was 1999) and thus account for 21% of the returns. In RSP these stocks have a weight of 1% (they're just 5 out of 500 stocks).

SPY is down 6% for the year, where RSP is down 16% - remember, same stocks, it's just that SPY is heavily weighted toward bytes stocks, as they have larger market caps, and RSP treats bytes and atoms equally. The virus has been much kinder to bytes than atoms stocks; it has benefitted those companies as our world has become a bit more virtual and atoms were impacted by social distancing. The problem is, bytes were very expensive going into the coronavirus crisis, and they just got even more pricey (unless their businesses have improved to a greater degree than their stocks prices appreciated, which is possible but unlikely, with the possible exception of Amazon).

Just as any propaganda needs a certain germ of truth to grow from, so do bubbles. The FANGAM are incredible companies (germ of truth), and they function better in the virus-infested world (another germ of truth). But at the core, their existence is grounded in the world that is built of atoms, not bytes.

For instance, Google's advertising business will continue to take market share from non-digital forms of advertisement (not sure if any are left), but atom-based companies are the largest source of Google's advertising revenue. If the atom world is not doing well, neither will Google. Also, the law of large numbers usually kicks in at some point: A company cannot grow at supernormal rates forever or it will become bigger than the market it is serving.

The Nifty Fifty stocks come to mind here. Those were the fifty stocks - the who's who of the 1960s -that made America great (then): Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG) ... the list goes on. Though today we look at some of them as has-beens, in the '60s and '70s the world was their oyster. Coke and McDonald's were spring chickens then, spreading the American health values of diabetes and cholesterol (okay, maybe I'm being too hard on them) across this awesome planet.

Although it was hard to imagine in the '70s that any of these companies would not shine forever, they are a useful reminder that even great companies get disrupted. Avon (AVP), Kodak (KODK), Polaroid, GE (GE), Xerox (XRX) -all were Nifty Fifties, and all either went bankrupt or are heading towards irrelevancy.

In the 1960s and early 1970s these stocks were one-rule stock - and the rule was, buy! They were bought, and bought, and bought. They were great companies and paying attention to how much you paid for them was irrelevant.

Until.

The Nifty FANGAM is arguably not as expensive as the Nifty Fifty was in 1972. Lawrence Hamtil put this nice table together, using data gathered by The Brooklyn Investor blog, which divides the Nifty Fifty stocks into two groups. The cheap basket traded at around 28 times earnings and the expensive basket at about 60 or so. Neither the cheap nor the expensive basket did well in the decade of the '70s. Today, FANGAM stocks in general trade closer to the cheap basket's valuation.

If you bought and held Coke or McDonald's in 1972 (or any other Nifty Fifty stock), then you experienced a painful decade of no returns; in fact, at times you were down 50% or more. Coca Cola was as great a company in 1974 as it was in 1972, but the stock was down 50% from its high. Okay, Coca Cola was trading at 47 times earnings in 1972. But even a company like Procter & Gamble that was trading at ""only"" 32 times earnings in 1972 was down almost 50% in 1974 from its 1972 high. It took until the early 80s - a decade - until investors who bought Nifty Fifties at the top broke even - and this applies to almost all of them.

Nifty Fifty (1970's)

In today's far less patient world, that decade might as well be infinity.

As I am writing this I am struggling with a few issues. First, interest rates and inflation were much higher in the '70s and early '80s. Now, interest rates are at zero, going to negative or to ... no idea what level. Globalization was deflationary, thus de-globalization will likely be inflationary; but automation may dampen the inflationary impact, at least some of it. If we get negative rates, then on one hand they should boost stocks' price-to-earnings ratio. (Paradoxically, the further a company's cash flow is in the future, the more it is worth in today's dollars. Yes, makes little sense to us, either). On the other hand, if we have negative rates, that means we are desperate and thus earnings are collapsing.

In an inflationary environment, most earnings growth will be eaten away by declining price-to-earnings, as it happened in the '70s.

Another issue: If you held many Nifty Fifties for 20 years, from 1972 to 1992, they would have delivered a decent (10%-plus) return. This sounds great in theory; however, most people would have run out of patience after a decade of no or negative returns and thus not have been around for the fruits of the '80s decade. In other words, shareholders who bought the stocks in 1970 were not the ones who benefitted from the returns in the late '80s.

Today the Nifty FANGAM has turned into one-rule stocks - buy! (irrespective of price). If you did not own them over the last decade, your portfolio had an enormous headwind against it.

But what the Nifty Fifties showed us is that company greatness and past growth are not enough. Starting valuation - what you actually pay for the business -matters. The great companies will still be great when their stocks are down a bunch and they have a decade of no returns. Dividends aside, stock returns in the long run are not just driven by earnings growth but by what the price-to-earnings does as well. If price-to-earnings is high, it's mean reverts - declines - chipping away at the return you receive from earnings growth. I (this is Vitaliy) wrote two books on this topic.

The '70s were almost fifty years ago. Fine, just look up Microsoft, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Coca Cola, and Wal-Mart (WMT) stock charts from the late '90s, and you'll see that history repeats itself, again and again (see charts below).

What you pay for even a great company matters. Paraphrasing the great Freddie Mercury, there must be more to the stock market than FANGAM (though that has not been the case lately). They were the tailwind for the S&P 500, but they'll likely turn into a headwind over the next decade, and become an anchor around its neck.

Nifty Nineties (1990's)

And one more thing...

I am not a journalist or reporter; I am an investor who thinks through writing. This and other investment articles are just my thinking at the point they were written. However, investment research is not static, it is fluid. New information comes our way and we continue to do research, which may lead us to tweak and modify assumptions and thus to change our minds.

We are long-term investors and often hold stocks for years, but as luck may or may not have it, by the time you read this article we may have already sold the stock. I may or may not write about this company ever again. Think of this and other articles as learning and thinking frameworks. But they are not investment recommendations. The bottom line is this. If this article piques your interest in the company I've mentioned, great. This should be the beginning, not the end, of your research.

The Japanese tech giant is working with a financial adviser on the potential offer for Leyou, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. In May, the Chinese gaming firm confirmed it had received a non-binding takeover offer from Shenzhen-listed rival Zhejiang Century Huatong Group Co., after months of buyout talks with other bidders including iDreamSky Technology Holdings Ltd.

Shares of Leyou extended their gains to as much as 9.8% after the Bloomberg News report. The stock has risen about 20% this year, giving the company a market value of about $1.1 billion.

Leyou’s controlling shareholder Charles Yuk had been in talks with iDreamSky for a majority stake sale since late last year. iDreamSky, which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd. among its investors, had been in discussions with CVC Capital Partners for a joint offer valuing Leyou at about $1.23 billion but the Covid-19 pandemic brought their talks to a stalemate, Bloomberg News reported in April.

Sony is hoping that it can edge out other bidders with greater certainty of financing, the people said. Leyou’s Yuk aims to choose a buyer and sign an agreement as soon as this month, the people said.

Talks are still ongoing and no final decision has been made, the people said. Other bidders could still emerge, they said. Representatives for Leyou and Sony declined to comment.

Leyou was listed in Hong Kong in 2011 and counts among its titles the free shooting games Warframe and Dirty Bomb. It’s also working with Amazon.com Inc. to co-produce a video game based on the popular fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings,” according to its website.

Sony has recently been aiming to beef up its content arsenal as the tech giant’s chief executive officer Kenichiro Yoshida believes that would in turn strengthen the value of its branded consumer electronics hardware. That includes PlayStation 5, the new video game console that the company plans to launch at the end of this year.

Story continues

Leyou’s Warframe is already available on PlayStation 4 and the company has said in its latest earnings report that it plans to expand the game to more platforms including the next-generation consoles.

599,2020-06-29T13:20:26+00:00,"Disney+ Hotstar to premiere Bollywood films, bypassing theatres","By Shilpa Jamkhandikar

MUMBAI, June 29 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's streaming service Disney+ Hotstar plans to premiere seven big ticket Bollywood films originally meant for theatrical release this year, as it seeks to expand its lead in subscribers over rivals Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video.

Monday's announcement follows similar moves in India by Netflix and Prime and deals a fresh blow to movie theatre operators like PVR and Inox Leisure, which have seen a raft of likely box office hits opt for digital releases due to theatre shutdowns in the COVID-19 pandemic.

""This is something that we've been thinking of for a long time. The pandemic provided this opportunity because a number of films that are ready or about to be ready don't have any clarity on when they can be released,"" said Uday Shankar, who heads Disney's operations in India.

India has eased restrictions around its more than two-month long nationwide lockdown, but malls, multiplexes and theatres largely remain shut.

Streaming platforms like Amazon and Netflix have in the past signed deals with Indian studios for digital rights, but mainstream releases have prioritised theatrical revenues in the past.

Shankar said direct-to-digital releases were always on the horizon, due to a lack movie screens and limited release windows in India, but the lockdown had accelerated the idea of releasing films digitally.

Hotstar reported 300 million monthly active users last year. Most use the free, advertising-supported service, but Disney has said it aims to convert many of these users into paying subscribers.

Disney acquired Hotstar via its $71 billion purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox's film and television assets in 2019. It rebranded the service as Disney+ Hotstar in April.

Hotstar said the first release, a Bollywood remake of the Hollywood hit ""The Fault in Our Stars"", will be released on July 24 this year.

600,2020-06-29T06:00:41+00:00,The Mall Can’t Survive If There Aren’t Any Stores,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Rent collection day last Wednesday looked like a disaster for mall landlords in the U.K. Reeling from the coronavirus lockdown, tenants including JD Sports Fashions Plc, Boots drugstores and Primark withheld some payments pending negotiations with landlords. Estimates vary widely as to how much was paid of the 2.5 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) due — from 10% to 50%.

This isn’t just bad news for Lakeside mall-owner Intu Properties Plc, which on Friday collapsed into administration. Missing rents affect everyone, including property developers Hammerson Plc and British Land Co.

Whatever the final tally, the balance of power between retailers and their landlords has indelibly shifted. The days when well-known retail chains signed 25-year leases dictating that rents only rose were already largely consigned to history. But the retail apocalypse wrought by Covid-19 means that landlords have no choice but to accept even shorter leases and far more flexible terms with a good dose of the right services thrown in.

As I have argued, the pain from the pandemic must be shared between retailers and property owners on both sides of the Atlantic. The future of the mall depends on it.Brick-and-mortar outlets were already facing existential questions from the rise of Amazon.com Inc. and other online retailers, and many traditional retailers had started to embrace e-commerce too. Covid-19 is accelerating this shift. At the end of last year, digital accounted for about 30% of U.K. retail sales excluding food. This could increase to more than 40% over the next year or so, according to independent retail analyst Richard Hyman.

The trend makes store economics even more challenging. Moving sales online has its own costs, from stock management to processing returns, which can’t be offset with a commensurate reduction in store expenses. And now retailers have to invest to adapt their shops to social-distancing rules.

With such pressure on profits, some stores will inevitably have to close. Those that don’t will have to cut costs, and that includes rent. In order to better manage cash flows, it’s imperative they be allowed to move to monthly rent payments from quarterly ones.

Story continues

Another option is for landowners to offer so-called turnover rent deals based on a proportion of in-store sales, usually underpinned by a minimum fee. This model, already common in off-price retail parks, aligns everyone’s interests. It gives mall owners an incentive to make their properties as appealing to customers as possible, with a pleasant environment, concierge services and a good mix of tenants covering retail, food and leisure. And retailers would be more inclined to sign for a longer period.

The downside for property companies is more uncertainty because they cannot count on a guaranteed income stream to pay down their debt. Still, this is probably better than an empty unit.

As push comes to shove, it’s best relations stay cordial. After all, retailers have promised to pay their landlord, and rent that hasn’t been collected during the pandemic isn’t written off. Yes, there’s a case for leniency when chains are clearly in distress. But it’s harder to justify withholding what’s due when retailers have remained largely open, such as Boots, or are in good shape financially, such as JD Sports.

There are good reasons to encourage constructive dialogue. Store chains that take an aggressive stance may be exposing themselves to legal action. In the U.S., Gap Inc. is facing suits from Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP. Plus, now that leases are much shorter, discussions over the proper rent come around much more frequently. When they do, companies that paid in full during the crisis may be able to secure better terms than those that reneged.

With no let up in the ferocity of retail competition, it’s smart to strike more favorable deals in the future. But any tense moments should be saved for the contract negotiations, not quarter day.

601,2020-06-25T03:52:54+00:00,Amazon to build new facilities in Australia as online demand surges - AFR,"SYDNEY, June 25 (Reuters) - Retail giant Amazon Inc is expanding its Australian operations with plans to build a warehouse in Sydney and is also scouting locations for a giant facility in Melbourne, the Australian Financial Review reported on Thursday.

An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on 'speculations or our future plans.'

In a separate stock exchange filing, Australia's Brickworks Ltd said it was in 'advanced discussions' with a customer for a warehouse development near Sydney through a 50-50 joint venture with industrial property giant Goodman Group .

Brickworks, which has an industrial property division, did not name the 'major client.'

CEO Lindsay Partridge told Reuters in an interview Brickworks' industrial property business has been doing well with rental receipts ""still coming in strongly.""

""We have the Coles warehouse which has been announced to build and we are in advanced discussion with another major client,"" he said.

When asked if he was referring to Amazon, Partridge said ""that's the speculation.""

Amazon's reported expansion plans come on the back of surging online sales as consumers shift to e-tailing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Just two weeks ago, Amazon had announced the opening of its first Queensland fulfilment centre in Brisbane later this year. The company currently has three fulfilment centres in Australia, based in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.

602,2020-06-24T17:03:19+00:00,Video Game Industry Rocked by Outpouring of Sexual Misconduct Allegations,"(Bloomberg) -- Dozens of women took to social media over the past few days to outline explosive allegations against prominent men in the world of video gaming and streaming, setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a #MeToo reckoning for the $150 billion video game industry.

Four women leveled accusations of sexual misconduct against Chris Avellone, a critically acclaimed video game writer, leading one developer to end its cooperation with him and prompting him to part ways with another game in the works. A different woman accused Omeed Dariani, the chief executive officer of Online Performers Group, a talent agency that works with many video streamers, of making an unwelcome sexual overture. Dariani resigned from his position on Sunday. Some streamers began calling for a blackout Wednesday of Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch, the biggest game streaming platform, alleging that it turns a blind eye to misbehavior.

The gaming industry has for years been criticized as unwelcoming—if not hostile—to women, but has not yet faced the #MeToo movement on the same scale as Hollywood and other industries. This week’s flurry of postings was unique in terms of its volume and public nature, and it has sent ripples across the industry. Accusations began appearing on Twitter late Friday night and each new post emboldened other women to publicly share their stories. Many of the postings about the men accused of misconduct were subsequently compiled in a thread on Medium.

Some of the people identified in postings have denied wrongdoing, while others have apologized for their behavior. Many were not identified by their legal names, but by the names they are known by on social media.

Dariani’s accuser said the CEO proposed that she join him and his wife for a sexual encounter. Dariani didn’t respond to requests for comment but said on Twitter that while he didn’t recall the conversation, he believed his accuser, Molly Fender Ayala. When asked for comment by Bloomberg News, she said her public post expresses everything she “feels comfortable with sharing at this time. My intention was to bring light to a larger issue in the gaming industry and hopefully protect young women who are entering the space.” Twitch said it’s investigating reports of misconduct and that it “supports people coming forward.”

Story continues

Some of the most detailed allegations were brought against Avellone, who replied on Twitter to one of the women, Karissa, saying he “never meant any harm” to her or a friend of hers that he had dated. “If I can't do anything to apologize for it, I understand, and there's nothing more to be done.” Karissa, who spoke to Bloomberg News about her allegations, declined to give her last name for fear of harassment.

Avellone, who has written for popular games such as Planescape: Torment and Fallout: New Vegas, was a founder and co-owner of the video game studio Obsidian Entertainment Inc. from 2003 until 2015. Since then, he has been a freelance designer and writer for games including Prey and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. His work as a writer has been lauded by fans and critics. Industry publication Game Developer magazine listed him as one of the field’s top writers in 2009.

In interviews with Bloomberg News, two women shared similar but separate stories of Avellone buying a continuous stream of drinks for them and others at an event and then making unwanted sexual advances on the two women. One, Karissa, said it happened when she met Avellone at a convention one weekend in 2012; the second said it happened at an event in 2013. A third woman, who now works at a large video game company, posted on Twitter a screen shot of sexually explicit messages she said she had received from Avellone in 2013, when she was seeking to break into the industry. A fourth wrote on Twitter that Avellone had “groped me repeatedly” at a nightclub in 2014.

Avellone didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian’s chief executive officer, declined to comment on Avellone.

On Friday evening, Karissa accused Avellone of getting her “blackout drunk” and trying to sleep with her, calling him “an abusive, abrasive, conniving sexual predator” in a thread of messages on Twitter. After being contacted by Bloomberg, Karissa, who asked that her last name not be printed for fear of harassment, elaborated in a phone interview. She said she met Avellone through friends in the gaming industry at a convention in 2012. At the hotel bar, Karissa said, Avellone put down his Obsidian credit card and bought multiple rounds of drinks for attendees.

“They were coming so quickly,” said Karissa. “It was almost like as soon as my drink was gone, Chris already had one or two more for me. I remember refusing him, just being like, ‘I'm good, I don't need another one.’ He would literally just be like, ‘Come on, let's go to the bar, let's get you another one.’ He did that multiple times throughout the night.”

Karissa said the alcohol “all hit me at once,” and that she remembers walking back to her hotel room with Avellone and two of her friends. She said she vaguely remembers Avellone trying to kiss her on the way up, and kissing her again when they arrived at the hallway outside her room. At one point, Avellone then put a hand down her pants, after which she told him to stop, Karissa said she remembers. “I told him this is not a good idea,” she said. “He stopped, then took his hand out of my pants. I think he kissed me one more time, and then left.”

After that night, Karissa said she remained friendly with Avellone, and that he was “a perfect gentleman” the rest of the weekend, which “kind of pushed off what had happened in my head.” She said that their friendship ended after he had a difficult relationship with one of her other friends, and that it only occurred to her recently that something went wrong that night in 2012.“It actually didn't start to click with me until other women in the industry started coming forward with their stories, and seeing how similar they were to mine,” Karissa said, referring to the outpouring that began on Friday. She spoke up after seeing an interview with Avellone on the gaming website IGN for The Waylanders, a new video game he was helping write.

One friend of Karissa, who asked not to be named because the person still works in the video game industry, confirmed to Bloomberg News that they heard the same story from Karissa about a month after it happened.

Christy Dena, a video game designer, said she and Avellone had been friendly for years when they met up at a convention in Melbourne in 2013. She went out drinking with him and a few other friends, she said in an interview, and he was “continuously buying drinks” for the group. “At every event we went to, he’d just put the company card down and buy everybody drinks,” Dena said.

The two of them went back to her hotel room, Dena said, and that the next thing she remembers is waking up next to him with no clothes on. “I remember going back to the room, but then I don't remember much of what happened in the room at all,” she said. “And then just waking up in the morning. He said, ‘Oh, we didn't do anything,’ but of course my clothes were off.”

Dena said she kept in touch with Avellone but wasn’t interested in pursuing any sort of relationship with him. She chose to speak up after seeing Karissa’s accusations. “When Karissa put the post out, and I read things she said, I thought, ‘Oh, this is a pattern of behavior,’” Dena said. “It wasn't just me.”

She has stopped drinking as a result of this and other uncomfortable incidents involving other men at video game industry events. “It's one of those things it took me a very long time to learn,” Dena said. “People are not in a consenting state when they're drunk.”

In rare instances over the past three years, accusations have emerged against powerful men, including a depiction of a culture of sexism at Riot Games, Inc. and a sexual assault allegation against a former top developer at Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.’s Rockstar Games, the maker of Grand Theft Auto. (Three weeks after the article’s publication in online gaming magazine Kotaku in 2018, Riot Games said it had ""much to improve"" and that it would overhaul many of its practices. Rockstar Games declined to comment on the allegations raised in the story published last year and the executive accused denied the allegations.)

On Saturday night, Jacqui Collins, a public relations representative for Riot Games, shared a screenshot of sexually explicit text messages from Avellone on Twitter. “This was before I was full time in the games industry, but knew I wanted a future in it and was actively working towards that,” she wrote. “Chris was one of the ‘industry greats’ I was frankly flattered to even know let alone be friendly with. So I forgave and regularly asked him career advice.”

The women’s accusations have had real-world implications for Avellone. Techland Sp., a Polish game developer, said Monday on Twitter that it planned to stop working with Avellone, who was part of the narrative team for the company's next game, Dying Light 2. And Emily Grace Buck, the lead writer of The Waylanders, has since said Avellone is no longer on the project and that she would “take an extra look” at his work.

Other companies have also said they plan to investigate accounts this week. Video game publisher Ubisoft Entertainment SA. said it was “deeply concerned” by sexual misconduct allegations against some of its employees, according to Gamasutra. Insomniac Games, Inc., the Sony-owned developer of the Spider-Man video games, said it was also investigating a former employee’s allegations of sexual misconduct.

603,2020-06-23T21:43:34+00:00,Brazil ecommerce jumps 57% in first five months of 2020 fueled by COVID-19,"By Gabriela Mello

SAO PAULO, June 23 (Reuters) - Brazilian e-commerce has risen by 56.8% in the first five months of 2020 from a year earlier, reaching 105.6 billion reais ($20.50 billion) in sales revenue, a survey showed on Tuesday, as more consumers have shifted to online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic.

The number of online orders grew by 65,7% in the same comparison, mostly driven by three categories: cosmetics and perfumes, furniture and eletronics, according to data compiled by Brazilian ecommerce consultancy Compre&Confie and industry body ABComm.

""Consumers are more and more involved in online shopping particularly in categories related to basic needs and efforts to prevent COVID-19,"" said André Dias, director at Compre&Confie.

Brazil's ecommerce growth was also boosted as smaller merchants and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have pushed to boost their own online sales, the survey showed.

""It is possible to start selling online quickly and simply, without the need for large investments,"" Mauricio Salvador, president of Brazilian ecommerce association ABComm, added in a statement.

Brazil's Northeastern region posted a 60.9% rise in online sales in the first five months of 2020, marking the highest percentage growth among all areas.

Major ecommerce firms such as MercadoLibre and Amazon.com have been investing to bolster their logistics infrastructure in the Northeast of Brazil in a push to expedite deliveries and challenge local retailers such as Magazine Luiza, B2W Companhia Digital and Via Varejo.

604,2020-06-19T12:56:05+00:00,The 3 Best Vanguard ETFs  for a Long-Term Retirement Portfolio,"When building a retirement portfolio, the goal is to grow your assets for the long term. Since no one knows which asset classes will lead and which will lag, diversification is paramount. And Vanguard ETFs are an easy way to get some diversification.

If you’re further than 10 years from retirement, it’s wise to lean towards a more aggressive portfolio to capture the higher equity returns. As retirement approaches, dial back equities and increase fixed and cash equivalent holdings.

If you’re healthy and retire in your 60’s you might have an additional 20-plus years in retirement, so don’t forgo the stock market. In fact, you may want to ramp up equity investing as your retirement advances. This reverse glidepath strategy was suggested by Michael Kitces and Wade Pfau in an article on the Nerd’s Eye View entitled, “Should Equity Exposure Decrease In Retirement, Or Is A Rising Equity Glidepath Actually Better?”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

These three Vanguard exchange-traded funds will work when building a retirement portfolio as well as during the drawdown years. Each of the Vanguard funds can be purchased through any investment account, while other financial firms offer comparable funds. The key to this simple retirement portfolio is to  invest in low-fee index ETFs that fit within these categories.

7 A-Rated Growth Stocks That Are Loaded With Long-Term Potential

The rationale for a three-fund retirement portfolio is as follows. First, a simple investment portfolio in retirement leaves time for what matters most. Second, it provides diversification to minimize losses in a particular sector while maintaining broad exposure to the main asset classes and global markets. And finally, it cuts investment fees to the bone.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (NYSEARCA:VEU) Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NASDAQ:BND)

And now, let’s get further into why I like these three funds in particular.

Story continues

Best Vanguard ETFs: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

Expense Ratio: 0.03%, or $3 per $10,000 invested annually.

This U.S. stock market fund tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index. The benchmark includes companies spanning the mega-, large-, small- and micro-capitalization field and represents nearly 100% of the U.S. investable equity market.

The fund utilizes a passively managed, index-sampling strategy. VTI offers rock-bottom expenses and minimal tracking error versus the benchmark index. This total stock market fund owns roughly 3,500 stocks, with 22.6% of the assets in the 10 largest names.

The fund uses a market cap weighting, which means that returns will be influenced by the momentum growth of the biggest firms.

Investors seeking a more value-leaning equal weight US stock index fund might consider the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA:RSP).

The funds sector weightings approximate the benchmark index, with approximately 25% in the technology sector, 17% in financials, 15% in healthcare and 14% in consumer services.

The largest holdings read like a who’s-who in American commerce and include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The returns of the fund parallel those of the index with a 10-year average annual return of 12.8%, and one-, three- and five-year returns of 11.5%, 9.6%, and 9.2% respectively.

Investing in the U.S. equity market has been a sound investment strategy for decades, and the 0.03% expense ratio is among the most affordable ways of capturing this growth. The current 1.8% 30-day SEC yield is higher than investors receive on most short-term cash equivalents.

Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU)

Expense Ratio: 0.08%

This large-cap-leaning international fund invests in developing and emerging market global companies. The passively managed fund attempts to match the returns of the FTSE All World ex-U.S. index. Investors willing to take a bit more risk for potentially higher returns among Vanguard ETFs might consider the Vanguard Total Stock International Index ETF (NASDAQ:VXUS) instead, which includes greater small-cap international exposure.

Like VTI, the VEU’s holdings are weighted by market cap, so the larger companies are a greater proportion of the fund. The allocation is geographically diversified, with 41% invested in Europe, 23% in in Emerging Markets, 29% in the Pacific and the remaining firms from North America and the Middle East.

The top holdings are well-known global names. Although, the top 10 holdings make up only 11.5% of the total fund assets. The largest holdings include Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) and Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Other major companies are representatives of the auto, pharmaceutical, electronic and oil industries.

10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge

The fund’s 0.08% expense ratio keeps most investment dollars in the markets, not flowing to the fund manager. Recently, international markets have underperformed the U.S., but seem to be turning around this year.

Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

Expense Ratio: 0.035%

A total bond market fund rounds out this three-piece retirement portfolio of Vanguard ETFs. Bonds are still valuable to own as eventually; interest rates will rise along with bond yields.

Another Vanguard low-fee offer, BND is an intermediate bond fund with the objective to track a broad, market-weight bond index. Included in the fund are taxable investment-grade U.S. bonds. With 9,568 bonds and an average duration of 6.4 years, the current SEC yield is 1.4%.

The fund is heavily weighted to U.S. Government bonds, with 61% in this asset class. The next-highest weighting of 19% is in Baa rated bonds. And 12.6% of the fund is invested in A bonds with a small percent allocated to Aaa and Aa rated bonds. The 0.035% expense ratio is negligible.

In summation, create your asset allocation to fit your comfort with investment volatility. Allot greater percentages to the stock market if you’re younger and more comfortable with risk. If not, bulk up your bond investment.

Retirees should consider their short and intermediate cash flow needs and invest accordingly. Meanwhile, it’s prudent to keep at least one year’s living expenses in a high yield cash account.

MILAN, June 16 (Reuters) - Italy's top pay-TV operator SKY said on Tuesday it was providing a wider range of services to households as it added a broadband connection in its offering of movies, sport and other content, to boost revenues in the crowded telecoms market.

The Comcast unit announced the move after a two-month lockdown to curb a coronavirus outbreak when Italy's data traffic using fixed lines almost doubled as people worked and studied from home, and spent their free time streaming videos.

""We're interested in becoming the main player in people's living rooms and the rest of their homes,"" the head of SKY's Italian operations Maximo Ibarra said in a presentation, adding that the plans did not include offering mobile services.

Italy has one of the lowest fiber-to-the-home usage in Europe. Demand for ultrafast home connections is expected to rise in the coming months, as many people are expected to continue working from home.

""We have been forced home, putting the Italian telecoms infrastructure under great stress,"" said Ibarra, a former top executive at Dutch telecoms operator KPN.

SKY has invested 230 million euros ($261 million) to launch its broadband service in Italy, he said.

SKY will provide the service using the fiber-optic infrastructure of wholesale broadband firm Open Fiber, jointly owned by Italian utility Enel and state lender CDP.

SKY's service will start in 26 cities this month and will extend to 120 during the summer.

Ibarra said it would be extended further as Open Fiber's coverage expanded. In the meantime, SKY has signed a deal with Swisscom's Fastweb to reach clients in areas not currently covered by Open Fiber.

SKY's entrance in the broadband business will add pressure on former state phone monopoly Telecom Italia, which has steadily lost market share in the fixed-line segment.

The content services offered by SKY, which has 5.2 million customers, are facing increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

607,2020-06-16T10:00:00+00:00,Verizon joins Amazon and Global Optimism in signing The Climate Pledge,"Commits to meeting the Paris Agreement 10 years early

Verizon has committed to become carbon neutral by 2035

NEW YORK, June  16, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Today, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) announced it has joined The Climate Pledge - the commitment co-founded by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Global Optimism to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early. The Climate Pledge calls on new signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040 - a decade ahead of the Paris Accord’s goal of 2050.

Verizon is on track to be carbon neutral across scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2035 and has issued a $1 billion green bond to invest in innovative solutions to accelerate the company’s sustainability efforts. This includes powering operations with 50% renewable energy by 2025 and new virtual power purchase agreements (VPPA) for more than 380 MW of new wind and solar power capacity.

“Climate change is a global challenge that impacts everyone, and that is why we considered it vital to join The Climate Pledge,” said Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon. “Leaving future generations with a cleaner world is core to our values as a responsible business. At Verizon, it does not stop with reducing our carbon footprint. Through our technology and networks, we’re innovating solutions for customers, increasing efficiencies and building resiliency across the company and the communities we serve.”

Verizon and other companies that sign The Climate Pledge agree to:

Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis;Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies;Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.

“I’m excited that Verizon is signing The Climate Pledge and committing to reach the Paris Agreement ten years early. Tackling climate change requires innovation, leadership, and partnership - no one can do it alone,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “Verizon has set aggressive goals to increase energy efficiency across its operations and power its business with 50% renewable energy by 2025 - on the path to achieving net zero carbon by 2040.”

“As the climate crisis worsens, more companies will need to get serious and challenge themselves to achieve decarbonization at a faster pace,” said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s former climate change chief and founding partner of Global Optimism. “Verizon is committing to an accelerated timeline that will move the needle against the race to stop the continued warming of our planet. Actions like this will cut emissions and slow down the damage that has been done, but we have to act now.”

By joining The Climate Pledge and agreeing to decarbonize at a faster rate, Verizon will play a critical role in stimulating investment in the development of low carbon products and services that will be required to help companies meet the pledge.

* Deals position MultiChoice for future

* Streaming uptake in Africa currently relatively small

JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Reuters) - Adding streaming services will give Africa's biggest pay-TV group, MultiChoice, a head start when online viewing takes off on the continent, it said on Thursday, after revealing it had deals with Netflix and Amazon.

CEO Calvo Mawela, in a presentation on Thursday, did not name the partners or give further details of the partnerships but the deals with Netflix and Amazon were included in the company's results presentation on its website.

""We need to start preparing ourselves to make sure... we become the platform of choice for people to consume these services,"" he said, in the presentation on Thursday, referring to streaming.

""If you are a one-stop-shop where they can get all of this... we position ourselves very well in the market for us to gain customers,"" he said.

Netflix poses a growing competitive threat to MultiChoice and its own streaming service, Showmax, and the partnership move marks a shift in MultiChoice's strategy from trying to compete with such players to working with them instead.

MultiChoice declined to answer Reuters when questioned on the partnerships.

Netflix and Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

MultiChoice currently serves 19.5 million households in 50 African countries, but outside of its home market, South Africa, it believes poor internet access currently makes a rapid uptake of streaming services unlikely.

Chief Financial Officer Tim Jacobs said on Wednesday that because there was still limited overlap between the services the company sees all of them as complementary.

MultiChoice on Wednesday reported its first annual profit since being spun off by parent Naspers.

610,2020-06-10T10:10:51+00:00,Big oil might really see a decade of change in one year: Morning Brief,"Wednesday, June 10, 2020

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET.

When the industry is in secular decline, recessions accelerate trends.

A common phrase that has become received business wisdom in this pandemic crisis is that 10 years of change will happen in one year.

Some of the early returns on this are mixed.

Shares of Zoom (ZM), for instance, have gone up a lot as people do more video calls. Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) shares have outperformed amid increasing demand for at-home deliveries and at-home entertainment.

But not all changes forced upon us because of shelter-at-home policies and concerns about public health seem likely to stick around.

Working from home, for example, is fine for a bit. And indeed, some tech companies like Twitter (TWTR) will give employees the option to work from home on a permanent basis. Other tech leaders including Google (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, however, have expressed some skepticism that distributed workforces will be the rule instead of the exception in the future.

And with the arrival of summer and broad state reopenings in the U.S., we see consumers returning to restaurants, casinos, and traveling. In recent weeks, airline, casino, and cruise stocks have rebounded sharply as investors cast doubt on the idea that our post-COVID future will look nothing like the past. And this coming despite the virus still spreading at a faster rate in several states.

But for industries already in the midst of secular upheavals, the coronavirus pandemic does indeed seem to be an accelerant for permanent change in the way that pundits predicted.

Few industries entered like the 2020s facing a decade of transformational change quite like big oil.

And the industry's pandemic response has indeed been swift and large-scale.

On Monday, BP (BP) said that it would lay off 15% of its workforce, or about 10,000 of its 70,100 employees, according to Reuters.

Story continues

Reuters added that BP CEO Bernard Looney told staff, ""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower-carbon company.” A BP spokesman added that the pandemic ""amplified and accelerated"" BP's transition plans, according to Reuters.

Other companies in the energy space including Chevron (CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-A) among others have also announced planned reductions in their workforce.

Goldman Sachs strategists highlighted commentary from Schlumberger’s (SLB) earnings call in a report last month after management told analysts that, “we have accelerated our remote operation and automation of some of our operations. In the month of March, we had more than 60%, 6-0, 60% of our drilling [operations]...that were using remote operation.”

Because while the price of oil has rebounded over the last six weeks following the unprecedented move into negative territory in April, the industry is still facing a future in which demand for oil will be lower while demands for reducing negative climate impacts will be higher.

The rally in stocks like Nikola (NKLA) and Tesla (TSLA) — while certainly part of a mania sweeping through the retail segment of the market — can also be seen as part of a future in which the shift to clean energy is less talk and more action.

And a future that may indeed bring a decade’s worth of changes to big oil in the next year alone.

611,2020-06-06T00:00:22+00:00,WhatsApp Gets a Raw Deal in Payments,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Money is many things, but it’s not fake news. So why block WhatsApp from spreading it around?

India is the laboratory of choice for Western tech firms to test out their mobile payment capabilities so they can be rolled out from Bangladesh to Nigeria. Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg entered the fray two years ago by enabling the popular messaging service WhatsApp to send and receive money in India. But the beta version, limited to 1 million users, keeps getting blocked from becoming a full-fledged service.

Meanwhile, rivals such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pay, Walmart Inc.-owned PhonePe and Softbank Group Corp.-backed Paytm are dominating India’s mobile transfers landscape. The troika led with 75 million, 60 million and 30 million customers transacting last month, respectively, according to TechCrunch.

While Facebook Inc. deserves scrutiny globally for providing a platform for hate speech, voter manipulation and dissemination of untruth, cashless transfers is one area where WhatsApp can be a force for good. That’s especially true in emerging economies like India. As the Covid-19 lockdown has underscored, hundreds of millions of rural migrant workers in urban centers lack both liquid savings and a state-provided safety net. Increasingly ubiquitous smartphones can bring vulnerable citizens the financial security that bank branches can’t supply.

To restrain WhatsApp is a waste of the infrastructure India has built. Four years ago, the country set up a shared interface linking more than 150 participating banks. An account holder in any of them can send or receive money to anybody else on the network. The two parties don’t need to know anything more than each other’s mobile number or a virtual ID. From Google to Walmart, any app can tap the common protocol, which already supports transactions worth more than 10% of gross domestic product. Google is so impressed it wants the U.S. Federal Reserve to consider adopting the standard.

Story continues

WhatsApp needs a nod from the regulator, the National Payments Corporation of India, to throw open the switch. The first roadblock was the central bank’s requirement that payment data be stored only locally. That hurdle has been crossed, but the service remains restricted. In February, a little-known think tank filed a lawsuit, asking India’s Supreme Court to block payments on WhatsApp “since it’s known to have failed to secure sensitive data of its users.” In an affidavit this week, WhatsApp said that the petition by the “busybody” was not maintainable. Legal challenges in India can drag on endlessly.

The popularity of the messaging app, which has more than 400 million Indian users, is its biggest strength and its worst enemy. Take pinBox, which wants to introduce digital micro-pensions to the masses across Asia and Africa. It’s waiting eagerly for WhatsApp payments. The combination of financial and digital illiteracy can be a showstopper; it’s much easier to promote a saving culture on a messaging app where people spend most of their waking hours, anyway.

The familiarity with the medium cuts both ways. Recently, the service was used to accuse Muslims in India of deliberately transmitting Covid-19, triggering assaults on the minority community. But then, disinformation isn’t limited either to WhatsApp or India. TikTok, the most-downloaded app during the pandemic, had posts claiming that 5G technology helps spread the virus, fueling violence against telecommunications workers and equipment across the U.K. and Europe. In India, the user-video platform has raised hackles for enabling sharing of content that promotes acid attacks on women.

While regulators should push Zuckerberg to keep making social media safer, for instance by restricting message forwarding, they need to be pragmatic when it comes to online payments. China is far ahead. But that market, in the pincer grasp of Alipay and WeChat Pay wallets, isn’t open to U.S. firms. Besides, the scope for replacing cash is bigger in India, where 14% of money supply is still currency in circulation, a figure that China has crunched to 4%. The size of the opportunity is why India is attracting attention.

Facebook recently took a 10% stake in Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Platforms Ltd. for $5.7 billion. Jio’s 4G network is India’s biggest, with nearly 400 million customers. Ambani, Asia’s richest man, wants to connect a billion-plus buyers with neighborhood stores, combining physical and digital retail. Payments via WhatsApp will be a way to achieve that link, with brands giving discounts and financiers offering in-store credit based on Jio’s scoring model.

Others will catch up. Amazon.com Inc. is planning to take a $2 billion stake in Bharti Airtel Ltd., Jio’s closest rival, Reuters has reported. According to the Financial Times, Google is exploring an investment in Vodafone Group Plc’s struggling India wireless business. (Vodafone Idea Ltd. said there’s no such proposal before its board.)

The rising global interest in digitizing the billion-plus-people economy could be sustained, as it coincides with what may be a long-drawn tech cold war between China and the West. Although India has recognized privacy to be a fundamental right, giving grounds for legal challenges against tech firms, it has yet to enact a data protection law. That’s where the focus has to be, not on limiting competition. The central bank needs to strike a balance between safeguarding financial stability and encouraging innovation such as “account aggregators,” who compile and share financial data with the consent of users looking for loans or insurance. With most manufacturing and services in disarray, helping money go viral is India’s best chance to break out of the Covid gloom.

612,2020-06-05T06:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Ocean shipping shrinks as pandemic pummels retailers,"By Jonathan Saul, Lisa Baertlein and Sonya Dowsett

LONDON/LOS ANGELES/MADRID, June 5 (Reuters) - The $1 trillion container shipping industry is in a slowdown. Literally.

Some shipping lines, whose retail customers are being hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, are reducing sailing speeds and taking longer routes around Africa, avoiding Suez canal passage fees, according to the companies and ship-tracking specialists.

Many are also cutting down the number of voyages and providing short-term storage for clients as the industry, which includes heavyweights like Maersk, MSC and Hapag-Lloyd, faces its biggest downturn since the 2008 financial crisis.

The new tactics not only save on costs, but also help adapt to the needs of cash-crunched retailers - among their biggest customers - who are stuck with huge inventory surpluses thanks to COVID-19 store closures and a collapse in consumer demand.

Slower shipping times also means importers can delay payments made on delivery.

From sportswear maker Puma to mall stalwart Gap , many retailers have been forced to reduce or slow down shipments of new merchandise. Civil unrest in the United States has compounded their problems by further clouding the prospect for a recovery in the world's biggest retail sales market.

Puma's Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, for example, said it was managing some of its excess inventory by stowing it on slow-going ships as stores in the United States and Europe tentatively reopen.

However, at the same time, the shipping slowdown has created headaches for those retailers, from Walmart and Amazon to shoe seller Rothy's, who have never stopped selling products to homebound consumers, ranging from books and shoes to exercise equipment, much of it sold online.

Now those retailers are fighting for space on the fewer, faster-moving ships on the high seas.

""What we are seeing is quite a mixed situation from cargo owners, some of which are resuming normal shipment of their cargoes, others are requesting routings via longer transit times,"" said Marcus Leaver, chief operating officer of sea freight at Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, which organizes shipments for companies such as retailers.

Story continues

A lack of space on ships is leading to more ""rollovers"", where containers are bumped from packed vessels to later ones, like passengers on oversold flights, according to importers.

Spanish retailer Mango, which has continued to sell online during the pandemic, told Reuters it was seeing an increase in service cancellations by shipping companies, which caused instability and ""space problems"".

It added that 99% of its imports from Asia were now coming by sea because air costs had gone up due to a lack of flights and the priority given to medical equipment.

'A LOT OF TROUBLE'

The stakes are high for the container industry. Retail goods such as clothes, luggage and furniture represent about 15% of shipped volumes, a Reuters analysis of industry data shows.

Soren Skou, CEO of Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping group, said many of its big customers were retailers or suppliers to retailers.

""There are some traditional retailers in a lot of trouble and, as you know, some have started to go bankrupt,"" Skou said last month. ""Some customers ask us to delay shipments and we have found extra storage and warehouse facilities for them.""

Shereen Zarkani, Maersk's global head of sales, told Reuters: ""One customer told us: If you make my container go around the world a couple of times that would be good.""

The volume of apparel arriving in the United States by ship dropped nearly 20% in January-May versus the same period last year, and reached 379,910 TEUs (20-foot equivalent container units), data from logistics technology company Descartes showed.

Furniture volumes fell over 12% in the same period, while luggage dropped over 34%.

The first blow landed when the novel coronavirus forced China to shutter factories in February, cutting off supplies of apparel, electronics and other retail goods to the world. The second came when stores in Europe and the United States closed, leading companies like Topshop owner Arcadia Group, Gap and off-price retailers Marshalls and TJ Maxx to cancel orders.

""When you look at the East-West trades we are right now looking at 15% to 20% (taken out) across the industry,"" Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of German-based Hapag-Lloyd, said last month pointing to the fall in capacity in recent weeks.

OUTLOOK: STORMY

There does not appear to be any let-up in sight for container shipping companies as their retail clients could still be feeling acute financial pain in July, when they begin placing orders for holiday and winter merchandise.

Jay Foreman, CEO of Florida-based toy supplier Basic Fun, which sells to retailers including Walmart and Target Corp , said he expected a 20% decrease in business this year.

Indeed, the outlook for retail is dim: Euromonitor forecasts that U.S. retail sales will fall more than 6% this year.

James Conroy, CEO of California-based clothing company Boot Barn Holdings, told analysts it faced ""several headwinds"".

""High unemployment, extremely depressed oil prices and a shift toward online shopping will present challenges for us as we progress through the next six to 12 months,"" he said.

613,2020-06-05T03:25:05+00:00,Amazon Eyes $2 Billion Stake in Bharti Airtel: Report,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is in preliminary talks to buy a stake in No. 2 Indian carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd. for at least $2 billion, Reuters reported, joining Facebook Inc. and other U.S. giants in betting on one of the world’s fastest-growing internet arenas.

The U.S. online retailer is in early-stage discussions to buy about a 5% stake in the Indian wireless operator, Reuters said, citing anonymous sources. A deal will help Amazon access Bharti’s 300 million subscribers -- a user base akin to the entire U.S. population. On Friday, the Indian carrier said in a statement it wasn’t considering any proposal to sell a stake to Amazon, referring to reports as “speculative.”

American technology and investment giants have been buying stakes in Indian companies to build their presence in Asia’s second-most populous nation. Facebook agreed to invest about $5.7 billion into a unit of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. in April, while Microsoft Corp. is reportedly considering a stake in the same company.

Amazon already has deep roots in India, where Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has visited and vowed to build one of his biggest e-commerce operations outside of the U.S. Bezos, now the world’s richest man, said during a trip in January that his company would invest another $1 billion on top of the billions it’s shelled out to bring small and medium-size businesses online. Amazon is now vying with Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart to tap an increasingly affluent population adopting smartphones at a rapid clip.

An Amazon spokeswoman in India declined to comment. “We routinely work with all digital and OTT players and have deep engagement with them to bring their products, content and services for our wide customer base. Beyond that there is no other activity to report,” a Bharti spokesperson said.

An influx of capital would be welcome to New Delhi-based Bharti Airtel, which has come under pressure to beef up its offerings ever since Ambani’s technology venture went on a deal spree to secure about $10 billion in investment from Facebook to KKR & Co. Airtel’s billionaire Chairman Sunil Mittal may be looking to leverage the diverse businesses in his empire just as Ambani goes into overdrive to transform his oil-and-petrochemicals company into an Indian e-commerce and digital payments titan with Jio Platforms.

In its 25 years of operations, Bharti Airtel has survived frequent policy changes in one of the world’s toughest telecommunications markets. It lost its position as India’s largest wireless carrier last year to Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which debuted in 2016 and shook up the industry with free calls and cheap data. The most recent blow to Bharti Airtel came in October, when the nation’s top court in a shock ruling ordered it to pay $3 billion in back fees.

The technology ambitions of Ambani, Asia’s richest man, have turned the spotlight on his telecommunications rivals, including Vodafone Idea Ltd., the struggling Indian business of British operator Vodafone Group Plc. The Financial Times reported May 28 that Alphabet Inc.’s Google is considering acquiring a stake in that venture. Vodafone Idea said it isn’t currently considering any such proposal.

Besides telecommunications, Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises has businesses spanning insurance, real estate, education and farm food.

614,2020-06-04T05:07:19+00:00,Samsung Billionaire’s Fate at Risk Despite Role in Virus Fight,"(Bloomberg) -- While technology billionaires have been among the most visible champions of the fight against Covid-19, perhaps none has as much at stake as Jay Y. Lee., Samsung’s anointed heir.

South Korea’s largest corporation and its de facto leader have been key players in one of Asia’s most successful coronavirus containment campaigns. Since March, Samsung has dispatched its own doctors to hard-hit zones, flown Korean engineers overseas via its private jet, doled out roughly $39 million worth of aid globally and played a central role in ramping up production of testing kits -- hailed by healthcare experts as a turning point in Korea’s battle against the disease.

Samsung -- the world’s largest maker of memory chips, mobile devices and electronic displays -- and its fellow conglomerates helped flatten the virus curve. But for Lee, success comes at a time of particular scrutiny. The well-publicized effort burnished his image months before the denouement of a years-long scandal and trial into alleged influence-peddling and Lee’s succession plans. In the legal clash, which inflamed resentment against Korea’s most influential conglomerates, Lee stands accused of using thoroughbred horses and other gifts to buy government support for plans to cement his family’s control over the Samsung empire -- something both Samsung and he have denied.

In a sign of how popular opinion will play into the case, Lee this week requested a public assessment of the validity of the indictment, invoking a measure allowing the formation of a civil panel to review cases. Then on Thursday, prosecutors, at risk of losing some authority, decided to seek an arrest warrant for the billionaire for alleged violations of capital market and audit laws, Yonhap News reported.

“Samsung got on the prosecutors’ nerves. The move to request an outside review is something that’s undercutting prosecutors and could enrage them,” said Chung Sun-sup, CEO at corporate research firm Chaebul.com. “Lee might have thought that he could get support from people who distrust prosecutors.”

Lee could face a prison sentence of several years in the current trial. Regardless of Covid-19, the outcome could prove a watershed moment in the sensitive relationship between the country’s corporate chieftains and government. The hearings, which will likely wrap late this year, are regarded by many observers as a litmus test for whether Korea’s courts are truly independent of the powerful business interests that hold sway over the economy.

The 51-year-old Samsung heir convened a rare press conference in May to apologize for his company’s mis-steps over succession. Swearing his children would never run the company, he pledged to give back to society and praised his fellow citizens’ dedication throughout the outbreak. “It gave me a chance to look back on our past and as a member of the business community, I feel a greater sense of responsibility,” Lee said. “I pledge to create a new Samsung that is level with the national dignity of South Korea.”

The surprise announcement drew public support from both ruling and opposition parties as well as the chairperson of the Fair Trade Commission. But critics and academics pounced on Lee’s comments as bereft of substance. That’s because it came just before a deadline set by an internal Samsung oversight body for just such an apology. The independent compliance committee, established this year after a judge in the graft trial questioned Samsung’s measures to prevent legal violations such as bribery, assessed Lee’s apology as a “meaningful” step but wanted more details.

“Samsung has never done as much in the past” to assuage critics of the conglomerates, said Kyungmook Lee, a business professor at Seoul National University. “As the largest chaebol in South Korea, the way they contributed to the nation during the Covid-19 crisis and apologized over past wrongdoings is helping soften public sentiment and improve the image of both the company and its heir.”

That’s important because suspicion of the judiciary in Korea runs deep. Over the past decade, at least half a dozen high-profile industrial magnates have been sentenced to prison for corruption, only to have those jail terms mitigated or suspended by the courts -- including Lee’s father. Even President Moon Jae-in, who swept into power on promises to clean up endemic corporate malfeasance, grappled with public outrage after a judge in Lee’s first trial unexpectedly freed him after just a year in prison. In suspending Lee’s sentence, the judge concluded the billionaire couldn’t resist requests from a sitting president and that the greater responsibility lay with public officials. Park Geun-hye, who was impeached in 2017, has denied taking any money for herself.

Paranoia about chaebols’ influence continues to dog the second phase of Lee’s hearings, which commenced late last year after the Supreme Court overturned the lower court’s decision to suspend the mogul’s sentence and ordered a retrial. Lee’s hearing has been delayed for months as prosecutors argue that one of the appeals court judges overseeing the current case is biased and inclined to go lightly on Lee. The justice in question has shown a flair for the dramatic by, among other things, lecturing the executive at length in October on how he can better run Samsung, advising him to take inspiration from Israeli businesses. The appeals court judge has so far kept out of the fray.

“In South Korea, the public opinion often influences trials and sways verdicts,” said Heo Pil-seok, chief executive officer at Midas International Asset Management. “While Samsung’s facing several critical situations, it’s trying to make a plea for clemency to the public,” he said, referring to not just its Covid-19 efforts but also Lee’s apology.

Samsung and Lee’s approach to the sudden flare-up of the novel coronavirus was in many ways no different than his peers’. Noted philanthropists Bill Gates and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma donated millions or offered technical assistance. Others like Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos, faced with public criticism that their companies are placing workers in jeopardy, focused their efforts on protecting the workforce. And tech corporations joined manufacturers around the globe in trying to plug a shortfall in ventilators and masks.

Samsung representatives emphasized that the company’s main goal was to combat the disease, save lives and protect employees, and dismissed any suggestion they were connected to the hearing. In addition to dispatching personnel, the company also converted a training facility near Daegu into a treatment center, helped expedite business entries into China, even handed out free smartphones to quarantined patients.

“Samsung Electronics is joining the global fight against COVID-19 to safeguard the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and local communities,” it said in a statement. “The smart factory program and other global relief initiatives by Samsung Electronics have nothing to do with the ongoing legal proceedings over the case of Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee. Our efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus have always been to help our employees and their families that have been impacted by this pandemic as we are all in this together.”

Samsung plays an unusually crucial role in Korea’s economy and national ethos. Its transformation from economic minnow to technology export powerhouse owes much to its family-run conglomerates. Known as chaebol -- which means “wealth clique” -- these pillars of the nation’s “miracle economy” encompass household names like LG, Hyundai and SK. They’ve supported government initiatives for decades, spearheading a modernization effort that’s created world leaders in shipping, steel, and now technology and electronics.

Largest of them all is Samsung. The 82-year-old conglomerate is both a symbol of the Asian country’s technological and diplomatic rise as well as a touchstone for what many think is wrong with the economy today -- the overwhelming dominance of a handful of dynasties who call the shots in everything from cars to phones.

“Samsung’s striving to overhaul its image to win a positive trial ruling,” said Chae Yibai, a former opposition lawmaker and a long-time corporate governance activist, referring to the months-long virus campaign. “The entire process is like a play, with a judge taking on the role of director and the compliance committee acting as a sub-director. The leading man is Lee.”

South Korea’s Chaebol, Engines of Growth and Scandal: QuickTake

In the current drama, Lee’s star is on the rise. His approval ratings in independent surveys have climbed since the conglomerate, heeding the government’s call, swung into action in March. The top keywords in domestic internet searches covering Lee from January to April were “virus” or “management,” according to surveyor Global Bigdata Research, pushing out trial-related terms among the top 30.

He’s even won over some of the smaller businesses that’ve traditionally played second fiddle to the chaebols. Local mask manufacturer E&W said its output increased about 50% after it adopted Samsung’s solutions in its facility setup and distribution. Samsung also dispatched about 10 experts to each of four test-kit makers to instruct their engineers on how to ramp up volumes while resolving bottlenecks through automation. “Keeping a sound ecosystem of SMEs is essential to Samsung as well as for the long-term benefits of all economic players,” said Junha Park, head of Samsung’s smart factory operation team.

Lee’s approval rating in surveys conducted by the Global Bigdata have risen in 2020 since the outbreak. They fell to 9.77% in the two days after his public apology, down from an average of 16.37% over the 30 days prior. But negative views also plummeted to 20.6% from 44.2%, while those on the fence shot up to 72.8% from 39.4%. That latter point is key.

“Credibility is very important,” said Daniel Yoo, head of global investment at Yuanta Securities Korea. “Clearly the corporate image, about Samsung and South Korea, has been improving.”

Chaebol Backlash Loses Bite as Jailed Execs Walk Free: QuickTake

The most immediate challenge for Samsung is empowering and keeping its de facto leader free during an era of heightened uncertainty. Regardless of the personal outcome of that trial, the longer-term perceptions of chaebols may hinge on Lee’s promise to corporatize Samsung. Some view his vision as the first step in finally reining in the chaebols, by breaking decades-old succession lines. Others suspect Samsung will find some other way to safeguard the Lee family’s control. That’s because it’s not up to Lee, but to the company’s shareholders and board, said Shin Se-don, an emeritus professor of economics at Sookmyung Women’s University.

“The apology was unlike Samsung,” said Shin, who worked at Samsung’s research institute in the late 1980s. “After Lee’s announcement, ruling and opposition parties both suggested Lee could be legally excused. That’s different from what most people think.”

615,2020-06-03T07:00:00+00:00,Next Gen Bango Technology Grows Active Customers for du,"Bango (AIM: BGO), the mobile commerce company, announces that deploying its payment optimization technology has enabled du, the leading UAE mobile operator, to grow its active carrier billing customer base.

Growing the number of customers that activate and use Direct Carrier Billing (DCB), a one-click method of charging purchases to the user’s mobile phone bill, is a powerful way for operators to capture more value from the consumption of ""OTT"" content and services, for example from app stores.

Using Bango technology, the du customers who wanted to spend in the Google Play store using carrier billing were identified, and targeted with a DCB re-engagement message. This enabled the customer to activate DCB within a pre-approved credit limit. The risk was that the customers who could not pay on their du phone bill would switch to a non-DCB payment method, losing the benefits of one-click payment, and reducing the percentage of du subscribers that enrol to use carrier billing. Within two weeks of launching the campaign, 20% of the segment had re-engaged and made at least one purchase with carrier billing.

Baseil Zaki, Head of Value Added Services, Devices & Loyalty, du Consumer Services commented:""du works hard to enhance and expand the services we offer our customers, providing the best experience across a range of leading OTT services. Bango is a long term, trusted partner du uses to power these services, which include Google Play and Amazon Prime. The success we have experienced with the latest Bango technology is significant, we are excited to apply this technology to activate and grow new audiences for our mobile commerce offerings.""

Jim Plimmer, SVP Payment Products Strategy and Sales at Bango commented:""Bango technology combines payment data insights with smart marketing technology to enable mobile operators and merchants to get the right message, to the right user, at the right time. This combination provides a powerful route to attract and grow the active user base.""

616,2020-05-20T22:00:03+00:00,The Robots-Are-Taking-Our-Jobs Threat Gets Real,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If there was ever a good time for the robots-taking-over-jobs argument, this may be it. Not just because factory owners don’t want to pay for rising labor costs, but because workers don’t want to gather every day in petri dishes.

Chinese manufacturing is facing a challenge since employees returned to production lines: keeping them on the job. Some companies reported a 90% turnover in workforce after the economy started reopening in March, compared to 25% to 30% in a normal, pre-coronavirus year. Such spikes are expected worldwide as lockdowns ease. The pandemic has made “humans the risk to continued operations” in supply chains, note analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Leave aside how businesses reopen. The bigger question is, how will they be thinking about the future of their factories?

Re-enter the robot, or more precisely, automation, a trend that was already alarming labor advocates and will be aggravated by Covid-19. Nascent signs from the order books of industry giants like Fanuc Corp., Keyence Corp. and Harmonic Drive Systems Inc. point to businesses wanting to get their operations up and running – increasingly, without humans.Industrial robot exports from Japan, the heartland of automation machinery, grew to some parts of the world from the previous year. Fanuc, maker of robots used in factories for companies ranging from Apple Inc. to Amazon.com Inc., saw orders in the fourth quarter to March climb 7%. Its revenues in the U.S. and China rose, while inventories of components ticked down as demand edged up. Bookings also increased for Harmonic Drive, which makes parts for small robots. This interest was manifested while the world was consumed by the initial shock wave of Covid-19, suggesting how big a priority automation has become.

There’s room for robots. Worldwide, density remains low as many companies have had little desire to deal with integrating them into operations, or in triggering politically sensitive social backlash. Still, nearly 60% of production work globally is in areas that can easily be automated. In China, almost 40% of jobs are machine replaceable. Differences across and within industries matter — robots do most of the stamping and welding in car factories, while humans conduct final inspections. Tasks requiring significant dexterity remain difficult for machines.A big change in the Covid-19 era may be the lowering of barriers to adoption, which have largely come down to attitude. South Korea and Germany can be held out as positive examples that have achieved high factory-automation levels while keeping unemployment low. A more pointed prod, though, may be simple necessity, which has driven most big changes in the way we use technology. The global health emergency has hamstrung companies in a way most never expected. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC of almost 300 chief financial officers found that they didn’t get what they needed to make informed decisions and response times were delayed. More automation could improve agility. While most CFOs of industrial production companies surveyed plan to cancel or defer investments, only 15% are planning to cut investments for automation, artificial intelligence and industrial internet-of-things.

Story continues

The post-coronavirus dilemma looks like the old one, but worse. The world will need more productivity, and automation is a way to get it. In Germany, deploying robots led to an increase of gross domestic product per capita of 0.5% over 10 years. But what will happen to displaced, less-skilled workers? The pandemic could reduce working hours by 6.7% across the world, equivalent to 195 million full-time workers, according to the International Labour Organization. For now, governments are offering wage subsidies to businesses to retain employees. The onus will eventually also fall on companies to reskill and accommodate their workers. Separately, governments are incentivizing the transition to the robotic future. Japan wants companies to bring supply chains home from China. Where there aren’t enough skilled workers, more machines will be needed to collaborate – or so-called Cobots. In China itself, industrial subsidies that support automation loom large. “New infrastructure” has become a way to justify fiscal stimulus that will put billions of dollars toward 5G and other technologies that will employ far fewer people.

This doesn’t mean the end of productive human labor, or the loss of jobs en masse. It does require more openness to exploring options in addition to, and beyond, people. The reality is, companies that invest in automating processes now are likely to come out faster – and perhaps stronger — on the other side. Not only because robots won’t be sick or afraid in the petri dish, but because the future of work is changing. No one wanted the Covid-19 experiment. But companies and people have to come to terms with it.

618,2020-05-15T18:28:03+00:00,Urbem's 'Quality Strategy' Series: Cash Is King,"""Cash is king"" has been one of the most frequently taught lessons throughout the history of our stock market, and it cannot be stressed enough in these times. Indeed, cash flow is the lifeblood of a business and ultimately determines the valuation. How, then, do we gauge the quality of a company from the perspective of cash generation? Here are some of the metrics that we at Urbem find useful to concentrate on.

Free cash conversion rate

This ratio measures how much free cash flow a business can generate out of one dollar of earnings and indicates the quality of the company's accounting profit. We generally look for a consistently high figure here year in and year out. It would be very rare for a business to deliver a free cash conversion rate above 100% every year over an extended period of time (e.g., a decade). However, it is certainly possible. Some common scenarios include:

1) The company manages to receive cash payment early from its customers

2) The company manages to pay its suppliers late

3) The company can cover some of its staff costs with non-cash instruments (e.g., stock options).

Scenarios 1 and 2 are strong indicators of a solid business model with strong bargaining power. One example of this is the membership model at Rightmove (LSE:RMV).

CapEx margin

Investors should also be interested in how much capital expenditure is usually required to sustain the operations and expansion at the company. We calculate the CapEx margin as the typical amount of capital expenditure needed to be put back into the business as the percentage of the sales. This way, the metric can be compared with the free cash flow margin.

We look for the CapEx margin to be significantly lower than the free cash flow margin, signaling that the business delivers more cash for its owners than for itself. Take a look at capital-intensive Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), for example, which generates a 10.5% CapEx margin and a 7.4% free cash flow margin, as compared to asset-light Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), which has a 2.4% CapEx margin and an 11.4% free cash flow margin. We thus believe shareholders should be happier with the situation at Domino's, as it keeps less than three cents to itself but allocates more than 11 cents to its shareholders.

Story continues

Cash conversion cycle

This metric expresses the number of days that it takes for a business to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. The lower the figure, the more efficient the company is concerning cash generation.

Aconsistently negative cash conversion cycle is rare but possible. For instance, it can occur if the business manages to pay its suppliers later than when it gets paid from its customers. Two prominent examples of this model are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

619,2020-05-12T10:43:29+00:00,Not Just Fun And Games: How Esports Could Offer Potential Investment Opportunities,"Like to play Fortnite or League of Legends? You’re in good company, because esports have become hugely popular. And esports investing and esports stocks have benefited.

Gaming and esports have grown rapidly—driven by consumer demand, new distribution strategies, and new technology, according to research firm GlobalData. Gaming has transformed into a service model rather than just a product model. As that interest has grown, so has interest in esports investing.

Like everything else, esports have been affected by the sudden, global spread of the novel coronavirus. ESPN.com reported that dozens of live esports tournaments, such as Dota Pro Circuit, have been canceled or postponed indefinitely. Some events that were supposed to be held in stadiums, such as League of Legends, have moved online to support social distancing guidelines.

The Meteoric Rise of Esports

Before the global outbreak of COVID-19, games and esports analytics firm Newzoo forecast that global esports would top $1 billion in 2020 for the first time, with China being the top market and North America close behind. That’s an estimated year-on-year growth of 15.7% for 2020. The firm has yet to update those figures, but they’ll likely change.

At the time, China was expected to be the largest market by revenue, with total revenues of $385.1 million in 2020, followed by North America, with total revenues of $252.8 million, the firm estimated.

Industry watchers will wait and see how the cancellations of some games and the move to put other tournaments online will affect the business. Online platforms such as Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and YouTube, owned by Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), are making it easier for people to consume esports videos and events by allowing esports streamers to broadcast gameplay, according to Influencer Marketing Hub. The firm cited data from TwitchTracker, which shows Twitch has seen an increase in the number of people who watch live streams on the platform—rising to 1.28 million in 2019 from 591,809 in 2016.

Story continues

MarTech Series, citing a late March report by GlobalData, sees streaming platforms benefiting from this push to online viewing. Brands that advertise during esports games—such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)—and have hosted esports events for years will likely increase their online ad buys and shift some of the ad spending they could have done at in-person tournaments. That shift in support might benefit the streaming platforms, while the organizers of these games may see their ad revenues fall sharply.

Before the virus outbreak, consulting group McKinsey & Co. noted that brands such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) were getting into core sponsorship. Advertisers have discovered that esports could be an even more attractive branding medium than traditional sports thanks to the interactivity of livestreaming. McKinsey noted that so far, there are few ads, so there’s not too much competition. Streamers are willing to wear, consume, and endorse sponsors’ products while broadcasting.

Depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it’s possible that the media rights these platforms buy from organizers could rise sharply in coming years. So these platforms may try to strike long-term deals with event organizers, GlobalData explained.

How to Invest in Esports

Even though COVID-19 has upended the sector, gaming doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. There are a few ways to invest in esports, whether directly in esports stocks or ETFs, or indirectly through technology firms or brands big in the space.

Citing data from the third quarter of 2019, Newzoo said that the top 10 public companies by games revenue made a combined $21.5 billion, which is a year-on-year growth of 7.5%, slightly higher than the growth rate in the first half of 2019. However, it was under the 11% growth rate seen year-over-year.

Newzoo said the companies that saw the greatest year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2019 included GOOGL, Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), Tencent Holdings, Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTWO). TTWO saw 74% year-over-year growth, with revenues rising to nearly $1 billion. It was the third quarter’s fastest grower, while growth numbers for GOOGL and AAPL over the past 12 months through the quarter were 28% and 16%, respectively.

GlobalData reported that much of the innovation is coming through companies involved in 5G, cloud gaming, and the artificial reality/virtual reality space. Many semiconductor companies have hands in those high-growth interrelated areas, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX). And don’t forget cloud computing platforms. In addition to AMZN and GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a significant platform.

In the March report reflecting the pandemic’s impact, GlobalData pointed out that online viewership of esports tournaments has grown significantly. The research firm cited information supplied by Gen.G that it saw an 18% increase in viewership for its PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and League of Legends teams on Chinese streaming platforms in early 2020, when the Chinese government locked down most of the country.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's live market coverage. Now, the coronavirus outbreak has upended US equities trading. The New York Stock Exchange has closed its trading floor, and the NASDAQ has closed its option floor in Philadelphia. Now, all of this happening, of course, as we've seen market volatility spikes.

So let's get more on this. And for that, we have Nelson Griggs, president of the NASDAQ stock exchange. And Nelson, thanks so much for taking the time to join the show this afternoon. We're excited to have you on. I guess let's start with-- give us a sense of what the last two months have been like with your entire operations working remotely.

NELSON GRIGGS: Sure, well thanks for having me. So historically, we are about a 4% work from home and very quickly went to a 98% work from home. If you think about the exchange's responsibility, though, we have been through shutdowns before over Sandy, et cetera. But most of the BCP planning, the backup planning, is thought about in terms of days and weeks, not globally for months. So we did very quickly put plans in place. We were pretty early on this because of what we saw happening with our operations in Hong Kong.

So we have been incredibly resilient, I think not just NASDAQ but the entire Street. I think we all feared the worst, in terms of what it would be like to work from home. And it has been really-- from a market operations, obviously there's a lot of volatility, but it's been really seamless.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, can you talk about-- I mean, at a time when there's so much uncertainty and there's so much volatility in the markets, it's spooking a lot of investors out there. What kind of relief measures are you providing to listed companies at this point?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think the one thing that comes up in times like this, and we saw this as well in the financial crisis, is companies that are on what we call more of the smaller cap end of the range, concerned about rules around having that minimum dollar bid price, minimum market values. And the SEC has been great to work with. Both ourselves as well as the competing exchanges have come up with plans that have been very-- the SEC has been very receptive to give temporary relief for those companies with the idea is that this is probably more of a temporary downturn and then we'll come back. And we saw that in the financial crisis.

Story continues

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Nelson, you talk about the fact that it could be a temporary downturn. We have shifted our focus almost, or I guess the direction of our conversation recently, talking about people getting back to work, the return to work here, and the potential return to-- I don't know if we want to put it in quotes, but what normalcy will look like going forward. What do you think that could look like?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think what's interesting to us is-- so we do operate in over 30 countries. So it is a very country by country, even-- and then you get to the US, it's state by state. There's a lot of local regulations and rules to figure out about what we actually can do with our employee base. So it's going to be gradual.

We are fortunate. Our business is very resilient, so we're not forced to go back early, by any means. But our hope is that we see gradual returning to work with a lot of precautionary measures around temperature testing, social distancing. The biggest thing to figure out early are transportation-- public transportation and how do you get a workforce to work?

So it's a daily call we have with our executive leadership team to talk about how that could look, but I think we all have to be understanding that it's going to take some time and it's going to be gradual and we should expect it to be-- you know, have a bit of a lumpy effect.

SEANA SMITH: Hey Nelson, so when we talk about returning to work, some of the questions I guess that have been raised I've been reading about is whether or not US exchange trading floors are still going to be relevant post-coronavirus. I know the NASDAQ in particular, it's mostly remote trading. You mostly do it all online. But what are your thoughts on that, just in terms of what we could expect going forward and what will be necessary going forward?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think we'd separate the equities market from the options market. There's unique components of the options market. We still see value in a floor. But it's pretty clear during this time with the equities market, most of the volume today is happening away from a floor environment, as is we measure the quality of trading. And we do feel that NASDAQ does electronic trading the best in the world. But electronic trading better serves investors because there's not really that conflict of interests that we see in the floor-based models for equities.

So you know, we'll see how the floor-based markets-- there's really only one left, how it comes back. But I think at this time, investors are actually being served very well with tight spreads, liquidity, and we're seeing the markets operate very, very efficiently.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, I want to hear your thoughts on the IPO market because it's come to nearly a standstill over the last several weeks. So how do you think-- or how has coronavirus reshaped the 2020 IPO timeline?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, well, it certainly has reshaped it. It hasn't come to a complete stop. We have had six health care companies, biotechs go public, and we do believe we'll have more. And there actually is a small pipeline developing of companies that were on the cusp of going public in February and March that still have an active dialogue going about a June, July timeframe.

But clearly, the biggest challenge for a companies when you do go public is you need to forecast your-- you know, your financials for the remainder of the year, the coming year, and that's gotten very hard for many businesses. So we still think there can be an IPO market.

That's part of the reason why you see health care being successful is because the lack of need for forecasting. They're talking about, you know, two years, four years, five years down the road for developing drugs. But we do think we'll start seeing the IPO market open up a bit in June, July, August, but be fairly slow. And then we do think it'll pick up more robustly as the year progresses. There's a lot of companies would like to go.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Nelson, you mentioned the fact that you've had six companies go public. How are you facilitating those virtual IPOs. What exactly does that process look like at this point?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, that's a great question. So as mentioned, we've been incredibly impressed with our partners, the trading firms, the banks that do trade through NASDAQ. So they can really operate as they do today. NASDAQ operates, as we always have-- we provide a very robust tools-- toolkit to companies, investors to go public-- or sorry, the trading desks. And we have our team that does that. So that that's been very, very fluid.

The challenge for companies is if you think about what a roadshow used to be, it used to be going for eight days to all these different cities on planes. And now it's usually been four days on video. But I would say the deals that have come out have all been received very, very well. They've traded well. And I think that companies were able to get their message across, you know, clearly enough to drive that investor demand, so different but also surprisingly successful.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, real quick, in your line of work as the president of the NASDAQ stock exchange, you talk to a lot of executives because it's in your line of business. What are you hearing from these CEOs? What are you hearing from these executives, just about their outlook over the next couple of months?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, and I think we look-see a little bit that's developing actually in the market in performance. It clearly has been a market where technology, health care have done very well. The averages there-- the NASDAQ 100, the NASDAQ composite, the biotech-- are actually positive now for the year. Clearly, value stocks in certain sectors have been hit very hard.

So I think you do need to look at the market, look at companies on a very individualist basis. What does their sector look like? But clearly, everyone says a lot of consistent themes. They think about their employees, their health, their safety and well-being.

And then depending on which side of the market they're on, it's either how do I accelerate through this and find new opportunities? For some, they're thinking about, OK, I need to really conserve cash, find cash, and prepare myself for, you know, a handful more quarters or even a year or so, what's going to be a slower market for their businesses.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Nelson Griggs, president of the NASDAQ stock exchange, thanks so much for joining me today.

621,2020-05-06T22:00:36+00:00,Crazy Trading on China's Nasdaq Has Its Own Logic,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Old habits die hard. China’s Nasdaq-like ChiNext board has staged a comeback this year, rallying 17% to trade at an average of — yes, really — 70 times earnings. Is this misguided enthusiasm by an investor base that infamously engineered a stomach-churning crash just five years ago?

All the conventional wisdom points to irrationality. The ChiNext is composed mostly of young, small and volatile enterprises, whereas blue chips are far better placed to weather the coronavirus outbreak. First-quarter earnings reports from China’s domestically listed companies just drove home the point.

The data show an irrefutable connection between market value and earnings resilience. Companies with a market cap of more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) increased their sales and operating profit at the median, despite the virus-related lockdowns. By contrast, the median smaller company recorded a double-digit decline in earnings.

What’s surprising, though, is that not all earnings for ChiNext members are bad. The new-economy market is a story of ice and fire. While more than half of companies reported a drop in net income, almost a quarter posted earnings growth of at least 30%. In other words, performance was either sub-zero or very hot, with little in between.

That makes the ChiNext an attractive market for stock pickers who fancy they can pick the hot prospects from the frozen waste. This makes sense for investors, since China has no equivalent of the FANGs — the mega-cap technology stocks that have made the U.S. equity market the world’s best performer. In China, the well-loved large caps are in booze and drugs — and these are already richly valued and crowded.

A case in point is Kweichow Moutai Co., maker of the fiery liquor known as baijiu and the world’s most valuable distiller. Moutai’s 1.6 trillion yuan market value is now equal to the entire gross domestic product of Guizhou province, where the company is based. How much upside can there be left for an alcohol producer whose basic product costs just shy of 2,400 yuan, or close to $340 a a bottle? That’s more than the minimum monthly wage in China’s capital, Beijing. Unlike FANG members Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc., Moutai surely can't be considered a play on middle-class consumption.

Story continues

Chinese investors also have a different vision of value. For them, value isn’t about cheap metrics such as low price-to-book or price-earnings ratios. Rather, it’s determined by how fast a small cap can morph into a blue chip. This explains why investors love Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., which supplies batteries to Tesla Inc. They hope it can become as indispensable to Elon Musk’s electric-car maker as Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. did to Apple Inc.

To be sure, this is all risky business. Beijing recently approved plans to move to a registration-based system for initial public offerings on ChiNext. That means a flood of new companies with even less vetting will be arriving on the board. It’s also worth noting that the quarterly earnings of these young and inexperienced companies aren’t audited.

But then traders on ChiNext aren’t buying stocks so much as options. They’re sifting for China’s future FANGs.

622,2020-05-06T10:00:00+00:00,One-Man Hedge Fund Gains 56% With Virus-Resistant Tech Bets,"(Bloomberg) --

Isolation is old hat for Eric Jackson. Since he launched his technology-focused hedge fund in 2017, he has been running it from a home office.

The pandemic requires little adjustment in how he works. But it does force investors everywhere to think about which companies will do better in a scarred global economy. In Jackson’s case, the crisis has given his key holdings a huge boost: Zoom Video Communications Inc. and German food app company Delivery Hero SE have lifted his long-short fund at EMJ Capital Ltd. to a 56% gain this year.

Jackson tries to hunt down data on technology usage that will lead him to winners. On Feb. 3, more than a month before the virus was declared a pandemic, Jackson noticed a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China. He already owned the stock because he liked its video conferencing technology and its CEO. The China numbers persuaded him to double down.

“They are a verb. You don’t see too many verbs in the tech space. When one comes along like Google, you would have been wise to plunk down an investment and stick with it and I think the same is going to be the case for Zoom,” he said. Zoom shares have more than doubled this year.

Hedge funds were hit hard by client withdrawals and investment losses during the March market rout, with global hedge fund assets dropping below $3 trillion for the first time in six years. In Canada, only five of 61 hedge funds tracked by Venator Capital Management Ltd. posted gains in the first quarter of the year.

Listening in Silicon Valley

Jackson runs one long-short fund, which has about $61 million in assets and is up 131% since inception in October 2017, as of Tuesday’s close. It typically owns about 11 to 20 stocks and has a similar number of short positions. Options are part of the strategy: the fund held out-of-the-money put options against some indices that rose sharply in value during the sell-off of late February and March as investors sought to buy protection against further declines.

Story continues

On the long side, “I’m trying to find companies that I think have a good shot at doubling or tripling over the next two to three years and I typically want to hold them for that long,” he said. As is common in funds that focus on tech growth stocks, there can be high day-to-day volatility.

In normal times, he travels regularly to San Francisco and Silicon Valley to meet with contacts he’s built over decades after working in the tech industry himself. From 2000 to 2004, he worked at Toronto-based VoiceGenie Technologies Inc., a voice-recognition firm acquired by Alcatel for an undisclosed sum in 2006.

“If I start to hear the same name come up over and over again, that’s usually a good sign that the company is just on the cusp of something great,” Jackson said. “So I’m getting behind those companies early, sticking with them, not just sort of selling out quickly.”

Twilio Inc. was his biggest winner in 2018 after hearing about the company through friends and contacts. Shares of the San Francisco-based software maker rose 278% in 2018 and climbed another 10% last year as quarterly results kept beating expectations.

He replaced Twilio in his fund with Delivery Hero and HelloFresh SE, a seller of meal kits. Both have been big contributors to his fund’s surge this year.

“I was into them from last year. But when the pandemic kind of began to emerge and they canceled the NBA season, that was really the first time I realized that this was going to be a be a much bigger deal than I expected at the beginning of the year,” said Jackson, a Brooklyn Nets fan.

Internet Dinosaurs

Jackson is also betting that EBay Inc. makes a comeback after buying shares last quarter.

“It lost the war to Amazon, yet they have a bunch of interesting catalysts that I think are going to play out this year.”

With a new CEO on board, former Walmart Inc. e-commerce executive Jamie Iannone, the company could see some renewed revenue growth, Jackson said. Iannone started as head of the company last month.

EBay recently sold ticket-resale site StubHub for $4.05 billion and is in the midst of evaluating offers for its classified ads business. Jackson, who has been an activist investor in Yahoo and Viacom, hopes EBay will use its cash for acquisitions.

“There’s a turnaround story there that people aren’t paying attention to because it’s this boring dinosaur of a company.” He sees EBay’s share price rising to $100 over the next six to 18 months. EBay’s stock closed at $40.32 on Tuesday.

Health Tech

Putting his “citizen hat” on, Jackson is pessimistic that the reopening of economies will go smoothly as bankruptcies hit small businesses and energy companies. But the pandemic will lead to big changes in health care and technology, he predicts.

“I think there’s an opportunity for other devices to keep track of people’s health and connect to the hospitals so you don’t have to travel in and your doctors can have this remote relationship with you,” he said.

He owns shares of DexCom Inc., which develops devices to monitor blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Jackson’s son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a few years ago and that’s how he came across the company. “They keep making these devices smaller and lighter, less obtrusive and less expensive so I think they are an interesting company to watch.”

He also owns Livongo Health Inc., a U.S.-focused remote health monitoring company. The shares have gained 75% this year, while DexCom is up 67%.

The company said it would decide a new one when the longer-term impact of the crisis became clear.

At the end of March, Bpost had said it expected its full-year group operating income to grow by a low single-digit percentage, with adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) between 240 and 270 million euros.

The group, which provides mail deliveries, parcel and e-commerce logistics, reported adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 75.6 million euros for the first quarter, a 21% drop on the previous year, but beating company-provided consensus estimates of 74.2 million euros.

SAO PAULO, May 4 (Reuters) - Brazil's battered retailers are starting to reopen after weeks of coronavirus lockdown but may exit the crisis transformed, with the e-commerce sector strengthened and brick-and-mortar chains facing an uphill path to normality.

That is potential good news for major local online retailers B2W Companhia Digital SA, Magazine Luiza SA and Via Varejo SA, despite increasing competition from international players Mercado Libre and Amazon.com in Latin America's largest market.

All still have room to grow their marketplace platforms for at least two more years, said Thiago Macruz, retail and e-commerce analyst at Itaú BBA, who said the rising migration of customers to online shopping is likely to overshadow economic headwinds.

Shares in B2W, which operates under brands like Submarino and Americanas.com, have risen more than 16% so far this year, outperforming an almost 30% slump in Brazil's benchmark index Ibovespa and rivals Magazine Luiza and Via Varejo, which own more than 1,000 brick-and-mortar stores each.

""Amazon has not yet challenged its local rivals because its organic strategy in Brazil is not so capital-intensive, but they have deep pockets to change the competitive scenario here whenever they want,"" Macruz added.

Brazil's online sales growth accelerated to 30% in the past five weeks, according to local e-commerce association ABComm, with stay-at-home measures luring consumers and pushing retailers to migrate online.

The group estimates that 80,000 online platforms have been launched since March, while the number of customers shopping via the internet grew by almost 1 million.

""Looking back, we see that in Brazil like everywhere else, e-commerce has never stopped growing regardless of economic hardships,"" ABComm's president, Maurício Salvador, said in a phone interview.

He noted, however, that online sales may slow from the pace seen in March and April as looming unemployment curbs consumption and a political crisis further rattles confidence.

Story continues

ABComm has kept its initial 2020 growth forecast at 18% to 106 billion reais ($19.50 billion).

A BUMPY ROAD

Mall-based retailers that sell apparel and other goods face a bumpier road. Department store operator Lojas Renner SA , Brazil's largest fast-fashion retailer, has seen shares slump some 30% this year.

Only 60 of Brazil's 577 malls have reopened, and the tenant stores of all 577 malls are estimated to have lost 20 billion reais ($3.51 billion) in sales since the onset of the pandemic, industry association Abrasce said. Another 13 malls were expected to resume activities by May 4, according to Abrasce.

""We adopted some new protocols but customer flow is still well below levels seen in the same period a year ago,"" Abrasce's president, Glauco Humai, said.

Demand is unlikely to recover to pre-pandemic levels this year, said Victor Beyruti, economist at brokerage Guide.

""Being the first one to reopen has its advantages, but this move must be carefully thought out,"" he said. ""If even China has taken a while to see demand recover, here this should take even longer,"" Beyruti warned.

Mall operators are in talks with state-run development bank BNDES to create a credit line to help them overcome the crisis after renouncing 1.5 billion reais in rent payments from their tenants so far.

Upscale operator Iguatemi Empresa de Shopping Centers SA is cutting spending on expenditures like renovations by 40% this year and others may follow.

""We have been working quite hard to reduce our spending and grant discounts to ease (tenants') cash restraints in April and May,"" Iguatemi's chief financial officer, Cristina Betts, said in a recent call with analysts.

Iguatemi has reopened a single outlet mall in the southern state of Santa Catarina, one of the first to relax social-distancing measures. Rival Multiplan has also only resumed activities in one mall in southern Brazil and expects unemployment to weigh on sales this year.

625,2020-04-28T05:30:15+00:00,Don’t Blame Amazon for Cleaning Up in Lockdown,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amazon.com Inc. has come under pressure in a locked-down Europe for doing what it does best: selling consumers everything they need.

An appeals court in France on Friday said the U.S. online retailing giant must limit its range to essential items: food, health products and computer equipment. In Germany, competition authorities are monitoring the company after complaints from retailers. It has endured strikes over working conditions in Italy. The grievances differ in each country, and Amazon is contesting them.

But the crisis has also cast the defects of its brick-and-mortar competitors into sharp relief. Amazon appears to be dominating partly because of years of missteps from its rivals on Main Street, as well as the company’s sheer brazenness. Where traditional retailers have been cautious about putting staff at risk or appearing insensitive to the health-care crisis, Amazon has carried on filling orders as best as it can.

Some online-savvy competitors have also done well. But no one has matched the e-commerce behemoth’s ability to supply homebound consumers with a similarly wide selection and dependable service. And in this unsettling time, everyone’s definition of an urgent essential item is slightly different, spanning books and extension cords to electric toothbrushes and Pilates mats.

Other retailers erred on the side of caution when it came to the various national patchworks of lockdown rules.

For example, government guidance in the U.K. about which retailers should shut their physical doors was inconsistent. While bicycle shops could stay open, those selling electronics were forced to close. Even in sectors allowed to keep operating, some retailers, such as Kingfisher Plc’s home-improvement chain B&Q, closed shops to protect employees and customers. (It has since reopened 215 stores.) Online, retailers in Britain also faced fits and starts. Some temporarily limited their ranges to handle panic buying. Drugstore operator Boots, owned by U.S. giant Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., did so to meet the frenzy for paracetamol and hand sanitizer.

Story continues

While understandable in many cases, and admirable in some, every instance where a company shut its doors or restricted available merchandise simply handed another advantage to Amazon.

The picture is slightly different in the U.S., where a wider range of retailers has kept trading. Not only were Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. able to continue selling general merchandise alongside food, they also benefited from their investments in e-commerce. Target said last week that its digital sales in April had risen by more than 275%.

Even as others have benefited from the heightened demand, Amazon has some massive supply chain advantages. It’s not just the dominance of the company’s 175 fulfillment centers with their combined 150 million square feet of space dotted around the world. It’s also the efficiency with which that space and its contents are managed: Amazon relies heavily on automation both to whizz products around its warehouses, and to order the stock for them. In the book “Always Day One,” the journalist Alex Kantrowitz explained how Amazon uses its 25 years of data on customer orders to predict demand in any particular zip code.

Traditionally, a so-called “vendor manager” would work with a brand to decide how much of a given product — Kantrowitz uses the example of Tide detergent — to stock at a given warehouse. Back in 2012, Amazon started developing an automated solution to determine what products were needed, the quantity, and the price. That resulted in a system it dubbed “Hands off the Wheel,” where humans play a far more limited role in managing stock; each vendor manager is now responsible for tens of thousands products, compared with several hundred a few years back.

A system like that comes into its own during the current crisis — ensuring that warehouses are replete with the products they’re most likely to need. It might also explain the company’s decision to extend the temporary closing of its warehouses in France in response to the court’s ruling: Unpicking its vastly complex automated stocking operations to focus on a few discrete products is surely incredibly difficult, though not impossible.

For competitors, replicating the Amazon approach is a tricky task, particularly in a condensed time frame. And retailers’ caution over how to handle the virus was understandable. Reputations will be won or lost on how companies behaved during the crisis.

While criticism of Amazon’s working practices has popped up around the world, it continues to hoover up customer dollars. Call it the Ryanair effect. The airline last year came dead last in Which? magazine’s annual customer satisfaction survey for the sixth time in a row. Yet its 10 billion-euro ($10.8 billion) market capitalization still makes it bigger than Deutsche Lufthansa AG and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group combined. Amazon’s business too seems immune to criticism, though it doesn’t have Ryanair’s customer satisfaction issues.

Its popularity should endure when the world returns to some semblance of normality. For a variety of reasons — avoidance of crowds, for one — many of the sales made online during the pandemic won’t return to brick-and-mortar stores even when they open back up. This year’s jump in U.S. online retail sales, including groceries, to about 17.2% of overall sales, from 13.9% in 2019, will effectively condense two years’ growth into one, according to GlobalData. In the U.K., the proportion of online sales reached a record 22.3% in March, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Amazon’s performance during the pandemic means it will be in pole position to capture the extra spending via a click of a mouse or tap of a smartphone. Speed and ease make up for a lot of sins.

626,2020-04-28T01:25:11+00:00,"Google, Starbucks, AMD earnings: What to know in markets Tuesday","Earnings season kicks into high gear Tuesday. A slew of big names will deliver quarterly results, but the spotlight will be on Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) after the closing bell.

Alphabet is expected to report adjusted earnings of $13.97 per share on $32.56 billion in revenue during its first quarter. The tech giant’s results could be negatively impacted by its exposure to the travel industry, which accounts for approximately 11% of search and revenue. Ad revenue will have likely taken a hit amid COVID-19, but Alphabet’s cloud business could remain a bright spot, according to analysts.

“We believe Street estimates for Q1 are likely optimistic, given the material pullback in ad spend due to COVID-19. Management commentary on near-term Ad Revenue outlook will be key,” RBC analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note April 24.

So far this year, Alphabet shares are down 4%, while the broader market declined 10%. In the same period, Facebook (FB) sank 6%, Netflix (NFLX) soared 31%, Amazon (AMZN) jumped 30% and Apple (AAPL) fell 3%.

Coffee giant Starbucks is estimated to report adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share on $5.90 billion in revenue during its fiscal second quarter.

Starbucks provided a business update on April 8 and outlined the impact that it had seen as a result of COVID-19. At the time, the company said that same-store sales in the U.S. during the quarter fell 3% and same-store sales in the last week of March declined 60% to 70%. Meanwhile, sales tanked 50% in China during the quarter, according to the company.

Last week, Starbucks announce that it would be offering Beyond Meat (BYND) products in China. Shares of the coffee chain are down 11% this year.

Finally, chipmaker AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings of 18 cents per share on $1.79 billion in revenue during its first quarter. While COVID-19 likely hit AMD’s PC and gaming chip businesses, data center CPU & GPU sales to cloud customers probably benefited this year.

Story continues

“Tailwinds [for AMD] include strong cloud demand, low exposure to enterprise, and resurgent gaming,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note April 27. “Risks include 2H PC/console pull-ins/delays. However, AMD's smaller footprint in PC's (15% share) and competitive new products mitigates PC risk, in our view. On consoles, while a delayed launch is possible, demand should be fine, given major spec upgrades, and a re-invigorated/re-engaged gaming demographic.”

Other major earnings reports scheduled for Tuesday include PepsiCo (PEP), Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM), Pfizer (PFE), DR Horton (DHI), Harley-Davidson (HOG), UPS (UPS), Southwest Airlines (LUV) before market open; Mondelez (MDLZ), Ford (F) after market close.

627,2020-04-27T19:28:37+00:00,Apple delays mass production of 2020 flagship iPhones: WSJ,"Apple is reportedly delaying the production of its flagship iPhones this year, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to put pressure on the company, and its supply chain. Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley joins Seana Smith to discuss.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Let's talk about Apple. The company is reportedly delaying mass production of its 2020 flagship iPhones. Now the Wall Street Journal's saying that it'll be pushed back by just around a monthly. We have Dan Howley here with us to discuss this story.

And Dan, you and I have talked about in the past, we've heard rumors and the fact that Apple could potentially delay some of its new iPhones. Wall Street Journal now saying that this will, in fact, happen just in terms of production being pushed off. How significant do you think this is? Because I think a lot of the investor excitement for this year's 5G release was really what helped send Apple shares to record highs earlier this year.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, this is already basically built into the stock price, the 5G iPhone. And I think the expectation that it may not launch on time as well has been priced, and I think the issue for Apple would be how long of a delay it could be. Now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that it would be about a month off of the normal schedule for when it would be released as a result of mass production, issues related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic.

We were previously discussing with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives about Apple potentially putting off the unveiling of the device itself. Usually, what happens is you see a new iPhone come out around the September 12th, second week of September time frame. And then the device itself comes out two weeks later, and then you have that continued push of buyers up until the holidays, where you get the real huge uplift. And then that continues into the first half of the year and then slowly trickles off as a newer iPhone comes out that next September.

But if they end up pushing it off, I think really what you're going to see is just built up anticipation for this device. And then when they do have it released fully, can Apple keep up with that anticipation? Because this will be the first 5G device reportedly that Apple is expected to release, and that will be a hot seller, especially with all the hype around 5G.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-delays-mass-production-2020-192837024.html?.tsrc=rss,"['$E@EMCF.US', '0E7A.DU', '0J2X.XETRA', '0P00000PQH.F', '0P0000WN2O.LSE', '1096.HK', '58F178.KO', '6824.TSE', '91USC.NX', '9A90B.NX', '9E91B.NX', 'A50HZ.NX', 'AAPL.BA', 'AAPL.MI', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.SN', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL.VI', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AAPLC.BA']","['APPLE', 'DAN HOWLEY', 'MASS PRODUCTION', 'WALL STREET JOURNAL']","{'polarity': 0.895, 'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.056}"
628,2020-04-27T17:28:42+00:00,Why nobody on Wall Street really cares that Apple is reportedly delaying new iPhone releases,"If you’re Apple (AAPL), it pays to have gobs of cash and a gazillion plugged in sell-side analysts obsessively covering your stock. That’s especially so right now amidst a global health pandemic that has crushed the global economy and has made buying a new $1,000-plus iPhone sometime this year seem silly (if not financially impossible for many).

Shares of the tech behemoth barely budged on Monday following a story in the Wall Street Journal that Apple would push back the production of its latest iPhones by roughly a month. Apple typically releases several new handsets in the fall just before the holiday shopping season.

The company is reportedly working on four new iPhones for release this year, some with 5G capability.

Two Apple spokesmen didn’t return Yahoo Finance’s request for comment on the WSJ report.

At first blush, one would think news of a delay of any kind for fresh iPhones would be negative to Apple’s stock price. Not necessarily for a few reasons, strategists say.

First, a delay in the production ramp has been discussed at length on Wall Street and factored into a good chunk of profit estimates on Apple and the stock. Apple shares are down about 4% year-to-date, lagging the gains in other Big Cap tech stocks such as Microsoft (+10%), Amazon (+30%) and Netflix (+30%).

“This is right in line with our and many Street expectations with 5G slated to hit in late November/early December pre holidays,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

More important is that Apple is still — apparently — planning to have its new iPhones in the market before the critical holiday shopping season. By then, many would agree the U.S. economy will be in far better shape than it is today and interest in buying a new iPhone higher.

“This is something that was expected. The going thought is we push it forward or back a little bit [iPhone production]. That still gives people enough time to purchase devices for the important holiday season,” explained Futurum Research founder Daniel Newman on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

In the meantime, while major production delays would cripple the finances of most manufacturers, Apple is not a normal manufacturer. It’s a tech beast selling hardware that generates real-time money through various services and downloads. In turn, sell-side analysts estimate Apple will produce nearly $60 billion in free cash flow this year. That will easily allow Apple to fund a solid dividend and steady stream of profit-cushioning stock buybacks.

Apple ended its fiscal year (year ended Dec. 28) with more than $107 billion in cash and short-term investments.

“With a company with that much cash on their balance sheet, they are in a strong position to weather volatility,” notes Apple bull and chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments Victoria Fernandez.

And weather production delays, too.

Yahoo Finance’s Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the details. Howley also discusses Apple's potential plans to delay production on its newest iPhone.

Video Transcript

BRIAN SOZZI: Switching gears, Amazon is taking new steps to verify third party sellers. The e-commerce giant is testing the use of video calls to validate the seller's identity. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins us now to break it down. Dan, why wasn't Amazon doing this before?

DAN HOWLEY: I think they really just wanted kind of face-to-face interactions rather than a video interaction, but now that COVID has, obviously, everyone homebound, or at least preventing people from being able to meet in person, they're doing this video style. They had been piloting this before. They were using it in months prior, so this is something that they're continuing to use, and it's basically a way for them to vet sellers that are using the platform-- third-party sellers-- to ensure that what they're actually offering are legitimate products.

Now we've seen, obviously, investigations by various outlets showing-- I think particularly ""The Wall Street Journal""-- showed that they were offering some unsafe items, particularly children's toys with lead-based paint. There's obviously been an issue as well with the likes of Apple and Nike taking issue with the fact that there are fraudulent products sold through Amazon bearing their name. So now Nike doesn't even sell through Amazon as result. So this is a way for them to try to make sure that this is all kind of borne out, that they vet the people that are selling through their platform, and they can avoid any unfortunate issues with other companies disputing the fact that they may have fraudulent items or, more importantly, that items themselves are safe.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Hey, I want to switch gears for a minute here, Dan, and talk about Apple. I'm sure you saw this story in ""The Wall Street Journal"" this morning saying that the company is going to have to push back mass production of its flagship iPhone this year because of the pandemic. How much should investors be worried about that, given the fact that the iPhone makes up such a huge chunk of Apple's revenue?

Story continues

DAN HOWLEY: It's interesting, because, you know, we've seen reports saying that this was likely to happen for some time now. Most analysts I've spoken to-- particularly Dan Ives at Wedbush basically saying, look. It's more likely than not going to be delayed. We haven't heard anything, though, about the actual launch-- the launch event that they usually have in September. But if there's still lockdowns going on in September, that's not going to happen. And if there's still military hospitals set up in the country, that's probably not going to happen either. They would push it out a little longer.

I think for analysts and investors, this is something, as I said, was expected. The going thought now is, OK. So we push it forward a little bit or back a little bit. That's still gives people enough time to purchase these devices for the important holiday season. And as you go through the iPhone cell cycle, you'll have Q1-- you have the tail end of Q4, and Q2 where a lot of sales really happen. It's really just the end of Q4 there, though, when the new iPhones come out.

So the older phones start to phase out around Q3 and the bulk of Q4, and then we go back into the cycle. So it seems like they would still have the devices on store shelves for the tail-- the very tail end of Q4, Q1, Q2, and then into Q3.

HEIDI CHUNG: Hey, Dan, it's Heidi here. So a pretty busy week for you. We have a lot of those large cap tech names reporting. We just talked about Apple, but I want to get what The Wall Street analysts here are expecting when it comes to Microsoft, Amazon, a couple of those other names that you closely follow.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think for the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, Google, a lot of what we're going to be talking about is obviously cloud usage. We talked about how AWS had seen a surge. Azure from Microsoft likely saw a surge as well as Google's cloud platform. Any of these cloud companies are really taking a lot of traffic and as a result of so many people working from home and so many operations now having to be done remotely.

So I think we'll hear a lot about that. And don't forget, you know, these companies don't just provide services for businesses as far as B2B work. They also host platforms like Netflix, so they are going to see a ton of increased traffic, and that will probably bode very well for them. But then you have to think, OK, if the economy starts to slow down, Capex spending from companies will start to slow down, and that may translate into these companies saying, look. Down the line, we might not have the kinds of profits that we were expecting as a result of our cloud platforms simply because other companies aren't signing up for new contracts because they just don't have the bandwidth for it right now.

But I think for the coming quarters, we're going to see gangbusters stuff from them. Microsoft, on the other hand, with their hardware side, probably not. And Google as well. I think it's going to be harder for product side at this point.

630,2020-04-27T10:47:43+00:00,Coronavirus unleashes insane bubble in these 5 stocks and it could end badly for the bulls,"This market rally may be as fake as some of the bootleg hand sanitizers being hawked on Amazon and eBay at crazy prices to the worried quarantined masses.

Despite 26.45 million Americans having filed for unemployment claims the past five weeks and first quarter earnings season so far being as painful as being forced to watch “Tiger King” for the third time, the S&P 500 has rallied about 27% from the March 23 lows. The S&P 500’s forward price to earnings multiple of 21 times or so is at its highest level since right before the tech bubble back in December 2001.

Insane.

One would think we are amidst a solid economic expansion in the U.S. and accelerating EPS growth among businesses, not something as debilitating as the coronavirus pandemic.

“All the data is horrific. But it’s getting less bad than it was say a couple weeks ago and that’s especially true with jobless claims. So markets are focused on that marginal rate of change and and they think that the worst will be behind us when we move to May and June,” said Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Point well taken.

But the question right now the bulls should be asking themselves is how strong is the rally from the March lows, really? Are the bulls truly buying into the view the U.S. economy is back to its job creating, growth self this summer? Or, is the rally a mirage being fueled by heavy-hitting speculators (we see you, hedge funds) going back to tried and true winning trades in big cap tech? And in turn, this is creating the momentum that lures in the suckers just before the bottom drops out of the entire market again.

The data supports the latter observation.

The five big cap tech stocks

Coming into 2020, the five largest S&P 500 stocks comprised 18% of its market cap, matching the share at the peak of the tech bubble in March 2000, Goldman Sachs strategists note. Since then, those stocks — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook — have risen to account for 20% of the S&P 500’s market cap.

Story continues The statue of the charging bull is pictured on April 20, 2020 in New York City. - Wall Street opened lower on Monday as traders grappled with a drop in oil prices to 22-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand for energy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 percent to 23,798.01 about 10 minutes into the trading session.The broad-based S&P 500 had declined 1.3 percent to 2,835.08, while the tech-rich Nasdaq had fallen 0.7 percent to 8,588.66. (Photo by Johannes EISELE / AFP) (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)

Looked at another way, all five of those big cap tech stocks have handily outperformed the S&P 500’s 14% drop, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data — led by a 30% pop in Amazon. In effect, investors have pretty much forgotten about the other 495 stocks in the benchmark index because they have less belief in their ability to navigate the coronavirus situation for whatever reason.

A healthy market rally, however, would be under-pinned by a belief that more than five companies will successfully come out the other side. Where are the bets in industrial names? How about taking a stab at battered oil stocks — if the economy is going to burst back into gear later this year, surely we will need greater oil than the present right?

“Many market participants – ourselves included – have expressed incredulity at the fact that the S&P 500 trades just 17% below its all-time high amid the largest economic shock in nearly a century. Below the surface of the market, however, the median S&P 500 constituent trades 28% below its record high. This 11 percentage point gap is one measure of market breadth, which now stands roughly a standard deviation below its historical average,” the Goldman Sachs equities strategy team writes.

Such narrow breadth in the market comes with a warning from Goldman, as it should.

Says Goldman, “In addition to the Tech Bubble, breadth narrowed ahead of the recessions in 1990 and 2008 and the economic slowdowns of 2011 and 2016. Historically, sharply narrowing breadth has signaled below-average 1-, 3-, and 6- month S&P 500 returns as well as larger-than-average prospective drawdowns.”

And who is to say Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are worthy of their even more premium current valuations? None of these companies have reported first quarter earnings yet.

You mean to tell me 26.45 million jobless Americans doesn’t equate to reduced spending on cloud computing upgrades this year (it does)? A severe economic downturn in the U.S. like we are experiencing doesn’t mean sharply lower consumer spending (it has already, per retail sales data) and downside financial risk for Amazon? Small businesses going under will pressure advertising on Facebook.

The market will do what it wants to do in the end. What’s right though is a pause in the upward momentum in stocks, especially five enormous tech stocks.

In the stock market, there are two types of forecasters: the mean-reverse forecaster and the momentum forecaster. Your prediction often relies on what type of forecaster you are.

The market, however, is neither of these two types. The market has no memory when it charges forward or drops backward. In the short term, the stock market is more like a random walk, a Brownian movement that is pushed only by surprises. In the long term, the overall market goes up. For individual stocks, in the short term, there is more volatility than the general market. In the long term, some deliver monster returns, while some might drop to zero.

During a crisis, the division of the two types of forecasters is even more obvious. They might even laugh at each other. Both approaches are not very rational and could be dangerous. The mean-reverse forecaster might mistakenly feel at $3 stock price like AMC entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is very cheap because it was $10 just three months ago, ignoring the high bankruptcy risk. The momentum forecaster, on the other hand, could have sold most of the stocks when the S&P dropped to the 2,300 level in March, only to buy back at 2800 level now.

The stock market never has only one big drop from the peak. There was a deep one of about 34% in a single month. The reversal was also as volatile, rebounding 27% in less than a month. Is the stock market out of the woods now? in my opinion, it is unlikely.

A prolonged battle with Covid-19

The question of how long the virus will last depends on when the economy is reopened. It seems the U.S. will choose to reopen earlier due to pressure from the Presidend and businesses. This ""business friendly"" approach means we will likely see some breakouts in certain areas for a long time until a vaccine is available. There is light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel could be longer than we originally expected.

Story continues

If the battle drags into 2021, the market cannot continue its recent upward reversal, in my view. The ""business friendly"" approach is likely to backfire on businesses, from my viewpoint, due to larger numbers of people being infected.

Corporate earnings reports

The second half of April is earning season. When most companies report their declined financial performance for the first quarter of 2020, they might also paint an even greyer picture of the second quarter. The lower than expected guidance of earnings could drive prices lower.

The bankruptcy tsunami

An avalanche of companies filing for bankruptcy will also be bad for the markets. On April 19, the day I am writing this article, Reuters reported that Neiman Marcus is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection as soon as this week. JCPenny is reportedly considering a bankruptcy filing too, though these rumors are unconfirmed.

In one or two months, we could begin to see the largest bankruptcy wave in decades due to how heavily leveraged U.S. companies have become relative to history. Never before have we gone into a recession with such a high percentage of corporate leverage.

Second wave of layoffs

The 2nd wave of laying off will also hit the labor force soon. The first wave hit business at the frontline of this crisis. It began with the travelling industry, including airlines, cruise ships, hotels, car rental, etc. Then when the economy was shut down, it hit retailers, restaurants and all types of manufacturers. Eventually, banks who lend to business could fall under as well. For firms who remain operational, the employees have been spared so far, but with few exceptions, firms will eventually be affected because of lower demand, and employees will thus have to be let go.

The last pandemic-driven recession

The end of the Covid-19 health crisis could potentially signal a severe recession. The 1918 flu did not do as much damage to the stock market as the following Great Depression. I think it wasn't a coincidence that the Great Depression happened less than a decade after the 1918 flu pandemic.

The stock market will rebound eventually

Although the market might dive again if thing get worse than expected, it will eventually turn around far before the economy touches the bottom. The stock market is a leading indicator of the economy, but it does not always sync with the economy. When the market turns up, it won't be gradual. It might rebound fiercely and unexpectedly for many investors.

Given the uncertainty of a second market drop and eventual rebound, I believe investors should carefully balance their portfolios between a defensive strategy and an aggressive strategy.

Defensive strategy

My defensive strategy usually means investing in stocks that have a negative beta and low expected return. These firms are not cyclical and should do better than the market during economic downturns. During the current crisis, beta might not be a good measure. In theory, it measures the extent to which the individual stock and the market move together. In practice, beta is calculated by running the regression of past returns of individual stocks on the past returns of a market index. In other words, it is measured based on past relationship between the stock and the market. Such a relationship could be broken when we have a major shift in the market paradigm. Below are a few of the names can I consider defensive now.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Amazon is among the few corporations that might financially benefit from the crisis. However, most of its increased sales are likely from low margin groceries, and its supply chain could face the risk of partially shutting down. Once the crisis is over, many of its retail competitors may not even reopen, giving it more advantages to dominate. Amazon Web Services (AMS), the industry leader in the growing cloud computing market, would also benefit when isolated people and business need to be more connected. At $2,000 plus per share, it is a $ 1 trillion Gorilla, and I think there is still some upside.

ATT (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ)

Both telecommunications companies would not see significant decreasing demand of mobile connection services or streaming media. That said, ad revenue from media assets will be hit. By my estimates, these stocks are not expensive and pay good dividend yields. The dividend, however, might get suspended at these companies, especially AT&T with its high financial leverage and vast media assets.

Tencent (TCEHY)

China seems to have the virus under control for now, and the growth of Tencent won't be dented by the crisis, according to my analysis. It is not as cheap as it was several months ago, but it is still worth holding.

Aggressive Strategy

The worst performing stocks could turn out to be the best performing ones with the rebound of the market. In the second half of 2009, many stocks that had freefalls during the financial crisis delivered monster returns when the downward market reversed. There is one condition though: the company must have the liquidity to avoid bankruptcy when the storm hits. Here are some of my picks.

Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)

Earlier in January, Groupon reported a disappointing 2019 fourth quarter. The stock dropped 40% after the announcement, and that was before Covid-19. The company will discontinue its ""goods"" services and focus on local deals. I think the restructuring is the right move. Competing with mega players like Amazon in goods markets is a loser's game, in my view. Groupon's local deal business model makes sense and is sustainable. It is still the king in this market and sits on millions of cash. I think the company will survive, and its stock is worth investing in at a cheap valuation. Its total market cap is only around $500 million. It might become a good acquisition target for big internet and retail companies. I feel the potential reward outweighs the risk.

Carnival (NYSE:CCL)

Carnival now carries with it a stained reputation because of the ""petri dish"" Covid-19 outbreaks in a few of its ships. The company will stop sailing for several months, but it still needs to pay the hefty maintenance costs for ships and interest costs on its massive pile of debt. However, it successfully raised about $6 billion from financial markets recently, and I think the risk of immediate bankruptcy is low. External financing comes with interest as high as almost 12%, with convertibles potentially diluting the common shares further. However, the cruise business still has a huge unaddressed market, and the long term growth potential could return when the pandemic settles down.

632,2020-04-25T14:49:11+00:00,How coronavirus could accelerate the demise of cable TV,"Streaming is ballooning as the coronavirus pandemic locks most citizens indoors, and a new survey suggests it could also hastening the long-term trend of cable-cutting.

According to The Trade Desk, which surveyed nearly 3000 Americans recently, 64% of the respondents said they have either cut the cord, are planning to do so — or simply never subscribed to cable at all.

That number jumped to 75% for those aged 18-34 — suggesting that interest in cable is dwindling, especially amongst the younger generation.

“With only a quarter of young adults having any long-term interest in traditional cable TV, in a few years we won’t be talking about linear or cable TV at all. It will all be online and streaming,” The Trade Desk Chief Strategy Officer Brian Stempeck said in a statement.

A ‘billion dollar question’ The coronavirus could lead to an increase of cable-cutters as 64% of U.S. households reported a lack of longterm interest in cable TV plans (Source: The Trade Desk)

To further illustrate that point, 11% of those households that still do have cable said they plan to cut the cord by the end of this year — with 18 to 34-year-olds once again leading the charge. These trends are expected to continue, as Americans adhere to stay-at-home orders — and streamers are capitalizing on this unprecedented moment.

Netflix (NFLX) reported a record number of subscribers in the first quarter of 2020, nabbing nearly 16 million new accounts. That momentum is expected to continue even after the pandemic subsides.

“We anticipate the step-up will result in a permanent increase in penetration for Netflix's subscriber model and see its low price-point and staple nature supporting healthy fundamentals performance in a recession, even after stay-home orders are lifted,” Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler said recently. Netflix adds 15.7 million global users in Q1 2020 amid coronavirus pandemic (Source: Netflix, NYT)

Furthermore, the absence of live sports is also causing subscribers to rethink their cable plans. The majority of Americans (60%) say watching live sports is the primary reason they’ve kept their subscriptions in the first place, according to the survey.

Still, a larger question remains of whether or not streaming services will be able to keep people entertained when life eventually returns to normal.

Story continues

“That is the billion dollar question right now,” Raymond James analyst Justin Patterson told Yahoo Finance this week.

The answer, Patterson said, likely lies in Netflix’s ability to continue to provide localized content to its various international markets — and the platform is willing to cough up big bucks to do just that.

The streamer announced on Wednesday that it will raise an additional $1 billion in debt to fund original programming and acquire new content, positioning itself as a major threat to U.S. studios whose futures now hang in the balance.

633,2020-04-25T11:58:44+00:00,No more new TV shows or movies. Here's how to survive,"Only a few months ago we were complaining there were too many TV shows to watch, and that it was impossible to keep up.

Now is the time to catch up.

The coronavirus has stopped the production of movies and TV shows cold. In a matter of weeks we’ve gone lickety-split from peak content to trough content, i.e., no new shows.

What does this shutdown mean for Disney, Netflix, YouTube, and HBO et al., and never mind the media-entertainment-complex, what about all of us couch-potatoing our lives away during the pandemic?

I put those questions to legendary media investor Mario Gabelli, and he suggested all this was going to engender some serious seismic change.

“You have a lot of stuff that was put in the pipeline,” Gabelli said with his usual rapid-fire sagacity. “But who has the library and content and how do they keep it fresh? And you will get some strange things, and there will be those that structurally change. Will movie studios look to go direct to the consumer and bypass the theaters? Those are the questions we ask.”

This wither-the-entertainment-world question is no small potatoes, sideshow matter. Hollywood (writ large) is one of America’s last great businesses. (Software being another.) The United States doesn’t make the most steel or the most ships or the most cars anymore, but we do make the most content. And not only do we make the most, we make the best. Our story-telling, narratives, visual motifs and production values are emulated around the world. And we’re not going to relinquish that leadership position anytime soon. (Yes, I know Hollywood makes a ton of trash. And yes I love foreign films too.)

It’s also the case that entertainment has become vastly more important in our lives. BC (Before Covid), you’d ask someone what they were watching when the conversation flagged. AC, it’s pretty much the third thing you want to know. As in: “Are you and your family OK? How’s work? What are you watching?”

Watching content has become completely core.

Story continues

And so thanks to fortuitous timing, shows like “Tiger King,” the Michael Jordan docuseries “The Last Dance,” and Season 3 of “Ozark” are literally off the charts. Here are the numbers: Some 6.1 million watched the MJ doc, according to ESPN, a record for the network. Netflix’s “Ozark” tripled its viewership so far over Season 2 and according to Indiewire, is “projected…[to] have a viewership of 29 million within its first four weeks.” As for “Tiger King,” Netflix is saying 64 million households chose to watch Joe Exotic et al. (That’s a global number, but just for a point of reference there are 128 million households in the U.S.)

That’s an insane amount of eyeballs. A man looks at a mural depicting Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as ""Joe Exotic,"" in Dallas, Friday, April 10, 2020. The Netflix series ""Tiger King,"" has become popular watching during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maldonado-Passage was convicted in an unsuccessful murder-for-hire plot. (AP Photo/LM Otero)

And guess which company’s benefiting?

“The best positioned is Netflix,” says Deana Myers, research director at media & communications for S&P Global Intelligence. “They spend a lot on fresh content and have a vast library of acquisitions or older content. The company has so much in production and can hold out for the longest period. For another six months they could have significant fresh content.”

In case you missed it, Netflix reported beyond-boffo growth this week, adding 15.8 million new subscribers in the first quarter, more than double the expectation. The question now is how do CEO Reed Hastings and chief content officer Ted Sarandos proceed?

You can’t just flip a switch to make a show. These babies typically take many months to make, (especially since Netflix typically releases its shows in one fell swoop.) Take “Ozark” for instance. There was a 13-month gap between Season 1 and Season 2, and a 19-month gap between 2 and 3. Season 4 hasn't even been greenlit (though it almost certainly will), so we’re talking a release date of late 2021 or 2022 even.

Neflix gave details in its just released letter to shareholders:  “...we’ve paused most of our productions across the world. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production.”

But the release continued, “In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases…we are working hard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with additional licensed films and series.” And: “Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content.”

If Netflix is in the catbird seat, relatively speaking, who’s not?

Myers has concerns about traditional TV. “Streaming services in general are in a better position than broadcast or cable networks, which rely on sports programming — that’s a tough position. [And they] don’t have vast [amounts of] new programming. There wasn’t a lot teed up right now.” BTW, Netflix never getting into sports looks pretty smart—or lucky—right now.

Adds Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at TV[R]EV, author of “Over The Top: How The Internet Is (Slowly But Surely) Changing The Television Industry”: “If the economy goes really bad we think cord cutting will pick up tremendously. People will say I don’t have $50 to $100 to spend on stuff I hardly watch, versus pay $40 and have four services.”

Now let’s turn to some streaming upstarts, where the jury is out.

-Take Quibi. The new mobile-only streaming app launched on April 6 is off to a respectable enough start with 2.7 million downloads. “Quibi is building nicely,” chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg told me. “Especially given how crazy the environment is that we’re all living with. Quibi will not have a content delivery issue. We are fully supplied into November.” Myers though wonders if that will be enough.

-NBC’s Peacock, which did a limited rollout on April 15, goes full bore on July 15, but without the Olympics which was to give it a boost. That might end up being a blessing though. “About a year from now, we may get a content drought,” says Wolk. “That could work to Peacock’s advantage if the Olympics go on, and people would be tuning into that.”

-What about Disney+? “They’re in a tougher position. They have a lot in production,” says Myers. “But they’re not going to be able to finish a lot and air it.” On the other hand, Myers says, Disney will benefit from its strong line-up of kids’ programming, as Myers notes, “children will watch the same video 800 times.”

-Apple TV+? “The service that might get hurt I think is Apple, in terms of nobody will subscribe,” says Wolk. “They don’t have a deep library.” Wolk worries value-conscious consumers will balk.

‘Creative people are, well, going to be creative’

As for TV and movie producers who actually create the content, work has become a risky business. “We backed up all of our footage on drives and did a massive move of equipment to the editors’ and assistants’ homes,” says Daphne Pinkerson, producer at Blowback Productions, which has made a number of award-winning documentaries for HBO. “We had two films in The Tribeca Film Festival so it was pretty crushing when it was canceled. One was our Quibi series, “I Promise,” on the new school started by LeBron James and the other was an HBO film on Stockton, Calif.’s millennial mayor, Michael Tubbs.

“If we are not able to start new films soon because of social distancing, we are not going to survive,” she says. “Either that, or all our characters will have masks on. Maybe we can create transparent masks so we can see their lips move!”

Actually there are a few forms of media-making that continue unabated. If you’re a kid—or a fan of that, to my mind, awkward category of grown-up animation (“The Simpsons,” “South Park,” “Family Guy,” etc.) —good news, your game is still on. That’s not lost on Netflix which noted in its shareholder letter that “within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of our animation production team was back up and running, working from home.” Wolk thinks you may see even more animation coming out of Netflix. Disney too. The Simpsons: (l-r) Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Marge and Homer with dog, ""Santa's Little Helper"", photo

Another category going full tilt is audio books. “Because we’re a virtual, digital platform we're in good shape,” Audible founder and executive chairman Don Katz told Yahoo Finance. “TV shows are being canceled, and movies and Broadway are closed down. We have a network of individual studios and actors and a lot of famous people who know how to do this at home. We're trying to put a lot of people to work.”

Even with most of the entertainment business closed, creative people are, well, going to be creative. “People will start rolling out things that can be produced,” says Wolk. “Hollywood is putting minds together, maybe people will double or triple down on animated series and documentaries, things that don’t require a cast. We may even see, I don't know how feasible it is, innovations with computer generated actors.” And who knows, something like John Krasinski’s at home show, “Some Good News” which gets some 10 million views, might have staying power.

Remember too, what Gabelli alluded to. You are likely going to see mergers and deals. Some big ones probably. (Think at the Apple, Disney, Netflix level.)

But here’s the rub for all of you at home (ha.) Given the crazy number of TV shows and movies made over the past decade, there is no way anyone is going to run out of things to watch. Good things too.

Netflix alone released more than one new show or movie a day (270) in 2019, according to an analysis by Variety, more than the entire industry created in 2005. Bet you haven’t seen 10% of it. (BTW, ‘South Park” parodied all that content creation in an amusing send up: “Netflix. You’re greenlit. Whom am I speaking with?” SNL did a similar bit.)

Look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to catch up, an opportunity we hope to never see again. So go ahead and run through all those best streaming show lists. (I’ve seen only five on this one.) There’re a million shows out there. Seen “Giri/Haji?” Or “Stisel?” Or “Babylon Berlin?” Good stuff there.

Sometime in 2021 you may have had your fill and by then, with any luck, we will be back to some kind of normal. And soon enough, new shows will be on the way!

Video Transcript

ZACK GUZMAN: Meantime, I'm not sure if you caught the NFL draft last night, day one of the NFL draft, but things were a little bit different. It looked a lot more like our show here as we're all staying at home trying to flatten the curve. When you look at it, though, it might be impacting the way that Americans are rethinking their cable subscription, as live sports continues to be postponed.

For more on that, I want to get to Alexandra Canal for the latest in our Fame or Fortune segment. And Ale, I mean, a recent survey indicated that things are not looking good for a lot of Americans thinking about sticking with cable.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. So it's no denying that streaming has ballooned amid the coronavirus, and according to a new survey by the Trade Desk, it could be impacting how some people are considering their cable subscriptions moving forward. So according to the survey, 64% of US households have either cut the cord, are planning to cut the cord, or haven't even subscribed to cable.

And if you break that down by age groups, those age 18 to 34, that number jumps to 74%. So if you think about it, only about a quarter of young US adults have any long-term interest in cable. So if you picture that media landscape 5, 10, 15 years from now, it's very possible that cable could become obsolete and the focus could remain on just online and streaming.

To further illustrate that point, of those that have cable, 11% said they plan to cut the cord by the end of this year, that number once again jumping for those age 18 to 34 to 18%. But these trends are only going to continue to accelerate as people remain stuck at home due to the coronavirus, and as you mentioned, live sports remain off the air because that's really important to cable subscribers.

Story continues

For example, 60% of those that were interviewed in this survey said that's the main reason that they even have a cable subscription. So as live sports remain off the air, it's going to convince more people to try out different services like Netflix, like Hulu, like Disney Plus. So it's clear that this pandemic is tilting in the favor of those streaming services.

Just take a look at Netflix's impressive earnings report. They nabbed 16 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2020. And considering a lot of businesses are struggling right now, they're able to capitalize on this moment, and they're doing just fine. And then cable just seems to be a little bit behind the eight ball here.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, I mean, you raise a good point. When we look at those, those record subscriber ads from Netflix's latest quarter, it's still trading near all-time highs.

But when you think about it, they got to feed the beast. We did hear that they had most of their content in the can, but when it comes to Netflix maintaining that growth, it's going to require a lot of new content to come down the chute if people are chewing through all this content so quickly. So what are they doing on that front to make sure they can keep pace with their already record breaking pace here?

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, they're still feeding the beast. If you remember back in 2018, Netflix and Ryan Murphy signed a massive reported $300 million deal over the next five years. And coming May 1st, Ryan Murphy will be releasing his second project for the platform. It's called ""Hollywood."" And it tells the reimagined story of a much more inclusive 1940s industry.

So they released the trailer earlier this week. It created a lot of buzz on Twitter. I have a little snippet from that that I want to play for you guys. So take a look.

- If you changed the way that movies are made--

- Coffee, Miss Lara?

- --I think you can change the world.

- I want you to be the star.

- Really?

- If you want something, you have to declare it.

- I'll do anything.

- I am not just a star. I am a star maker.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, so you see there's a lot of familiar faces in that trailer, including Darren Criss, who has appeared in multiple Ryan Murphy productions in the past, such as ""Glee"" and ""The Assassination of Gianni Versace."" But what this show illustrates is Netflix's arsenal of content, talent, and resources. They said on Wednesday that they plan to raise an additional $1 billion to fund new programming, as well as acquire new content.

So they're really willing to put their money where their mouth is here. And that's going to help them win this streaming fight. We still have yet to see the emergence of some competitors. We'll see HBO Max make their grand debut in the streaming wars next month. But for now, Netflix is still the leader in this space. And they're still creating a lot of content that people are craving right now.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and at least the surge in subscribers making the cash burn a little bit better than we've come to expect, averaging about three billion a year, now down to just one with the surge in new subscribers.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: So for more on today's market, I want to bring in Keith Fitzgerald, chief investment strategist at Money Map Pricing. Keith, help me make sense of what's going on in the markets. What do you think investors are focusing on at this point?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, this is actually a good type of market action right now. It's a little bit muted for what I'd like to see at this stage of the recovery, but the narrative has shifted from doom and gloom to positive to what's going to happen when we come out of this. Psychologically, that's very important. Financially, that's very important. Because the support you're seeing key among sectors, you know, tech, medicine, some of those types of things.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, what do you-- what are investors, or how are they making sense of what we saw in the oil market, the turmoil recently in oil? How do you think investors are digesting that, and how is that affecting their outlook here, at least for the short term?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, I tell you, there's sort of two answers to that. The first is, is the world of high finance. It's not readily apparent to the average investor because what happened was largely a technical screw-up in the futures markets. As that affects our markets, oil, what that really says is there's simply too much of it going around. So if you went to the service station to take a drive, and service station would be paying you to fill your car up.

But again, even that's not so bad because when the recovery hits, there's plenty of gas available. That means consumers are going to benefit. As we go and we start running around and spending money, that's going to be a good narrative.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, it's interesting. When we focus on today's market move in the S&P, the range today was less than 1%. It's the lowest that we have seen since the all-time high that we hit back in February. What do you think-- are you reading into this at all, and do you expect us to be range bound here, maybe at least for the short term?

Story continues

KEITH FITZGERALD: Actually, no, I think the computers are building up energy to figure out what's going to happen next. Investors are trying to figure out whether we're going to revisit the lows or run to new highs. The answer to that is not yet seen, but what we do see, this is technically called compression. And when we get this type of phenomenon, we know the market is building up energy to move.

Now the president has made it very clear which way he wants to see things go. The Fed has made it very clear which way they want to see things go. Now it's all up to the traders and the sentiment. I think it's going to push higher, but we're going to have a little bit of turmoil coming into next week.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, what do you think investors are focusing on, just in terms of why there's still so much optimism in the market? Because I know you're saying that you expect markets to continue to push higher, but when you drill down into some of that economic data that we got out this week, it just simply does not look good.

We had that consumer sentiment number out this morning falling in April, that jobless claims number out yesterday, 4.4 million more people filing for unemployment. How are investors able to kind of wrap their heads around this and put it on the backburner and move on?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, funny enough, this is one of the few areas where individual investors have the advantage, watching professionals have to continually cycle money through the markets, which means they have to keep it moving. Individual investors can concentrate on CEOs, on the best companies with a clear path to profit, those that have huge piles of cash, and they can pick and choose very carefully.

So I actually, the folks I'm talking to around the world are very, very calm, believe it or not. Because they understand the CEOs have to play this game, regardless of what happens in the markets themselves. That, to me, is a source of profits and optimism.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, when you're taking a look at the market right now, what looks attractive to you? What are you buying?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, there's certain tech companies, for example, Micron and Nvidia that are critical. The coronavirus actually improves their bottom line a quarter or two from now. I'm very keen on other companies. You know, Apple, for example, earnings is coming out on Microsoft. Those are a lot of the companies I'm watching very, very closely because they have the potential to ride right through this and strong enough balance sheets to do it.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, you just mentioned earnings there. What are your thoughts on what we've seen so far? Because this week, we had just around a fifth of the companies in S&P 500 early reporting earnings. From what we've gotten this week, what do you think that tells us about what lies ahead for earnings season?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, I'm less concerned about the earnings themselves because it's kind of like betting on a horse race after you know the results. You know, Wall Street is going to have to do its homework. I think yanking guidance, as some of the companies have done.

But the big thing, to me, the critical takeaway is that we've seen a number of companies report solid numbers. So that says to me that not everything is broken, that we will get through this, and again, being an optimist at heart and in my capacity as chief investment strategist, I don't have the luxury of being right or wrong. What I have to do is look for the profitability, and again, that is a good takeaway for me.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, I was reading through your notes, and the one thing that stuck out to me was what you said about the retail sector and how you've remained very concerned by the tsunami of retail failures ahead. What do you mean by that, and what do you think the broader implications of this could be?

KEITH FITZGERALD: You know, this is really, if there's a negative here, it's millions of investors have been hurt. Millions of people are out of work. The retail sector, you've got Neiman Marcus, Gap. You've got other retailers who maybe are not going to be able to pay their rent, certainly not going to be able to pay their employees. I think we're going to have a huge number of stores that are going to go out of business, never to return again.

That has implications for shopping space, for malls, for office rentals. There's a lot of blowback that we haven't yet accounted for I think remain ahead. So that, to me, is the real negative here.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, real quick, on monetary and fiscal policies that have been put in place over the last couple of months trying to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, do you think they go far enough? And do you think that we'll need some more aggressive action from either the Fed or from Congress?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, I'll tell you what. I wish I was smart enough to figure that out. It strikes me as, you know, if we come out of this, if we really get a path to recovery, we start opening the country. And you know what? It's probably OK.

But if we have to extend the lockdown for any reason, if we have to stay in our homes, we have to shelter in place, and we get a secondary infection blown, then I don't think it is enough. I think we're going to have to have more extreme action, as unthinkable as that is.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Keith Fitzgerald of Money Map Press, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: We are joined now by Mario Gabelli. He is the Chairman and CEO of GAMCO Investors. Mario, great to talk to you. Thanks for joining today. Let's just start right now with how you are thinking about this environment, how you are trying to sift through all the mess we've seen in the market and the uncertainty of the economy to find attractive or interesting areas.

MARIO GABELLI: Yeah that's a great question, great way to start. You know, back in February I was out in Las Vegas on the middle of, last week of February. And at that time, everybody was worried about the supply-- but we-- shortages and supply chain disruptions that we had. Obviously, what happened in South Korea and Italy. And then we became very aware that it was the consumer that was going to get hit.

And we have a health challenge, and the markets, in the last week of March, had all the stress testing you wanted, all the algos, ETFs. And you just had somebody on on the oil patch, and obviously negative oil was just an example of what happens when you have leveraged ETF's that people had to unwind. And lots of interesting disruptions from mechanical trading.

But the Fed went into what I call hypersonic. Like a mach five, as opposed to a mach one, in terms of putting money in the system. Fiscal policy is catching up. We've got an infrastructure bill likely somewhere in the next horizon. And so you have a lot of pluses. Right now, you're going through the earnings season. I listened to several this morning.

And obviously, lots of earnings releases in the market for some stocks, like Belmont, went up and some had some challenges. Independent of that, we get past the second quarter and then we start thinking about, is there going to be a second wave of COVID-19. But independent of that, what happens in the first half of 2021?

Story continues

So we have always done what we did in the '60s, when I covered conglomerates as an institutional research analyst. What are the leading indicators? What are the coincidental? What are lagging? Which stocks will do well?

At the same time, we have to be realistic. 100 years ago, we had an Industrial Revolution in this country, and today we're seeing the dynamics of a digital revolution. What is going to change? When I order online, am I going to stay with a brand? What's happening to brand identification? How do-- if the consumer spends 2% shift from eating out to eating at home, is this permanent? They stocking their shelves or the pantry, or are they going to start?

And so what companies benefit from that. So those are the dots that we're looking at. And from my point of view, also following cyclical companies, how bad is bad? I've gone through like five auto cycles. Maybe six. How long will it last? And then how good is good and who is going to be the beneficiary of bringing a artificial intelligence, bringing the EB, being better, and shifting everything? Who's going to be the [INAUDIBLE], the entity that goes into the Amazon distribution centers and automates it, and how are they going to put in battery-powered vehicles?

And then we obviously have what I call the bottle stocks. BOTL have had a challenger. The banks, with the stress testing. The oil patch you talked about earlier, no need to echo on that. That's a great beneficiary for consumers in China. Great beneficiary of the US, but bankruptcies will happen to the producers. And we'll work our way through. Then travel and leisure.

Do I want to go back to Las Vegas? When will they open? How will they space the dynamics there? What happens to convention center hotels? What happens to the whole infrastructure? Will I get into an Uber without, you know, worrying about who was there before? Will I do Airbnb?

So you do have lots of the dots.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

MARIO GABELLI: And that's what we look at every day.

ANDY SERWER: Hey, Mario. Andy Serwer here. Sorry to jump in. I just want to ask you about streaming, entertainment, TV, Hollywood, because you are the media maestro investor of all time. And here's the thing. You know, we were talking about peak content just a couple of months ago. And now, are we going to be looking at trough content going into 2020-21 because there's no production going on. Are we going to run out of content?

MARIO GABELLI: Well you have a lot of stuff that was put in the pipeline, like classic films that would have been enormous box office successes. You know, Tom Cruise had one. Some of the Disney movies, they've all been pushed forward. I just talked to a movie theater operator today, and you know, how are they going to position themselves? They have an ability to space everyone six seats apart. And how much of that is going to come back?

In China, which is 40-- the US box office, Andy, was $42 billion last year. $10 billion in China. They just shut the theaters down. Now that's going to come back, slowly. I mean, we have an office in Shanghai, we have an office in Hong Kong, and they give us an update of traffic patterns and what people are doing.

So there will be a gap in creative content. Netflix mentioned that. Anybody reading the Hollywood Reporter, Variety knows that, and that's a reality of the dynamics that we're facing. Independent of that, who's got the library, and who's got some content, and how do they keep it fresh? Will Sony, which has a great music, what are they going to do with their film entertainment business?

Will they now look to, find Tencent to do something with? Will they do something with Alibaba? Will they do something with the companies in China? Or will they do something with the companies up in Seattle? Will Amazon say, hey, listen, let's do a deal where we put it together with Paramount?

You saw that in streaming, in the music world today. John Malone and Greg Maffei put together a transaction, which is classic you know, quilting together their Formula One entity and shifting Live Nation over to Liberty Sirius. Liberty Sirius is also-- has great care-- own Liberty-- they own Sirius. They're trying to figure out what they do with Pandora.

So streaming music is up sharply. That helps companies like Vivendi, where they sold 10% of it to Tencent for a very interesting market cap. Will Sony do something like that?

Independent of that, clearly there will be those that structurally change. Will direct to the consumer of a theater bypass the window and not go to the theaters? Or will they have to open box office? Those are the questions we will ask. On the advertising front for television, if you're a TV station, the local, 70% or 80% of your revenues were derived from local.

No car sales? At 40% to 50% or 60% down, what we thought with Bloomberg and Steyer would carry through the year, I still think you'll have significant political in the second half of the year. And that's a plus. I think car sales have come, not roaring back, but come back. And they've start advertising again.

So the local advertisers, unfortunately, they are cash to-- the debt-to-EBITDA has gone for 4 times to 8 times, since that's high leverage, but they've got huge cash flow coming up in the next six months. So we're trying to figure out which ones we want to own, which ones we'll consolidate, which will be part of a consolidation process.

And the same thing with regards to Spectrum. The FCC is going to have a new Spectrum auction with the T-Mobile Sprint deal being done. What does that mean? So those are the kind of dots in the environment of the film entertainment. Then you get some strange things. You've got the WWE, World Wide Wrestling was considered essential in Florida, so they're opening up. Tonight you've got the football draft. That's going to be quite entertaining.

Then you've got Tiger Woods doing a foursome of golf carts apart. And so we've got to bring it back. So one of the stocks I like is baseball. I still like the Atlanta Braves. The stock is selling at $17.18. And with a 60 million shares, you're talking about a billion market cap, a real estate's worth of debt. And can I buy a baseball team? Yeah I want you to buy it for your granddaughter. I want you to buy it for a grandson. You can buy a Madison Square Garden, which went through financial engineering today.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. Well, Mario, let's talk a little bit about, let's talk a little bit about MSU. Last time you and I spoke, a year ago, I think, I outlined some MSG case. You told me I had it all backwards. We were waiting for Zion Williamson to arrive in town. When you look at a company like that, and some of these live assets, you know, where you're looking at a building, how can companies try to outline what the next 18 months might look like? I mean, when are the fans going to be in the building, when are you gonna be able to have a concert? These sorts of things.

MARIO GABELLI: Well, a concert is something different. I think that there is a great deal of interest in tribal relationships, sports in particular. You know, the concert streaming does help those that don't copyright and own content. Even with the modern music act, the helping out the way the fees are calculated and collected. But basically, you go back to question, will the baseball season start? Will they have an opening day in one location? Will everybody play? Will basketball play in Phoenix, as they're talking about and have all the teams there, all the players, and have a finish? Work in progress.

Goes back to one giant step, Andy. Testing. OK? How do we ramp up testing? How do we increase the capacity for a second wave? How do we prepare? Every drug company we talk about, in terms of testing, has gone up 20%, 30%, 40%. One [INAUDIBLE] has gone from like, 60 to 120-- 125.

The digital world is-- Teledoc-- has gone from 75 to 170. So you have a lot of these dynamics occurring, and you know, what price do I want to pay and what valuations do I want to get. And even this morning, you had the BlackRock talk about financial engineering, and how they're seeing significant opportunities. And then you'll have structural changes. JC Penney's gone bust. Lord and Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and what happens to shopping centers? What happens to commercial buildings?

MELODY HAHM: Yeah, Melody Hahm here. When you think about the leadership that you're hearing from as you tune into these earnings calls, with so much murky guidance ahead, we've seen a lot of crisis-management leadership, right? Whether it's the Bob Iger's of the world choosing to come back. We saw that New York Times piece on Bezos really stepping back up to that CEO role, and living into that title. What leaders are you really looking towards, and effective leadership strategies?

MARIO GABELLI: Well that's totally different. I was down in Florida visiting with Nextera Energy. They're clearly one of the leaders through an entity that I like called, the National Energy Partners, NEP, which is their play on wind and solar. As an example, Madison Gas and Electric has a wind farm going up. Google's taking their wind because they are still sensitive to climate change.

And as a result of that, which companies have that kind of a skill set? Offshore wind, offshore solar, battery technology for storage, and obviously transmission. And how do we protect transmission from cyber security? Those are still the dots that we connect.

And so that's why I like Avangrid at $44, $45, it's $310 billion shares, of which $250 million are owned by Iberdrola, which is one of the leaders on the global basis. And then in terms of leadership, Valmont, as an example-- a couple of you wouldn't know much-- but they're in a variety of businesses. They gave you the dots.

So analysts can do and connect. They don't want earnings guidance. I want the dots. How much is CapEx, what's your effective tax rate, what's your cash tax rate, what's going on. And then we worry about next year when somebody has to pay the bills, and the Fed holds off from putting incremental money into what happens to T-bills, what happens to commercial paper, what happens to money markets, and financing.

MYLES UDLAND: All right. Mario Gabelli, always great to get your thoughts. Mario Gabelli, of course, the Chairman and CEO of GAMCO Investors. Thank you so much for taking the time today. Hopefully we can talk to you soon.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: Let's move now to a very interesting story we saw in ""The New York Times"" today, has echoes of news we've seen from other major corporations. That's the report that Jeff Bezos has taken a much more hands-on, day-to-day role at Amazon than he has in the last couple of years.

Melody Hahm, we know that Bezos has lots of money. We know that he's very interested in what's happening in space. And you know, ""The Times"" noted in their story, he's spent a day a week for a couple years on Blue Origin. But it's now a developing and interesting theme to see leaders that had been-- I wouldn't say figureheads, but had definitely viewed their careers in a different light getting their hands dirty in a way they probably haven't in five or 10 years, given the crisis we're in.

MELODY HAHM: And that's the thing, Myles, right? Where being able to delegate, being able to create new leaders and sort of a path forward is the hallmark of great leadership. So you could argue that the likes of Iger and Bezos, they had set that in place in order for them to have the luxury and privilege of dabbling in creative, fun ventures like Blue Origin, as you mentioned. And even Iger echoed that saying. He wants to be more creative. He doesn't want to deal with the minutia.

But I think this sort of a crisis highlights the fact that even Bezos' appearance at a warehouse, right? That was the first time I think he had a public appearance in several years, which just shows how far removed he was even from the Seattle operation then the Amazonian empire, to a certain degree. So I think this is almost wartime leadership, and this is when crisis management comes to play. And the people who led the companies to success up until this point, they kind of have to take the reins.

MYLES UDLAND: Well, and Dan, you know, I've been thinking, like the end of last year, there was the stories about, you know, Bezos hanging out with Lauren Sanchez and going on vacation. And I was-- I kind of thought it was a legitimate story to dig into, like, should we be worried about Jeff Bezos? Do Amazon shareholders need to worry about Jeff Bezos? But this crisis comes along, and all of a sudden, ease all the way back in. And I just-- I find it interesting the way that CEOs of companies can let their attention drift, even though things are good at the company. But you know, when the going gets tough, they kind of turn it back on.

Story continues

DAN ROBERTS: Well, I think you let your attention drift to your other passions when things are good enough that it allows you to do that. And then Melody's right that this is really like a wartime for these companies. Now, the difference between Disney and Amazon is that Bob Iger, it was actually announced, was no longer going to be the CEO. And still, as of now, he's officially not the CEO, even though the story, of course, a week ago that we discussed was him taking over the reins sort of unofficially.

Now, the difference here is you can say that Jeff Bezos was on to other pursuits, but he was still CEO, and he remains CEO. So not quite apples to apples, but speaking at a macro, vaguer sense, of course, it's very similar. I mean, neither story is surprising to me. Of course, at this dire time, the guy who is the face of the company takes charge again. And Iger is still, even now and even before the stories that he has come back to the leadership position, was and is the face of the company. I mean, sorry Bob Chapek, but it is Iger. Iger is the guy, just like Bezos is the guy at Amazon.

And even another example, Under Armour, you know, a very different industry but another company that is in the discussion is being racked by coronavirus and was already in trouble. You know, Patrick Frisk is now the CEO. But by all accounts, it's still Kevin Plank's company, just to name another example.

MYLES UDLAND: Well, and I guess, you know, going back to the Bezos conversation, like, who is-- who would even be next at Amazon? And I guess the question is, does the future of Amazon look like whatever the future of Disney was supposed to be? I mean, is the next CEO of Amazon some, you know, internally not anonymous but publicly anonymous figure who's running-- I mean, people know who Andy Jassy is. He runs the--

DAN ROBERTS: I was just about to say that Andy Jassy. I mean, it can be Jeff, too, Jeff Wilke.

MYLES UDLAND: Right, is there someone more minor like that who could step it?

DAN ROBERTS: Yeah, you'd think an Andy Jassy or Jeff WIlke. There are a couple of names that are known entities, to the market and to analysts and to shareholders, but I think externally, to the average customer or even a person who follows the stock market, they just know Jeff Bezos. So almost any name, even if it's AWS CEO Andy Jassy, would be a completely new name to the public.

MYLES UDLAND: Right, and then Melody, I guess the next-- I mean, these come in threes, so the next person we're going to have to get this same treatment for is going to be Elon Musk, right?

MELODY HAHM: Exactly. I actually had a brief conversation with John McNeill, who was the COO and was considered the Sheryl Sandberg for Elon Musk yesterday, and he was saying that it was obviously a stressful role, and he's kind of interested to see who Musk depends on during this time because, as we know, he is a very mercurial kind of executive in a way that I think he's even different from Bezos and Iger in that regard. So I think in Elon Musk's case, perhaps the general counsel, even though there's been a lot of changeover over the past few years and then maybe someone in the engineering side of things.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. I mean, the problem is, we all know at Tesla, every executive has left the company, almost--

MELODY HAHM: Exactly.

MYLES UDLAND: --and now has moved on.

DAN ROBERTS: Well, and not to mention, remember, Elon Musk is sleeping under his desk at the Tesla factory. He doesn't quite count as Iger and Bezos where you can see that he had previously stepped away and now is returning.

MYLES UDLAND: Right, yeah, I don't even know if there's a third person who fits that role, but surely there will be another CEO who gets a similar, again, media treatment on their return to manage the company through this crisis.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bezos-takes-reigns-amazon-amid-200145866.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0P00014M3G.F', '0P00017G8R.LSE', '25UEC.NX', '40WPC.NX', '52EG85.KO', '6235.TSE', '708298.TWO', '9A60B.NX', '9E91B.NX', 'AMZ.BE', 'AMZ.DU', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.HA', 'AMZ.HM', 'AMZ.MU', 'AMZ.STU', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.BA', 'AMZN.MI', 'AMZN.MX']","['AMAZON', 'JEFF BEZOS', 'MYLES UDLAND']","{'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.108}"
639,2020-04-23T17:27:59+00:00,Investors think the coronavirus has put the US economy into another Great Depression: strategist,"It’s always next to impossible to pinpoint precisely what the stock market has priced into valuations. Although right now, equities strategists would universally agree the market has factored in two quarters of outright economic ugliness in the United States at the hands of the deadly coronavirus.

The wild cards sitting here today is how the market will react to finally receiving the economic dread it has come to expect since the health pandemic erupted in early March. And then, has the market bounced too hard from the March lows on the expectation of V-shaped economic recovery later this year that may not appear, given the realities of a post pandemic world?

“I think the expectation of market participants is that we’re in the Great Depression and that in a sense, the news can’t get much worse,” said BNY Mellon chief strategist Alicia Levine on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

To Levine’s point, it’s interesting to see the market continue to rally in the face of brutal reads on the U.S. economy. It only fuels the thesis that the bottom in the markets formed on March 23, which may be a flawed view. The latest upbeat market response arrived on Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 300 points in the face of news that another 4.427 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits.

Since mid-March, 26 million more people have applied for jobless benefits. This would mean an unemployment rate of 20.6%, per math from MUFG chief economist Chis Rupkey, who points out the rate is closing in on Great Depression levels where a quarter of all jobs are lost.

“It is going to take years not months to put these pandemic jobless workers back to work at the shops and malls and factories and restaurants across the country. What are stock market investors thinking? There's at least 33 million people out of work in the country. Investors should be running for their lives,” Rupkey contends.

Rupkey notes the stock market fell 57.7% at the worst point of the Great Depression. The S&P 500 was only down 13.3% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close of trading.

‘I would be hedging myself’

Moreover, big cap tech stocks such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Netflix continue to trade as if this was the 2019 economy, not one where a quarter of jobs in America have vanished within two months. The Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 ratio has climbed back to 2000 dot com bubble highs, points out researchers at SunDial Capital.

At some point soon, the market could be forced into pulling off its rose-colored glasses. Sure, extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve is a major backstop to equities as history has proven again and again. But for investors to completely ignore jarring information on the economy seems absurd.

“I would be hedging myself in this marketplace. There is still a lot of uncertainty, there is an outstanding number of people that are not working right now,” says Advisorshares CEO Noah Hamman. “I’m optimistic that the economy is going to turn around. But it doesn’t mean that the stock market is going to follow along with it.”

Sounds like reasonable insight inside of a Great Depression.

640,2020-04-22T14:14:47+00:00,Seattle mayor considers reopening economy 'sector by sector',"Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she would consider a “sector by sector” approach to reopening the Puget Sound economy — if and when coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Durkan said she would weigh a business’s ability to operate remotely to determine which sectors should be allowed to return first.

“[During stay-at-home orders] we had employers who could work from home but we also had a lot of people who couldn’t. Our small businesses, our manufacturing sectors were hit a lot harder,” she said.

Businesses in the Puget Sound region —home to Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nordstrom (JWN) — have largely been limited to working from home since Washington issued its stay-at-home order on March 23rd. The restriction followed a spike in coronavirus cases in the state, where 37 of the first 50 deaths in the U.S. were reported.

But last week, Governor Jay Inslee said social distancing measures have been successful in “flattening the curve” in the the state. As of Wednesday morning, 5,379 COVID-19 cases and 372 deaths have been reported in King County.

The state’s current stay-at-home order expires on May 4, though the governor has indicated some restrictions will remain in place beyond that.

“We’re really going to have to be smart about how we open up. We know we have to do it, people want to come back together,” Durkan said. “We want an economy going, but it would be devastating to open up and then precipitously have to close again.”

A three-part plan to reopen the economy

A roadmap for reopening unveiled by Inslee Tuesday night prioritizes statewide testing and contact tracing and calls for phasing-in the reopening of certain businesses while continuing social distancing.

Inslee said the state needs to be processing between 20,000 and 30,000 tests a day for contact tracing to be effective. He’s urged the federal government to help secure additional resources.

“It will look more like a turn of the dial than a flip of the switch,” Inslee said in a public address. “We’re going to take steps and then monitor to see whether they work or if we must continue to adapt.”

Boeing resumes production

Both Inslee and Durkan stress that any reopening would be “guided by science.” But at least one major company in the region has resumed its operations.

Roughly 27,000 Boeing (BA) workers returned to commercial airplane production line this week. The company said it will stagger start times, spread-out work areas, and require face coverings, in a potential sign of what other workplaces could look like.

Durkan said Boeing was given the green light largely because it is considered an essential business for national defense.

“We open, we monitor, we watch. And if it’s not working, we take different steps,” Durkan said.

While sectors like manufacturing and construction may be among the first to see restrictions lifted, Durkan said tech companies may be among the last, in part because they are well equipped to work remotely. Alphabet’s Google (GOOG), Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook (FB) offices were among the first to begin working from home, weeks before the statewide stay-at-home order went into effect.

“We have to look at the epidemiology and the economics, and that’s how we have to make our decisions,” Durkan said.

Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten (52 x 11’), the action-adventure comedy series targeting kids ages 4 – 7, is co-produced by Alibaba Group, Stan Lee’s POW! Entertainment, and Schwarzenegger’s Oak Productions.  In addition to his likeness, Schwarzenegger lends his voice as the lead character in the series.

We know we have a hit on our hands and cannot wait to share it with kids everywhere.”

About Superhero Kindergarten 
Five years ago, a tremendous superhero battle blanketed the small town of Greenvale in cosmic radiation. Shortly thereafter, a previously ordinary diverse group of boys and girls, are showing the most unusual superpowers! Their superpowers, however, rather than coming from Kryptonite, or a radioactive spider, come from items in their kindergarten classroom….white glue, wooden blocks, crayons, silly putty, etc.

A very special kindergarten teacher arrives in Greenvale to train these super-kids. Arnold Armstrong (Arnold Schwarzenegger) knows what it is like to control superpowers, because he used to be Captain Courage, the hero whose final battle resulted in the previously unknown powers of the super-kids! Arnold will teach the kids how to become the heroes of tomorrow, once he teaches them how to tie their shoes! This is a series of action, comedy, and fun, based on the genius and imagination of the great creative icon, Stan Lee, and with the important lessons of health, exercise, nutrition, and anti-bullying.  Just as he appeared as a cameo in all of the Marvel movies, Stan himself will be an animated cameo in each episode, with a digitized recreation of his voice as well.

642,2020-04-16T15:06:52+00:00,Why grocery workers should be called first responders,"Stew Leonard Jr., CEO of Stew Leonard’s Grocery Stores, joins Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous and Brian Sozzi to discuss how Stew Leonard’s and other grocery chains are faring amid the coronavirus.

Video Transcript

- Residents across the country have been told to shelter in place, people working from home, home schooling, and only living when necessary. One of those necessary outings, though, is to the grocery store. And now the CEO of one grocery chain is calling for these employees to be designated as first responders.

Joining us now is that CEO, Stew Leonard Jr. Of Stew Leonard's. Stew, always good to speak with you here.

STEW LEONARD JR.: Hi.

- So why do you think grocery workers should be classified as first responders?

STEW LEONARD JR.: Well, I think it's tough for us right now. I'm out on the floor right now in the store every single day. I'm trying to set the leadership role up here as-- for our family. But it's very tough, because you have customers, you know, you're dealing with interactively at the deli counter, at the cash registers, you know, at the butcher shops, and the fish departments. And you're asking people to be face to face. And as we know with social distancing, that's the one thing you don't want to do, is be within six feet of somebody.

- Stew, I can see from behind you, you look pretty well stocked there. You got a worker with a mask on stocking up some oranges. But I mean, when I go out to the store-- and this is just my own local grocery store-- it's still really, really hard to get paper goods. There are just some items it's nearly impossible. What are you finding right now? Are you able to get all items to your stores in a timely fashion?

STEW LEONARD JR.: You know, that's one of my biggest jobs every day. And we have four F's that we're focusing on. The first one is full shelves. OK, we are doing everything we can. We're buying direct. You know, we don't go through middlemen or anything. So Stew Leonard's is lucky enough to get supplied.

Story continues

I just talked to one of our ranchers out in Montana last night on the phone. He said, I got plenty of cattle. You know, so he's assured me we're going to have plenty of beef. You know, chicken, fish, fruits and vegetables, as you can see. So full shelves is number one.

The second thing we're working on is flattening the curve. We have hundreds of thousands of customers shopping in our stores every week. And one of the things we can do through helping social distancing here, keeping everybody six feet away. We limit the number of people coming into the store to half of what we normally would. And we also are requesting each person come alone. So if you'll notice right now, you're not seeing a lot of family shopping, which they usually would do at Stew Leonard.

The third thing we're trying to work on is friendly people. It's really difficult to motivate the front line people today. You know, we're giving them appreciation pay of $2 an hour. We're giving sign-up bonuses of a couple hundred dollars to get other people to work here.

And I just heard you talking about unemployment a little bit. And I think the unemployment option is to attractive. We're actually having a hard time hiring people right now at Stew Leonard's. You'd think with the restaurant business-- all the restaurant workers available, we'd have a flood of people to help us in our kitchens. But that's not happening.

The fourth F that we have to try to feed the first responders and the needy. You know, if any listeners actually-- any communities around Stew Leonard's that any of your listeners feel really need food right now, we'd love to hear from you. You can go to our Facebook page and copy that. So those are the four F's that we're focusing on at Stew's right now.

- That's a great-- you're a great resource for all those folks who are definitely-- and it's a real need, the need for food right now, Stew. You mentioned you talked to a cattle rancher in Montana. You know, you've got Tyson Foods, Smithfield coming out and saying they've had to shut down some factories. Their own workers have gotten the virus. And there was a fear that perhaps we're going to have to start stocking up on meat, because there's not going to be a supply. Do you see that coming down the pike at all, that perhaps we're going to have an issue of getting meat?

STEW LEONARD JR.: You know, we-- we've tried to be out in front of everything that's happening-- Governor Cuomo, Governor Lamont, and Governor Murphy of New Jersey. We've tried to be listening and moving ahead. But the one thing I never anticipated with the COVID-19 is the-- in the supply chain, is the lack of production workers. Like Fred [? Whacker ?] who I talked to last night, a big cattle rancher, 35,000 head of cattle out there-- he said, I can get the beef. But now there's not enough people in the packing plants to cut it, you know, and to package it for me.

So that's where I'm seeing a little hiccup. And it's hard to predict. I think the meat companies probably have to give more incentives to their people to try to work. But the beef's there, you know. It's there. We have the shelves for it here. We just have to make sure everybody in the middle from not only the packers but the truckers end up getting it out here to the stores.

- Stew, bigger picture here. How do you think grocery shopping will change looking beyond the worst of the coronavirus pandemic? We've seen a lot of grocers put up sneeze guards at checkout. You see Walmart putting up one-way aisles. Is that look into the future?

STEW LEONARD JR.: Well, that-- I would love to talk to somebody about that. Because I wonder-- we used to have the big food buffets at the store. We had to close them down. We had a big bagel display where we made fresh bagels and put them out in bins. And you could go pick your own. I don't think that's going to come back for a while right now.

We did a lot of food sampling in the store. That has-- we've stopped all of that. So the complexion of a grocery store has changed. Fortunately, we've always had a one way aisle. It's wider than most stores. And it definitely does help traffic flow and spacing.

The question I wonder-- and we've been through 9/11 here. Right-- we're right near New York City. It is going to take a while for everybody's mood to get done. But I don't think it's going to change until we get a-- there's going to be a vaccination for this.

- And Stew, before I let you go, on a personal level, how has this situation been like? You're-- it's a family business. What has this been like for you to operate a-- operate the family business through this type of situation?

STEW LEONARD JR.: You know, it's something I didn't expect to be as difficult as it is. Just a-- you know, we've always been-- you know, been in the Fortune 100 best companies to work for. And we really love our people. We have a lot of long time people. And I find a tremendous responsibility to educate our people.

We do a deep cleaning here at Stew Leonard's every night. And hand sanitize-- I mean, hospital sanitation and so forth. So the cleanest place our team members can be is here every day. But when they go home, you know, it's the cell phone that they're touching. It might be the car door. There's a lot of other things you're touching.

So these gloves-- the only reason I wear them and every one of our team members has to wear a mask-- and now they're requesting customers to wear masks when they come in-- is so that you don't-- the only reason I wear gloves is so it reminds me not to touch my face. [LAUGHS] Yeah.

- All right, let's leave it there. Stew Leonard's-- Stew Leonard Jr. Stay safe out there. Appreciate you all-- everything you're doing for shoppers.

STEW LEONARD JR.: You know, I appreciate that. And I just want to assure everybody, I wake up every morning. I'm trying to get fresh food out on the shelves. And I want to keep the store looking like this for however long this goes on. So anyway, everybody be--

- [? Good luck, ?] Stew, now. We'll been in touch soon.

STEW LEONARD JR.: Be safe.

643,2020-04-09T14:06:33+00:00,The Top 3 Ways to Trade a Pullback in Volatility,"Novel coronavirus fear spiralled out of control. States have issued “stay at home” orders. Schools closed for the year. Events were cancelled. Flights were grounded. All thanks to a global pandemic that has now affected more than 400,000 people just in the U.S. Fear was so out of hand, the CBOE Volatility Index (CBOE:VIX) rocketed to a high of 83 before falling to a current level around 43.

And, at the time, some of the safest opportunities were those I first mentioned on Feb. 27, including the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (NYSE:UVXY), which ran from $20 to a high of $135. The Velocity Shares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NASDAQ:TVIX) ran from $86.50 to a high of $1,000. Even the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (AMEX:VXX) ran from $21 to a high of $78.84.

Though, at some point, volatility will begin to fall.

7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential

When that happens, you want to be well positioned to make money from that, too. Here are the top three ways to do just that.

ShortVIXShort-Term FuturesETF (NYSE:SVXY) VelocityShares Inverse VIX Mid-Term ETF (NASDAQ:ZIV) InvescoQQQ ETrust (NASDAQ:QQQ)

These three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are the ones to watch. But a word of warning — some of these funds intend to match the daily results of the index, and holding them long-term can introduce its own volatility.

Profit From Volatility: ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) The Top 3 Ways to Trade a Pullback in Volatility

Expense Ratio: 0.95%, or $95 per $10,000 invested annually

My first pick is the SVXY. This ETF was designed to offer one half the inverse of the S&P 500VIX Short-Term Futures Index, daily. Along with the VIX, it was designed to track the changes in expectations for one month in the future.

At the moment, the ETF trades around $32 after diving from a high of $67.50. With a good chunk of fear firmly priced into the market, the SVXY ETF could refill a bearish gap around $66, near-term. Of course, plenty of patience is required at the moment.

Story continues

We must also remember that crisis often leads to big opportunity. As even billionaire Warren Buffett will tell you, be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. Baron Rothschild also teaches us to “buy the blood in the streets.”

VelocityShares Inverse VIX Mid-Term ETN (ZIV)

Expense Ratio: 1.35%

My second volatility pick is the ZIV. This ETN was designed to offer inverse exposure to an index of VIX futures. It seeks -1x the returns of the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures for a single day. As volatility decreases, the ZIV ETN will typically push higher.

At the moment, the ETN trades around $32 after tumbling from a Feb. 2020 high of $76.47. With a good amount of patience, I strongly believe the ZIV ETN could refill its bearish gap around $75 a share.

7 Companies That Deserve to Be S&P 500 Stocks

As even Sir John Templeton would tell investors, “The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.”

Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ)

Another way to trade deflating volatility is by buying the QQQ, which I mentioned on March 25, 2020 as it traded at $185 a share. At the moment, it’s up to $202 and could refill a bearish gap around $230 a share with patience.

The beauty of the QQQ ETF is that it offers more for less. And most of its top holdings are wildly oversold on coronavirus fears. For less than $200 a share, you’re offered exposure to tech companies, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and dozens more at a steep discount.

With a good amount of fear priced in, I strongly believe the QQQ is overdue for a big rally.

* Thorntons suspends online orders

* Easter is one of busiest seasons for UK chocolate markets

By Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale

LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - Britons locked down because of the coronavirus pandemic risk missing out on their annual chocolate binge.

With big family gatherings off limits, friends and relatives are unable to meet and hand over Easter egg treats, and chocolate makers' online sites are struggling to keep up with exceptionally high demand for deliveries by this weekend.

Easter eggs are on sale in shops but those customers who do venture out have been focused more on stocking up on basics such as pasta and tinned food.

Creme egg maker Cadbury, owned by U.S. group Mondelez , said demand for its eggs in stores was lower than usual this year but traffic on its website had surged five-fold.

The company has tied up with a Danish startup whose software creates virtual queues to prevent retail websites from crashing. Those queues can stretch to over a hundred thousand customers daily and once a shopper gets to the front, they have just 10 minutes to make a purchase.

""We are working around the clock to ensure orders are fulfilled,"" said Mondelez spokesman David Mills.

Rivals face similar issues.

Thorntons had paused taking new orders on its website on Thursday, while Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli said this week that delivery times had been extended to a week and directed shoppers towards grocery suppliers and Amazon as alternatives.

Lindt said the closure of many of its stores and fewer people using airports had hit its business, but it had seen a rise in e-commerce sales, offering home delivery and pick-up services.

Data from Mintel showed British spending on Easter gifts reached 1.14 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) last year, with half of customers buying chocolate treats during one of the busiest periods in the UK chocolate market calendar.

Dutch company Tony's Chocolonely said sales on its UK website had been about 10 times higher than normal as Britons sought solace in chocolate during the lockdown. But it has found its large retail customers focusing more on supplies of household essentials.

""I think (Easter eggs are)... definitely being de-prioritised especially by the retailers,"" said Ben Greensmith, Tony's UK country manager.

Forced to call off the public outdoor egg hunts it organises at beauty spots with the National Trust, Cadbury has tried to move the tradition online instead.

It is inviting people with Easter egg to display their favourite hiding places around the home by posting pictures on social media.

645,2020-03-30T23:02:07+00:00,Buying What the Fed Buys,"On Monday, March 23, the Federal Reserve announced a series of aggressive stimulus measures to combat the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy.

""Aggressive effort must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and income and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,"" the Fed said in a press release. The stimulus measures include the following:

Unlimited purchasing of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Lending up to $300 billion to employers, consumers and businesses. Establishing additional credit facilities to lend to large employers. Increasing the flow of credit to municipalities. Establishing a facility to lend to certain small and medium-sized businesses. Purchasing investment-grade corporate bonds.

Businesses that receive Fed support through any of the above measures are likely to recover more quickly from the economic crisis. This is especially true now that the central bank is purchasing corporate debt, which will make things easier for specific companies more than the economy at large.

When there is a large uptick in demand for a company's assets, share prices will typically rise. Thus, regardless of whether U.S. stocks have hit the bottom or whether they still have room to fall before recovering, investors may want to consider buying what the Fed is buying when it comes to debt and equity markets.

Corporate debt

When purchasing corporate debt, the Fed is not likely to pick and choose which debt it buys based on a company's long-term stock price prospects, as doing so would serve to unbalance the economy more than help it.

Instead, the central bank has pledged to purchase up to 20% of the assets of U.S.-listed bond exchange-traded funds, which provide broad, passive exposure to investment-grade bonds. ETFs also have the advantage of being more liquid than bonds, which is an essential quality when the goal is to stimulate markets as quickly as possible.

Story continues

In general, securities listed on ETFs tend to trade at higher prices relative to intrinsic value than their non-ETF counterparts. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the companies whose common stock together makes up approximately 18% of the S&P 500 Index, all have trailing 12-month price-earnings ratios above 20 as of March 30. Of the five, only Apple has a current price-earnings ratio below 20 at 19.98. 3753a77c6888bbb89a73003a90ac5854.png

With the central bank potentially boosting the demand for bond ETFs by up to 20%, any of these ETFs that it purchases will most likely see a corresponding increase in value. In light of this, which bond ETFs is the Fed most likely to purchase?

One likely candidate is the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond (LQD) ETF, which purchases investment-grade corporate bonds that have a weighted average maturity of around 13 years. With a market cap of $38.08 billion and a dividend yield of 3.39%, the LQD ETF is up 3% over the past year and down approximately 6% since U.S. markets peaked in mid-February. 43a4b86986ab9b7e6657d4b85a51a705.png

The iShares ETFs are run by BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, which has agreed to cooperate with the New York Fed by not charging it fees on its ETFs. There are also plans for BlackRock to lead two corporate credit facilities for the Fed, one for existing bonds and one for new bonds.

The iShares 1-3 Year Credit Bond ETF (NASDAQ:IGSB) is another BlackRock ETF for investment-grade corporate bonds, focusing on shorter-term debt with an average remaining maturity of one to three years. It has a market cap of $12.63 billion and a dividend yield of 3.13%. The ETF is up 1% over the past year and down 3% since mid-February. 8d41334a10f3c260870482b8efd70061.png

Other investment-grade corporate bond ETFs include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCIT) ETF, the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCSH) ETF and the SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond (SPIB) ETF.

Top of the ETFs

In terms of specific companies, the ones that will benefit the most from these bond ETF purchases are the ones that are present in these ETFs. Naturally, companies without investment-grade debt will not benefit from this form of monetary stimulus.

The largest company holdings of the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and several similar ETFs are the big six U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS). While the current target interest rate of 0% to 0.25% does not bode well for the short-term profitability of banks, the banking industry will likely see gains again if the Fed eventually raises interest rates.

Other top investment-grade corporate bond ETF holdings include Apple, Microsoft, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). These giants are on the forefront of tech and communications infrastructure, and their common stocks are also common ETF holdings.

Non-cyclical consumer companies also take up a significant portion of these ETFs. For example, three of the top 10 bonds of the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF are for CVS Health Corp. (CVS). AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) bonds hold a top 10 spot in several of this type of ETF, including the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF.

Venturing into stocks

Some analysts speculate that in addition to corporate debt ETFs, the Fed will follow the Bank of Japan's lead and enter the stock market by purchasing shares of common stock, most likely through ETFs as well.

A ""whatever it takes"" attitude could possibly lead to this, if existing stimulus measures are not enough. After all, with interest rates at zero, the Fed's most powerful economic stimulus tool has already been exhausted.

On the March 6 meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, a board of economists that watches over Fed activities, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said, ""We should allow the central bank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets.""

Keep in mind that this possibility is completely speculative as of the writing of this article. Before the Fed could buy stocks, it would need to get congressional approval. However, with the Fed unleashing unprecedented stimulus measures, some analysts speculate that it will become even more aggressive in its policies if markets continue to worsen.

Conclusion

With the Fed becoming active in the economy at unprecedented levels, investors may need to give the institution some weight in their considerations of the companies that will be affected by its decisions.

Long story short, the Fed becoming involved enough in corporate debt to buy up to 20% of investment-grade corporate debt ETFs means that investment-grade companies will be getting a leg up over those with lower credit ratings. This comes at a time when increasing corporate debt in the U.S. has led to waves of credit downgrades, meaning that debt is becoming more concentrated at the top.

646,2020-03-27T06:12:13+00:00,"WeDoctor to Pick JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, CMB for IPO","(Bloomberg) -- WeDoctor, one of China’s biggest online health-care startups, has selected JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International to lead a Hong Kong initial public offering, people familiar with the deal said.

The startup could become one of the largest technology companies to brave volatile public markets in 2020. WeDoctor envisions raising at least $500 million and as much as $1 billion, one of the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing a private deal. The details could change given that deliberations are ongoing, the people said. More banks may be invited to join the deal in future, one person said.

WeDoctor, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., joins a growing contingent of tech giants hoping to revolutionize a traditional health-care industry after the coronavirus pandemic underscored its shortcomings. The company is on the prowl for expansion capital and last month laid the foundation for a public debut by hiring finance overseer John Cai, formerly chief executive for AIA Group Ltd.’s operations in markets including China, Malaysia and Vietnam.

The startup, whose business spans insurance policies and medical supplies to online appointment-booking and clinics, was last valued at around $5.5 billion. It’s said to be targeting a float in late 2020 or 2021.

WeDoctor, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse representatives declined to comment. A CMB representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. IFR first reported on the selection.

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought inadequacies in the country’s medical care system into stark relief, exposing an over-reliance on big hospitals in major cities and flaws in how the state responds to emergencies, even with a mechanism built after the SARS outbreak in 2003. The startup has said it launched an online platform dedicated to treating coronavirus cases on Jan. 23 and has helped facilitate 1.4 million consultations with doctors in the month since it began.

Story continues

Longer term, startups like WeDoctor could play a pivotal role in a nationwide effort to wrench its ailing healthcare sector into the modern age. Beijing envisions a 16 trillion yuan ($2.3 trillion) healthcare industry by 2030 and, in a blueprint laid out in 2016 called “Healthy China 2030,” vowed to improve public health emergency preparedness and response capabilities to match those of developed countries.

Founded by artificial intelligence maven Jerry Liao Jieyuan in 2010, WeDoctor aims to compete with both fellow startups and major corporations such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in the burgeoning field of online healthcare.

It needs capital to expand. It has yet to decide whether to include its cloud business -- where sensitive patient information and government data reside -- in the envisioned Hong Kong public offering, people familiar with the matter have said.

WeDoctor counts China Development Bank Capital, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. and AIA as backers. The company said in a statement it connects 360,000 doctors with some 210 million registered users.

647,2019-12-20T15:15:00+00:00,Mirakl Bolsters Global Leadership Team with 4 New Marketplace Sales & Strategy Experts,"BOSTON and PARIS and LONDON and MUNICH, Germany, Dec.  20, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mirakl, the leading global marketplace solutions provider, today announced the addition of four veteran sales and marketplace strategy experts to its senior team. The move comes on the heels of a year of stellar growth and bolsters the company’s leadership as it ramps up to meet growing demand for its marketplace platform solutions.

Mirakl welcomed two seasoned sales executives to its global team: Brian Callahan as Executive Vice President of Sales – Americas/APAC and Brendan Walsh as Executive Vice President of Sales – EMEA. Retail digital commerce and data analytics expert Tzipi Avioz also joined Mirakl earlier this year as Executive Vice President of Customer Success – Americas and APAC. And, former Amazon Marketplace executive Luca Cassina was named Executive Vice President of Customer Success EMEA.

Callahan comes to Mirakl from Demandware (acquired by Salesforce in 2016 for $3 billion), where he joined as an early stage employee and stayed on for 12 years in multiple roles with increasing responsibility. His impressive track record and ability to scale will drive customer acquisition in the Mirakl sales organization and growth within target regions.

Walsh joins Mirakl from Zuora (NYSE: ZUO), where he led sales in EMEA for nearly seven years. Long-immersed in digital transformation, Walsh has been instrumental in driving the subscription model revolution that now powers the SaaS industry through Zuora’s industry-leading subscription billing platform. Part of the team who pioneered “the greatest sales deck I’ve ever seen,” according to strategic messaging expert Andy Raskin, Walsh’s hands-on experience in executing a team-based sales approach has proven to deliver high-value deals in industries known for long and complex sales cycles. In addition to Zuora, Walsh has a long track record of success working with recurring revenue businesses within the Oracle, Microsoft and HP ecosystems.

Once a Mirakl customer, Avioz implemented a Mirakl-powered Marketplace where she saw first-hand the strength of the company’s focus on customer success as a key differentiator. Avioz brings more than 20 years of experience in digital data analytics, executing large digital transformation projects and digital-focused customer success for retail. In addition to a decade with Woolworths as head of Digital Commerce & Contact Centres, she was most recently Technology & Operation Director for AMP, the leading independent wealth management company in Australia and New Zealand. Previously, she also served as the CIO for the Tiv Taam Group, an Israeli supermarket chain.

Cassina comes to Mirakl with over 20 years of experience in retail, eCommerce and digital payments. In his previous role as Fashion Marketplace Director, Amazon Europe (NASDAQ: AMZN), he spent over two years overseeing the Seller Services Team in all fashion and accessories categories, leading a multinational team in six countries. Previously, he held various senior leadership roles at PayPal over a decade, including Managing Director for Western Europe and General Manager for Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. He also spent five years in digital media as general manager at both Schibsted Classified Media and TalentManager.com.

“With these extremely talented strategists on board, Mirakl is even better positioned to help B2B and B2C organizations become leaders in the Platform Revolution,” said Adrien Nussenbaum, U.S. CEO and co-founder of Mirakl. “Bolstering our sales and customer success programs further differentiates Mirakl as the undisputed leader in marketplace solutions, with both the technology and expertise to help our customers drive growth by platforming their business.”

652,2019-03-12T12:00:00+00:00,Major Players in the Bottled Water Space,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March  12, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With U.S. bottled water sales volumes reaching roughly 13.7 billion gallons in 2017 according to Statista, the United States presents the world’s largest consumer market for bottled water products.

In this report, we examine how some of the world’s largest retailers are leveraging both private and national water labels to grow their bottled water market share—a market that will likely become increasingly valuable as new, innovative product offerings such as CBD-infused water (aka hemp-extract water) become available.

The Alkaline Water Company: A Growing National Brand

The Alkaline Water Company (NASDAQ and TSXV: WTER), a leading producer of premium bottled alkaline drinking water sold under the brand name Alkaline88®, recently announced its expansion into all Whole Foods Southwest Stores.

With 30 new Whole Foods stores now carrying Alkaline88®’s 1-gallon size, Alkaline88® is available in over 100 Whole Foods locations nationwide. The Alkaline Water Company expects its products be in all Whole Foods stores by the end of company’s 2020 fiscal year - and as you know, Whole Foods is now owned by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

To ensure that it can satisfy the demands of its growing organic consumer base, the Alkaline Water Company has also recently announced a partnership with international flavor house The Ungerer Company. Through this partnership, the Alkaline Water Company can leverage Ungerer’s cutting-edge flavor technology to develop the company’s low calorie, naturally flavored A88 Infused Beverage products—including the company’s forthcoming hemp-extract water.

Via The Alkaline Water Company:

“. . . Ungerer has taken their skills to another level and solved the impossible; they have created a great tasting flavoring to use in our hemp-extract water. This product is low in calories, high in all-natural flavors, and does not have a 'hemp' after-taste,” concluded Mr. Wright [President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company].”

As the second fastest growing branded water among the top 20 brands in the U.S., Alkaline88® provides the Alkaline Water Company with an unrivalled platform to launch its hemp-infused product line, which includes sparkling flavored hemp-infused alkaline water and hemp-infused Alkaline88® original.

With the Company’s hemp-infused beverages continuing to roll out over the course of the following weeks, the Alkaline Water Company is expected be the first national U.S. beverage company—and the first NASDAQ-listed company—to bring premium, hemp-infused alkaline water to U.S. consumers - attacking one of the biggest potential beverage categories in the coming years: CBD-infused drinks.

Alkaline88® is already sold in over 47,500 retail locations nationwide in all 50 states, with a distribution that spans more than 150,000 stores, including 9 of the top 10 largest retailers in the entire U.S., such as Whole Foods, and two of the largest retailers in the world such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Krogers (NYSE: KR).

Walmart

As the world’s largest company by revenue, Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) serves nearly 270 million customers a week through more than 11,700 stores across 28 countries.

In 2018, the company recorded revenue of over $500 billion—and it appears that bottled water may deserve some of the credit.

Via Thinknum:

“Of the 15 types of bottled water that Walmart [sells], every single one of them ranks in the top-100 products sold . . .”

While bottled sparkling, antioxidant-infused, and alkaline water products make up a significant portion of Walmart’s highest consumer rated water products, Walmart’s commitment to a “Everyday low price” (EDLP) pricing strategy has helped Sam’s Choice—the Company’s discounted, private labelled water brand—become its best-selling bottled water product.

Thinknum continues:

“. . . Sam's Choice — Walmart's in-house brand — takes the top four spots of [Walmart’s] most-sold bottled-water products . . .”

The popularity of Sam’s Choice comes as little surprise, especially considering Walmart’s cost-sensitive retail culture. However, its broad appeal comes at the cost of alienating some of today’s stickiest consumers—specifically those that prefer more premium, health conscious products. It's worth noting that the Alkaline Water Company's (NASDAQ: WTER and TSX-V: WTER) are sold in Walmart stores across the country.

Amazon & Whole Foods

With its acquisition of Whole Foods back in 2017, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the world’s largest e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing platform as measured by revenue and market capitalization, is quickly emerging as one of the world’s largest water retailers. Last January, Amazon had announced that net sales for the company had increased 31% to $232.9 billion for the full year 2018.

Much like Walmart, Amazon has created its own private label bottled water in hopes of capturing the cost-sensitive consumer.

Via Inc.:

“. . . Amazon is selling 12 packs of 365 Everyday Value flavored sparkling water at a deep discount for Amazon Prime members . . .

""The deal highlights how Amazon is using Whole Foods . . . to go after some of the hottest brands in consumer-packaged goods . . . Whole Foods introduced 365-branded canned sparkling water in September 2017, a month after Amazon closed the acquisition.”

But while Amazon’s “365 Everyday Value” branded water products attempts to capture market share in the same way as Walmart’s Sam’s Choice, it too fails to command a premium price like other national label water products.

Kroger

The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR), the largest grocery chain in the United States, recently announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and 2018 fiscal year. The results were less-than-stellar.

For the fourth quarter ended February 2, net earnings fell from $854 million to $259 million, a 70% decrease. Total sales fell 1.2% to $121.2 billion in 2018 compared to $122.7 billion in 2017.

Despite missing analyst earnings targets, Kroger Chairman and CEO William R. McMullen believes that the company has successfully laid the groundwork to hit its 2020 Restock Krogertargets.

Via Supermarket News:

“The ‘Restock Kroger’ initiative will involve an accelerated and more data-driven effort around pricing, personalized communications with customers and a massive revamp of product assortments . . .”

One product assortment undergoing significant change happens to be beverages.

Supermarket News continues:

“We’ve reinvented what beverage sections look like,” said Stuart Aitkin, CEO of Kroger’s 84.51° data analytics division. “We need to make sure our stores stay relevant.”

Though clearly resource intensive, bold initiatives like ‘Restock Kroger,’ are key to staying in touch with today’s rapidly changing consumer preferences. It's again worth noting that Kroger's also carries Alkaline88®.

Costco

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), the world’s largest retailer after Walmart, recently reported its fiscal second quarter results. The results beat analyst expectations; net sales for the quarter increased 7.3%, to $34.63 billion from $32.28 billion last year, while net income for the quarter came in at $889 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $701 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, last year.

Much of Costco’s growth can be attributed to its Kirkland Signature private label brand—a rare example of a private label done right.

Via Business Insider:

“ . . . Kirkland accounted for nearly a third of all Costco's [2018] sales. Customers see the brand [Kirkland] as a blend of quality and value, and it gives shoppers a unique reason to go to Costco that other retailers can't match — online or off.”

While Costco’s Kirkland Signature brand presents a real challenge to many of today’s national labels, its bottled water products sacrifice innovation for affordability—like so many of today’s other private bottled water brands. But it certainly seems to work.

Private Water Brands Lack 'Premium' Consumer Appeal

Though major retailers are investing in the growth of private label water brands like never before, it appears that “in-house” retailer water brands have still failed to capture the premium consumer.

Via Grocery Dive:

“According to the firm's and the Food Marketing Institute's 'Power of Private Brands' report released this summer, dollar share of grocery private label in the premium (24%), value (18%) and organic (6%) segments has remained unchanged since 2015 despite shifting industry economics.”

This is largely due to the fact that private label water brands have historically focused on value over innovation. However, they may not have to create products for the premium market. The Big Box Retailers, such as Walmart and Kroger, have the added benefit of not only selling their own private-label value brands, but selling premium and innovative brands, such as the Alkaline Water Company’s Alkaline88®.

Furthermore, the CBD/hemp-infused segment is expected to be one of the hottest beverage trends in the coming years, but its launch still comes with jurisdictional risk. The Big Box Retailers can let the smaller, more nimble companies – such as the Alkaline Water Company – figure it out first, and then carry their products later when it becomes more mainstream.

653,2019-03-11T12:27:00+00:00,"DirectView Enters Smart Home Market with Google Home, Nest, & Amazon Ring Products","DirectView’s online e-commerce site ApexCCTV.com Records Increase In Orders And Revenue of 172% And 185%, Respectively.

NEW YORK, March  11, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  DirectView Holdings, Inc. (OTC:DIRV) (“DirectView” or the “Company”), a company focused on ownership and management of leading video and security technology companies, today announced that it has entered the Smart Home market with Google Home, Nest, and Ring Doorbell products driving record-breaking sales through the Company’s wholly-owned e-retailer website, ApexCCTV.com.

ApexCCTV has noted consistent growth since the redesigned platform went live last year. Total inbound traffic to the e-commerce website has increased by 43%. As a supplier, ApexCCTV has the ability to offer the most competitive pricing on the internet. The addition of Smart Home Products like Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) “Home”, “Nest”, and Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) “Ring” doorbell products have been strong contributing factors for ApexCCTV’s record-breaking increase in orders and revenue of 172% and 185%, respectively. In an effort to further this growth, ApexCCTV.com will be adding roughly 2,300 new products in the coming weeks, doubling the size of its product catalog.

According to Markets and Markets in the report titled: Smart Home Market by Product - Global Forecast to 2024, the overall smart home market is expected to grow from USD 76.6 billion in 2018 to USD 151.4 billion by 2024, at a CAGR of 12.02%. The growth in the smart home market will be driven by the adoption of smart devices and a widespread concern about safety, security, and convenience. DirectView and ApexCCTV (together as leading providers of Security, Surveillance, and Smart Home equipment), and Virtual Surveillance, LLC., (as the seasoned installer), possess the synergies necessary to become a prominent provider and installer of smart home technology.

Roger Ralston, President and CEO of DirectView, said, “We are experiencing an ever-growing demand for DirectView’s products and services, not solely in security and surveillance, but in other market segments like smart home and home automation.

659,2018-08-27T16:35:00+00:00,AWS and VMware Announce Amazon Relational Database Service on VMware,"LAS VEGAS, Aug.  27, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today at VMworld 2018, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), and VMware (NYSE:VMW), announced Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) on VMware. Amazon RDS on VMware is a service that will make it easy for customers to set up, operate, and scale databases in VMware-based software-defined data centers and hybrid environments and to migrate them to AWS or VMware Cloud on AWS. Amazon RDS on VMware automates database management regardless of where the database is deployed, freeing up customers to focus on developing and tuning their applications. Available in the coming months, Amazon RDS on VMware will support Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB databases. To learn more about Amazon RDS on VMware, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/vmware.

Relational databases support practically all of the world's business-critical systems operating on-premises. Provisioning, patching, backing up, cloning, restoring, scaling, and monitoring these databases is tedious, expensive, and risky – any mistake can lead to extended application downtime. And, it is even more difficult to set up and manage databases for high availability, replicating data across multiple nodes. Self-managed databases in VMware environments face these same challenges, plus for every database, customers need to create the database image, install the operating system, install packages, and set up the database. Supporting multiple versions and patching becomes cumbersome across an organization, especially as versions, configurations, and extensions drift with the growth of business. When security, compliance, and auditing requirements are added, the time spent on database fleet maintenance becomes a significant cost and distraction.

For the past nine years, Amazon RDS has been alleviating the pain of database management for hundreds of thousands of customers, delivering high availability, durability, and security for databases running in AWS. Amazon RDS on VMware will bring this same experience to VMware-based data centers. Amazon RDS on VMware manages databases from ground to cloud, enabling access to AWS through a single, simple interface. Amazon RDS on VMware automates database provisioning, operating system and database patching, backup, point-in-time restore, storage and compute scaling, instance health monitoring, and failover. Customers can also use Amazon RDS for VMware to enable low-cost, high-availability hybrid deployments, database disaster recovery to AWS, read replica bursting to Amazon RDS in the AWS Cloud, and long-term database archival in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

“Managing the administrative and operational muck of databases is hard work, error-prone, and resource intensive,” said Andy Jassy, Chief Executive Officer, Amazon Web Services. “It’s why hundreds of thousands of customers trust Amazon RDS to manage their databases at scale. We’re excited to bring this same operationally battle-tested service to VMware customers’ on-premises and hybrid environments, which will not only make database management much easier for enterprises, but also make it simpler for these databases to transition to the cloud.”

“When we originally partnered on VMware Cloud on AWS, our message was clear – we’re giving customers what they want, the best of both worlds from the leaders in private and public cloud. With Amazon RDS for VMware, we’re doing it again,” said Pat Gelsinger, Chief Executive Officer, VMware. “This time we’re taking innovation from AWS and bringing it to the hundreds of thousands of customers that have made VMware their private cloud infrastructure of choice. With this offering from AWS and VMware, end users and database administrators alike now have access to a cloud-like database management experience, in whatever environment they choose to run – private or public cloud. This type of game-changing innovation shows the depth of the partnership VMware and AWS have, and the mutual commitment to listening to customers and delivering new and unimaginable value to help drive their digital transformation.”

Available in the coming months, Amazon RDS on VMware will support Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB databases.

665,2018-04-04T13:00:00+00:00,Robin Cloud Platform announced as the First and Only Container Solution certified to run Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP),"SAN JOSE, Calif., April  04, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robin Systems, the only container-based Application-Defined Infrastructure (ADI) software provider, announced today that Robin Cloud Platform is the First and Only container solution that has been certified to run Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP®) solution. Robin Cloud Platform significantly simplifies the deployment, management and consolidation of the containerized Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP®) solution; on-premise or in the cloud.

“Hortonworks recognizes the multiple benefits of Docker container technologies when compared to virtual machines and how Robin Cloud Platform best enables the use of Containers for complex data-heavy pipelines. Since Robin was the first Container solution to be tested for HDP certification, we dedicated our own QA team to put Robin Cloud Platform’s HDP support through a rigorous suite of tests across all components and aspects of our platform. Hortonworks is excited about this collaboration and looks forward to working with Hortonworks support subscribers who choose the Robin Cloud Platform for their HDP deployment.” said Scott Andress, Vice President, Global Channels & Alliances, Hortonworks.

Unlike other solutions in the market that target only container orchestration, Robin Cloud Platform addresses the entire application IO path – a more complete view allowing application workflows to auto-configure the compute, network, storage layers. This is a key differentiation in supporting data-intensive applications like Hortonworks HDP that require fine tuning of all infrastructure layers to get the best performance and reliability. Robin’s architecture enables IT teams to meet the most demanding requirements for SLAs and performance isolation between HDP services even in a shared infrastructure environment, while letting development and scientific user teams enjoy an app-store experience with 1-click self-service workflows to deploy, scale and manage HDP clusters.

Robin’s architecture differentiation also applies to all Big-Data, NoSQL and RDBMS applications like Cassandra, MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, IBM-Db2 and SAP-HANA. In fact, Robin Cloud Platform has the broadest support of enterprise data apps in the market, is the only solution that lets you share resources across multiple applications and users while guaranteeing performance isolation and the only solution that slashes deployment, as well as management times from days to minutes.

“We are honored to be the first and only Hortonworks’ certified partner designed and optimized for container technology. We specifically architected Robin Cloud Platform for complex distributed applications like HDP that need much more than just Docker containers with storage plugin in order to meet production deployment and support requirements. I am happy to see this validated by Hortonworks testing as this is good peace of mind for our customers deploying HDP atop Robin Cloud Platform.” said Premal Buch, CEO of Robin Systems.

Robin Cloud Platform is a Container-based pure software solution that sits between the application and the infrastructure and enables 1-click application workflows for the user by letting the applications auto-configure storage, compute and networking across on-premise and cloud-based environments. It has REST APIs and hooks to interface with the rest of the ecosystem and requires no changes to the applications.

Robin also offers two Free editions: 1. 5-Day Free Trial with unlimited scale, scope and a full feature set, and 2. Free for life Community Edition (CE) with a full feature set with up to five Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) AMIs of any type or size.

The RT100 is based on more than 230,000 individual ratings collected in the first quarter of 2018. It includes comparative rankings, demographic trends, and unique insights into the dynamics behind reputational impact. The global study shows what drives trust and identifies supportive behaviors such as intent to purchase a company’s products, willingness to invest in, or even work for, the company.

Rankings dropped for 58 percent of companies in the RT100. Aligned with the decline in reputation, garnering support among stakeholders has become more difficult for companies; expectations have risen, making it harder to earn trust, attain benefit of the doubt, create consumer loyalty and entice investors.

“The reputation bubble has burst. Companies are down by an average of 1.4 points globally, representing the first major decline since the end of the Great Recession,” said Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, Executive Partner and Chief Research Officer for Reputation Institute.

 RI measures the reputation of thousands of companies on an annual basis using its RepTrak® framework. Its Global RT100 study measures the most highly regarded and familiar multinational companies in 15 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Denny’s skill for Amazon Alexa voice ordering is now live, allowing Denny’s guests to place their order directly via Amazon Alexa from the comfort of their own home. After enabling the skill in the Alexa app and linking their Denny’s account and payment information, customers can simply speak command prompts that will activate Amazon’s cloud-based voice service, Alexa. The skill also allows guests to re-order recent menu items and provide estimated pick-up times. From there, the order will be sent directly to their nearby Denny’s restaurant, whether for pickup or delivery (at participating restaurants).

“Since our launch of Denny’s on Demand last May, we have seen a clear and growing demand for greater convenience from our guests,” said John Dillon, chief marketing officer for Denny’s.  “Our digital ordering sales are continuing to grow, and we are seeing the benefit that digital ordering technology is bringing to both our restaurants and our guests.  We are pleased to continue building on our momentum, offering more and more of our guests a taste of Denny’s available at their fingertips with the introduction of ordering by Alexa.”

Since its inception, Denny’s on Demand has been delivering guests the convenience they crave along with the diner classics they love, whenever and wherever they want it – to the tune of more than 1.3 million orders to date. The platform continues to offer guests an entirely new approach to online ordering, enabling users to fully customize and place an order of any breakfast, lunch, dinner or late-night dish from Denny’s extensive diner menu, any time of day or night, all from the convenience of their smartphone, tablet or Amazon Alexa.

Denny’s on Demand is powered by Olo, with voice ordering through Alexa powered by Conversable.

669,2017-11-28T13:00:00+00:00,VMware and AWS Expand Capabilities and Availability of VMware Cloud on AWS,"LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - November 28, 2017) - Today at AWS re:Invent 2017, VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced VMware Cloud™ on AWS is expanding availability from the U.S. West (Oregon) region to also include the AWS U.S. East (N. Virginia) region, and includes additional VMware capabilities and support for more AWS services, making it even easier for customers to move, run, and protect mission-critical applications at scale. For more information about VMware Cloud on AWS, visit: http://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws.

""The momentum for VMware Cloud on AWS is growing rapidly, and VMware and AWS are delivering major new capabilities after only three months of availability while enhancing our strategic relationship with new integrations across our platforms,"" said Mark Lohmeyer, vice president and general manager, Cloud Platform Business Unit, VMware. ""Customers of VMware Cloud on AWS will be able to migrate application portfolios to the cloud even more rapidly with Hybrid Cloud Extension and AWS Direct Connect, while maintaining the optimal levels of performance, scale, and availability required for mission-critical apps.""

""We are pleased to extend availability of VMware Cloud on AWS to the AWS U.S. East region. Both teams have been really focused on quickly iterating to provide the capabilities that our customers have told us they want,"" said Sandy Carter, vice president, Enterprise Workloads for Amazon Web Services. ""In addition to the availability, networking, and security features that will further support production workloads, we're excited to extend native integrations with AWS Direct Connect.""

Scripps Networks Interactive is a leading provider of lifestyle content in the home, food, and travel categories for television, the internet, and emerging platforms. ""We have a significant footprint with both VMware and AWS, and our goal is to create a hybrid cloud model that will seamlessly integrate our existing VMware infrastructure with our strategic public cloud, AWS,"" said Drew Fredrick, vice president, IT Cloud & Infrastructure Services, Scripps Networks Interactive. ""VMware Cloud on AWS will allow us to move, modernize, protect, and scale our applications, and expand the value of these applications with native AWS services. Having VMware vSphere at the core of the service means we get operational consistency with our on-premises environment, enabling us to maximize our existing IT skillsets and tools.""

With VMware vSphere® vMotion®, new L2 stretched networking features, and AWS Direct Connect, customers will be able to migrate applications from their on premises VMWare cluster into VMware on AWS without any disruptions to the application, and without having to make any changes to the network configuration. Customers will also be able also use AWS Direct Connect for high-speed, reliable, and private network connectivity, supporting faster cold and live application migration with vMotion.

VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension™, an add-on SaaS offering for VMware Cloud on AWS, will provide large-scale migration between on-premises environments running vSphere 5.0+ and VMware Cloud on AWS with no replatforming, retesting, or change in tooling. Hybrid Cloud Extension will provide built in high performance Layer 2 extensions so customers will be able to keep the same networks, IP, and routing policies in place while moving workloads. This eliminates the need for extensive application dependency mapping when migrating applications to VMware Cloud on AWS.

With VMware Site Recovery, customers can lower capital expenditures by eliminating the need for a secondary disaster recovery site, streamline operations with automated orchestration, enable failover and failback with familiar management tools, and increase disaster readiness with non-disruptive, on-demand testing available anytime.

Scale, Security, and Visibility for Mission-Critical Applications VMware and AWS are expanding the scale, network connectivity, and security capabilities of VMware Cloud on AWS to further support the most resource intensive applications such as Oracle, Oracle RAC, Microsoft SQL Server, Apache Spark and Hadoop.

This will enable a single customer to support environments as large as tens of thousands of VMs. Customer SDDC environments run on a high-performance, dedicated, and highly secure next-generation AWS hardware infrastructure.

Strategic Alliance Between Private and Public Cloud Leaders Delivers a Seamlessly Integrated Hybrid CloudEarly Access and Beta Customers include Brink's, Cerner, Elemica, MIT, Moody's, State of Louisiana, and Sysco

Today at VMworld® 2017, VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the initial availability of VMware Cloud™ on AWS. Born out of the strategic alliance announced in October 2016, VMware Cloud on AWS brings VMware's software-defined data center (SDDC) to the AWS Cloud, allowing customers to run applications across operationally consistent VMware vSphere®-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments, with optimized access to AWS services. VMware Cloud on AWS is delivered, sold, and supported by VMware as an on-demand, elastically-scalable cloud service that removes barriers to cloud migration and cloud portability, increases IT efficiency, and opens up new opportunities for customers to leverage a hybrid cloud environment. To get started with VMware Cloud on AWS, visit http://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws.

Customers across industries are accelerating adoption of AWS Cloud and VMware infrastructure, and many of them want the ability to seamlessly integrate their on-premises data center environments with AWS using their existing tools and skillsets within a common operating environment based on familiar VMware software. VMware Cloud on AWS delivers on this promise, with a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud that extends on-premises vSphere environments to a VMware SDDC running on AWS elastic, bare-metal infrastructure.

""VMware and AWS are empowering enterprise IT and operations teams to add value to their businesses through the combination of VMware enterprise capabilities and the breadth and depth of capabilities and scale of the AWS Cloud, providing them a platform for any application,"" said Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer, VMware. ""VMware Cloud on AWS gives customers a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud that delivers the same architecture, capabilities, and operational experience across both their vSphere-based on-premises environment and AWS.""

""With the availability of VMware Cloud on AWS, for the first time customers can operate a consistent and seamless hybrid IT environment that combines the VMware software they love with the unmatched functionality, security, and operational expertise of the AWS Cloud,"" said Andy Jassy, chief executive officer, AWS. ""The majority of the world's enterprises have virtualized their data centers with VMware, and now these customers can easily move applications between their on-premises environments and AWS without having to purchase any new hardware, rewrite their applications, or modify their operations.""

VMware Cloud on AWS is powered by VMware Cloud Foundation™, the unified SDDC platform that integrates vSphere, VMware VSAN™, and VMware NSX® virtualization technologies with VMware vCenter® management. This means customers can use familiar VMware tools to manage their applications, without having to purchase any new or custom hardware, rewrite applications, or modify their operating model. With VMware Cloud on AWS, customers can leverage AWS's breadth of services, including compute, databases, analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), security, mobile, deployment, application services, and more.

VMware Cloud on AWS is ideal for customers looking to migrate applications to the public cloud, develop entirely new applications, extend the capacity of their data centers for existing applications, or quickly provision development and test environments. It will also support containerized workloads and DevOps services such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and others. VMware and AWS plan to continue to innovate together to add new capabilities and additional AWS regions to support customers that want to use VMware Cloud on AWS for disaster recovery, data center consolidation, and geographic expansion.

The service is initially available in the AWS US West (Oregon) region and will expand to AWS regions worldwide in 2018. Today customers can consume this service hourly and pay only for each hour that a host is active in their account. Pricing and requirements can be found at http://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/pricing. VMware will make one-year and three-year subscription options available in the future. VMware's Hybrid Loyalty Program will provide discounts to customers with on-premises VMware vSphere, NSX, and/or vSAN licenses. The pricing model, combined with the VMware Hybrid Loyalty Program discounts, will offer very attractive TCO benefits on a per-VM basis to both VMware and AWS customers.
