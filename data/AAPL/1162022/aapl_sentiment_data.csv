The SoftBank-backed company has promoted Peter Sirota, a former executive at Amazon.com Inc.’s Web Services business who joined Mapbox three years ago, to the top job. He replaces Eric Gundersen, who has been with the company since its start in 2010 and now becomes chief strategy officer and chairman of the board.

The San Francisco-based startup is taking on Alphabet Inc.’s Google Maps as it tries to establish itself as the center of car navigation systems. Mapbox inked a deal with BMW Group for in-car navigation last year. It’s looking to unveil deals with a half-dozen additional carmakers this year, said a person familiar with the plans.

Sirota will also need to eventually return the company to break-even. Earlier in its lifespan, Mapbox turned a modest profit by focusing on nonprofits and governments. The levels of investment required for the auto and logistics industries took Mapbox into the red in recent years. Still, the company has raised about $150 million from SoftBank and is valued at more than $1 billion, said the person familiar with the business who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Revenue is on track to exceed $100 million this year, the person said.

A main competitor of Mapbox, as Sirota sees it, is the smartphone. About 700 million people interact with a Mapbox service each month, he said. Google Maps has more than 1 billion monthly users.

Mapbox can be better than a smartphone app by using information from a car’s sensors, Sirota said. For example, if a vehicle is running out of fuel, it can highlight the location of nearby gas stations. For electric cars, it can incorporate range data and plan routes based on the location of charging stations.

One of Sirota’s goals is to establish the car as the main input for directions before people form a lasting habit of pulling up Google or Apple maps on their phones. “Now is a very important moment,” Sirota said. “This opportunity has a window in it, so we have to get there fast.”

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: Well, the Oracle of Omaha has issued his annual letter to shareholders, and the letter disclosed some of Berkshire's top holdings, which includes the electric car-maker, BYD, and also Yahoo Finance's parent company, Verizon. And the letter also reminded everyone to never bet against America. We have Jonathan Boyar here with us to break it down. Jonathan is principal and portfolio manager at Boyar Asset Management. So Jonathan, we have the letter. I'm wondering what some of your biggest takeaways were from it.

JONATHAN BOYAR: First, thank you for having me on the show. It was an interesting letter, but, I mean, I think a lot of people probably expected too much out of the letter for him to express societal, you know, view on what's happened over the past year in terms of politics, et cetera. I mean, I think that's not his style. But I thought it was, you know, I was happy to see that he's committed to buying back shares at the right prices.

Clearly, you know, I don't think there was anything, any major revelations. It would have been nice to hear his thoughts on a potential dividend at some point in time. But I think under his regime, that's not necessarily realistic.

KRISTIN MYERS: Now I was surprised, kind of coming back to this point about folks expecting perhaps a little bit too much out of him this year, I think that's kind of the theme in general after 2020. A lot of folks are expecting a lot out of a lot of people, and out of a lot of companies after the year we had. And I was surprised to see that there wasn't too much reminiscing really over the year of 2020 and of the difficulties or perhaps even some business decisions that could have been made in the face of 2020. Were you surprised to see that as well?

JONATHAN BOYAR: In terms of the business decisions, absolutely. I mean, Warren Buffett, there's no second guessing Warren Buffet. He's the greatest investor of all time. Everyone makes mistakes. And with the benefit of hindsight, obviously, he should have been more aggressive buying common stocks in March, April, May, June this year.

Story continues

KRISTIN MYERS: Right.

JONATHAN BOYAR: Obviously, that's with the benefit of hindsight. I would have loved to have kind of just heard his thoughts on why he wasn't, because he has such a big cash hoard. Why wasn't he more aggressive? There were plenty of big cap stocks for him to have bought that could have moved the needle. And I just would have loved to hear his reasoning behind it.

KRISTIN MYERS: Was there anything that surprised you out of this letter? The letter wasn't full of too many surprises, but I'm wondering if there was anything that really leapt out at you.

JONATHAN BOYAR: I think that was probably it. It wasn't a surprise that he didn't talk about the dividend. I think he's way too tax sensitive to initiate one, although I think it probably would have been the right thing to do. So, no, there was no major surprises. I mean, except for the annual meeting being held virtually and in Los Angeles. But that doesn't really affect very many people. So it was pretty much status quo.

But I would have liked to hear kind of his thoughts on where we go from here, especially with the potential rising interest rate environment. How do investors react to that? I mean, there's a lot, I mean, he's always been very generous with his investment wisdom and as an educator and a teacher, and it would've been nice to have a little bit more of that. But he's given us a lot through the years. So it's really hard to complain.

KRISTIN MYERS: I want to drill down into some of those holdings in the letter. BYD kind of stuck out at me, the electric car-maker. We were talking a little bit earlier with Gareth Soloway, and he kind of raised a little bit of an alarm, or at least a little bit of a flag, because the EV space in general is one that has seen huge run-ups, and then also taken some pretty big legs lower. I was wondering what you made of that holding.

JONATHAN BOYAR: Well, I don't know the size of the holding relative, the exact size. But it's my guess, pretty small relative to the entire market value or the equity portfolio at Berkshire. So I wouldn't read into any individual holdings too much per se. But he's certainly gone out of his comfort zone with Snowflake, Amazon, Apple in the past couple years. So it's not terribly surprising that electric vehicles are on his mind. And it's certainly a theme to invest in. I don't know that much about that individual company to speak intelligently about it.

KRISTIN MYERS: Just for everyone at home, I just pulled up the letter now. Berkshire does own 8.2% of the company. And of course, I think a lot of folks are going to be looking at it since there's a huge battle going on in the electric vehicle space, of course, with companies like Tesla and Nio, as well. I wanted to ask you as well about one other thing, which is the lack of details around succession. You know, we do have Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger getting on in years. And I think a lot of folks are looking to see what is going to be coming in the next couple of years. And yet, a lot of, we got no details on that point there.

JONATHAN BOYAR: Well, you had a little bit of a hint of a detail. He said that the lady from Nebraska Furniture Mart retired early at 103. So maybe that's a hint on how long he intends to stay. And you know, it's a board decision about succession. He doesn't need to telegraph his hand. And I'm not so worried. I mean, I think what Warren Buffett has done, as well as Charlie Munger, is create a company that is so strong and so good that it can run without 'em.

And that's what, not that they don't need capable management going forward, but I don't think it's a central, it should be a central theme. There'll never be another Warren Buffett. What he did is absolutely extraordinary. But what he's done is create a company that might not have one CEO running everything. It might be in different divisions, et cetera. But I don't think investors really should be as focused on that as what capital allocation will be like going forward.

KRISTIN MYERS: And to that point, Mrs. B retired at 103. And in the letter, he said, as judged by him and Charlie, that was a quote, ""ridiculously premature age."" 103 years old.

6,2021-03-01T12:44:12+00:00,5 Top-Rated S&amp;P 500 Growth Stocks to Buy in March,"February turned out to be volatile for the stock market, with the rise in bond yields triggering a selloff among riskier investments like growth-oriented tech stocks toward the end of the month. But despite the rise in bond yields wreaking havoc on the stock market, the benchmarks managed to finish the month in the green. Some analysts by the way believe that the selloff, especially last week, was mostly due to profit-taking, thanks to big gains in the first half of last month.

Nonetheless, all eyes are now on how the stock market will fare in the month of March. Will the market spin the way it did in February and what’s in store for bond yields? Many believe that the stock market may consolidate in March but the increase in bond yields may not impact the markets anymore. No doubt, the 10-year Treasury note and the 30-year Treasury note saw their biggest monthly jump since 2016, per Dow Jones Market Data, as quoted in a MarketWatch article. However, let’s admit that the real adjusted yields are still negative, which should continue to encourage risk-taking in the near future.

Deutsche Bank, in fact, noted that presently there is a new generation of young and confident investors who are eager to invest in stocks more than ever. Per the survey, as pointed out in another MarketWatch article, 62% of the respondents consider stocks good investment, while 25% chose to remain neutral. What’s more, 53% of the respondents expect stocks to scale northward over the next three-month period and 68% believe that stocks will remain lucrative investment options over the next year.

This is because the U.S. economy is certainly looking up again. Consumer outlays improved in the month of January on a rise in income level. Incomes improved on the $600 stimulus checks provided by the government and various other munificent jobless benefits. And with outlays improving, sales of new homes also shot up in recent times. Of course, despite such promising developments, the labor market hasn’t been out of the woods. But, with both the manufacturing and service side of the economy showing signs of progress so far this year, there will be an uptick in hiring and people will return to work and drive wages.

Story continues

Needless to say, hiring is expected to pick up on expanded coronavirus vaccine rollout, receding winter and more federal aid. Talking about aids, the House of Representatives has approved the Biden administration’s $1.9-trillion coronavirus stimulus package, something that was certainly the need of the hour.

7,2021-03-01T11:25:11+00:00,February Ends in Green Amid Extreme Volatility: 5 Top Picks,"After a gap of three months, Wall Street faced severe volatility in February. Soaring yields on long-term U.S. Treasury Notes as investors reallocated funds from safe-haven government bonds to risky equities and market participants' expectation of an inflationary situation much faster than the Fed projected, triggered the panic button in stock markets in the second half of last month.

However, Wall Street maintained its northbound journey in February. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — gained 3.2%, 2.6% and 0.9%, respectively. Moreover, the small-cap specific Russell 2000 Index surged 6.2%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 are up 1.1%, 1.5%, 2.4% and 11.5%, respectively.

Meanwhile, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain stable. Despite the weaknesses in the labor market, personal income and expenditure have improved and savings are still sky-high. Nationwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and the reduction of new coronavirus cases to a great extent should enable the U.S. economy to systematically operate at the pre-pandemic level. Let's consider some near-term positives.

Catalysts to Drive Wall Street

First, in December 2020, the U.S. Congress has approved $900 billion of the second round of fiscal stimulus that included one-time cash payments of $600 and a special weekly unemployment benefit of $300. The immediate effect of this relief package was felt in January.

Personal income climbed 10%, marking the second-highest monthly increase on record. Personal expenditure rose 2.4%, the first gain in three months and the biggest monthly increase since June 2020. Additionally, the savings rate jumped 20.5% in January from 13.4% in the previous month.

Second, on Feb 27, the House of Representatives passed President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion fresh coronavirus-aid package. Per the bill, eligible U.S. citizens will receive a $1,400 check payment plus $1,400 for any dependent. Moreover, the extra amount in unemployment benefits would be increased to $400 a week and the period will be extended up to Aug 29. If Senate passes this bill, it is likely to significantly boost the pent-up demand for U.S. consumers.

Story continues

Third, in January, the core (excluding volatile food and energy items) PCE index — Fed's favorite gauge of inflation — rose 1.5%, year over year, which is well below the central bank's 2% target rate. This supports Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's repeated confirmation of pursuing ultra-dovish monetary policies for a longer period.

Fourth, on Feb 1, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the economy is expected to reach the pre-pandemic level of February 2020 by mid-2021. Goldman Sachs reported that total savings of U.S. citizens could climb to $2.4 trillion by mid-2021. Reopening of the economy with massive savings is likely to boost personal spending, which in turn should raise the aggregate demand.

Fifth, in its latest prediction on Feb 26, the Atlanta Fed estimated that the U.S. GDP will jump 8.8% in the first quarter of 2021. On Feb 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that economists on average expected U.S. GDP to expand nearly 4.9% this year from 4.3% in January.

Moreover, our latest projection for total earnings of the S&P 500 companies is likely to soar 28.1% year over year on 8.9% higher revenues in 2021 compared with an estimated 16.7% decline in earnings in 2020 on 0.6% lower revenues.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed down our search to five corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that suffered a blow in last month's turmoil. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2021 and witnessed solid earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.

Moreover, all these stocks have strong long-term (3-5) growth prospects. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

Apple Inc. AAPL has an expected earnings growth rate of 36.3% for the current year (ending September 2021). The company has a long-term growth rate of 11.5% compared with 9.6% of the S&P 500 Index.

8,2021-02-27T22:30:55+00:00,5 Reasons Bitcoin Is Superior to Gold,"I expect to ruffle some feathers with today’s MoneyWire, but I feel very strongly that you need to know this information. Gold vs. Bitcoin: Old-school and New-school Alternatives to Fiat Money

Source: Shutterstock

It really hit me during a recent online get together with my subscribers. I asked them whether they owned gold or not.

Holy smokes … I couldn’t keep up with the responses.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I’m not going to tell you to run out and sell your gold, but I do think it is not the holding it once was. It’s time to question whether to own it.

For my money, there’s a newer and better alternative investment. It has the same characteristics but a lot more upside potential …

Stocks slipped about 2% this past week — most of which came on Thursday. The Dow fell 559 points that day and the headlines screamed. The issue was increasing bond yields, which can signal higher interest rates and inflationary pressures.

For as long as anyone can remember, the go-to investment in times of rising rates and inflation has been gold.

Well, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) ETF was down Thursday and Friday, so that didn’t help. And over the past five years, it’s gained just 37%. That’s about a third of the S&P 500’s 96% gain in that same time.

I’ve been telling anyone who will listen about the enormous gains that are possible by owning cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, yes, but especially smaller coins known as altcoins, which have even bigger potential.

Some gold is probably fine for your portfolio, but it is no longer the best hedge against inflation.

That title now belongs to cryptocurrencies.

Like gold, silver, and commodities, bitcoin and some altcoins serve as a store of value during turbulent conditions. In fact, they can be an even better store of value.

In bitcoin’s case, total supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins (and 88% of those have already been “mined”). Cryptos are basically next-generation software, so bitcoin is not a corporation or a government that bends to doing what’s easy or convenient in a given moment. Bitcoin has no president or CEO … no board of directors that can intervene and rain down cash bailouts on the over-spenders.

Story continues

But that’s just a quick glance at why I believe bitcoin is superior to gold right now. Here’s a look at my five strongest reasons …

Supply: Both gold and bitcoin have limited supply, but the argument is more bullish for bitcoin over the long term.

Authenticity: Bitcoin and altcoins can be verified on the blockchain in a matter of seconds. Verifying gold takes much longer and is more expensive.

Transferability: Bitcoin is a digital asset, so it can be sent via the internet to anyone around the world with a connected device. Gold can also be transferred, but delivering a physical bar of gold is not easy (did I mention they’re heavy?) and definitely not safe.

Liquidity: Bitcoin is sold on any number of large, billion-dollar exchanges in a matter of seconds. Gold is not so easily converted into cash, making it a lot less liquid than bitcoin.

Legal Tender: Bitcoin is only 12 years old, but it is already a payment option at many places … with more joining the list each day. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently announced its hope to accept bitcoin as payment for vehicles. Gold, on the other hand, is rarely used to buy goods and services. Can you imagine walking into the mall with a bar of gold in your pocket?

Bottom line: Bitcoin is the new digital gold.

In addition to many of the same hedge benefits as gold, cryptos also give you massive upside potential … especially altcoins.

Quite simply, people are waking up to the fact that cryptocurrencies are one of the most valuable, most revolutionary technologies ever created.

Cryptos and the blockchain technology they are built on are going to change everything. The way you buy everyday goods and services… purchase a home… pay your taxes … even how you order a pizza.

This transformation is already underway, but the truly seismic shift — when the massive profits are made — is coming as businesses, consumers, and those big-money investors realize what’s going on.

As they do, there will be an enormous rush into this asset class. In fact, we’re already seeing it.

In just the last month, bitcoin topped a market value of $1 trillion. Only four U.S. stocks are valued higher, and they are the big boys — Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Investment banks are also stampeding into bitcoin, including the biggest of all. Blackrock is the world’s largest asset management firm with nearly $8.7 trillion under management. The firm’s chief investment officer of global fixed income recently said it has “started to dabble in bitcoin.” That may not sound like much, but don’t underestimate its significance and the credibility it lends to cryptos.

In addition, one of the best-known crypto exchanges is preparing to go public and generating all kinds of buzz. Coinbase could start trading on the Nasdaq as early March. Based on recent shares in Nasdaq Private Markets, it was valued around $100 billion. If that’s the value when shares start trading, it would be the most valuable company to go public since Facebook in 2012.

And then there’s North America’s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Canada, which got off to a blazing start. Purpose Investments’ bitcoin ETF now has nearly $700 million in assets under management after launching a little over one week ago.

This big money realizes that if they don’t adopt a plan today, they will be left behind. The same is true for investors.

But this great crypto awakening is still in its early stages. That means there’s still time to get in for the big money … if you act soon.

The question for Apple stock holders, of course, is whether their investment reached critical mass, or whether AAPL shares can continue growing in 2021.

These seven factors will have the most say in that.

#1: The Biggest Factor for Apple Stock: The iPhone 12

The big question for 2021 is whether the so-called iPhone 12 upgrade supercycle will continue to materialize.

The iPhone 12 series is the first Apple smartphone to include 5G connectivity. It was offered in the largest array of sizes and colors yet – including the first-ever iPhone mini 12 (starting at $699) and the largest-ever model in the iPhone 12 Pro Max (starting at $1,099).

Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Investing Weekly e-letter for stock recommendations and other investing advice.

Numerous analysts anticipated that this 5G capability would lead to a flood of iPhone 12 upgrades. That would be a massive coup for AAPL given that, despite softness in the global smartphone market, iPhone still accounts for the lion's share of Apple revenue. In Q4, that was $26.4 billion, or nearly 41% of Apple's total sales.

At the end of November, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives rated Apple stock at Outperform and set a 12-month price target of $150, noting:

""With our estimation that 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, we believe this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for Apple with a major holiday season on the horizon.""

Story continues

So far, so good.

Initial industry data was encouraging. In the first 24 hours of pre-orders, the iPhone 12 significantly outsold last year's iPhone 11, by a margin of 2 million units to 800,000 units.

SEE MORE 12 Hot Upcoming IPOs to Watch For in 2021

Then it was reported that Apple had upped its iPhone production order for the first half of 2021 by 30% because of a surge in demand for the iPhone 12. That report claims Apple told its suppliers it expects to sell 20% more iPhones in 2021 than in 2020.

And then, in late January, Apple dropped its fiscal Q1 earnings.

""To this point Cook & Co. reported total revenues of $111.44 billion (up 21% y/y), handily beating the Street's $103.27 billion estimate with the all-important iPhone revenue driving the beat coming in at $65.60 billion growing 17% y/y vs. the Street's estimate of $59.86 billion in a 'jaw dropper' that beat even bullish whisper expectations."" So said Ives, who maintained an Outperform (Buy) rating and $175 price target on Apple stock.

""We essentially view this quarter as the kickstart to the 5G supercycle which so far, we are seeing order activity continue to track significantly ahead of expectations as well as its predecessor iPhone 11 signaling a green light into FY21,"" he added.

More recently, Ives reported that ""our Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021,"" leading him to predict Apple would hit $3 trillion in market cap by year's end.

#2: More AirPods

AirPods – Apple's popular take on true wireless earbuds – have been a surprise hit for the company. Originally mocked for their prominent ""stems,"" AirPods have become the top seller in the wireless headphone market. In 2019, Apple sold nearly 60 million pairs. Wedbush predicted Apple sold 90 million in 2020, and believes it will sell 115 million in 2021.

The company has been moving aggressively to expand the AirPods lineup. AirPods and AirPods Pro recently were joined by the $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones. Second-generation AirPods Pro, and third-generation AirPods that resemble AirPods Pro (but lack active noise cancellation), are expected in 2021.

AirPods have turned into big business. Estimates peg Apple's AirPods revenue at greater than the total revenue generated by other tech giants such as Spotify (SPOT) and Nvidia (NVDA).

SEE MORE The 21 Best Stocks to Buy for 2021

And momentum is on Apple's side. ""Wearables increased 30%, benefiting from the launch of the Apple Watch Series 6 and greater adoption for AirPods,"" wrote CFRA's Angelo Zino (Buy) following the firm's fiscal Q1 earnings.

If AAPL can keep growing sales – and the decision to not include free wired earbuds with the iPhone 12 will help there – this line of business could produce real upside for Apple stock in 2021.

#3: M1 Macs

Apple's biggest move in 2020 was centered around its oldest product line: Mac computers. On Nov. 10, the company unveiled the first new Macs running its own ARM-based M1 chips instead of Intel (INTC) processors.

The M1 chip builds on the design Apple has employed to such great effect with the iPhone and iPad. The M1 is customized to take full advantage of macOS and Apple hardware. It can run iOS mobile apps natively, and most existing Mac software that hasn't been updated runs at full speed using Apple's Rosetta 2 emulation. In benchmark testing, the new M1-powered Macs are leaving current Windows PCs – equipped with both the latest Intel processors and graphics cards from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) – in the dust.

Despite the power on tap, the new M1 MacBook Pro is also delivering up to 20 hours of battery life.

What really has PC makers (and other chipmakers) worried is that that the M1 chip is a first-generation effort, and these new Macs are entry-level models. This year, Apple is expected to release more new Macs, equipped with more powerful M-series processors.

The Mac is fourth among Apple's five divisions by revenue, bringing in $8.7 billion in the last quarter, versus about $65.6 billion from iPhones. But it's still a meaningful number to AAPL.

The speedy M1 processor has the potential to win over Windows converts to the Mac camp. If nothing else, the powerful new Macs are certain to result in a flood of upgrades by existing Mac owners.

#4: Regulatory Challenges

The biggest challenge facing Apple in 2021 isn't a competitor; it's government agencies investigating Apple for anticompetitive behavior.

SEE MORE 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 11 He's Selling)

Apple faces a growing series of investigations in the U.S. and Europe, including:

Complaints that the latest version of iOS (which includes advanced ad-blocking and privacy controls) is anticompetitive. The company's refusal to let services other than Apple Pay use ""tap and pay"" functionality on iPhones. The forcing of apps like Spotify to pay a cut of subscription fees.

And the company still is settling expensive lawsuits over the throttling of older iPhones.

Of the legal actions AAPL is going up against in 2021, those centered on the App Store are the most worrisome for Apple stock holders. The company faces antitrust investigations in Europe and lawsuits in the U.S. And most recently, The Information, citing two people that have met regularly with the U.S. Department of Justice, reported that it's facing scrutiny from the DoJ over rules concerning its ""Sign in with Apple"" button.

Besides the legal costs and any financial penalties, Apple's 30% stake in App Store sales is at risk – and in 2020, the App Store generated around $64 billion in revenues, CNBC estimates. (Apple does not explicitly break out App Store revenue.)

#5: Pushing Services

Services has been a big part of Apple's strategy for replacing slowing iPhone revenue. That worked well with Apple Music, which quickly became second only to Spotify.

However, the latest round of Services is facing a tougher slog in terms of convincing people to pay for subscriptions. Apple TV+ has been underwhelming, and the company started giving away a free one-year subscription with device purchases. Apple News+ has struggled since launch. High-profile participants including the NewYork Times pulled out and at the end of November after Apple extended the one-month free trial to three months.

Apple Services revenue in the last quarter was $15.8 billion. That's up 24% year-over-year and makes it Apple's second-largest division in terms of revenue. But with its massive installed user base of 1.65 billion devices in active use, the company could be doing better. This year, the newly announced Apple Fitness+ and Apple One subscription bundle will try to do just that.

Needham analyst Laura Martin, who has a Buy rating on Apple stock, points out the advantages, and importance, of the Services division:

SEE MORE 15 Best ESG Funds for Responsible Investors

""Services make iOS stickier, which lowers churn,"" she says. ""Services add rev per user, which increases lifetime value (LTV) per customer; Services super-charge AAPL's profit growth.""

Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth (Strong Buy) says Services revenues could exceed $60 billion in 2021, and it's on pace to do so. He also believes that if Apple can successfully leverage that huge installed user base, that $60 billion could easily double over the next few years.

#6: The iPhone 13

Of course, Apple will have another huge product launch in 2021 in the form of the iPhone 13, which is expected to arrive this fall.

After the 5G, all-OLED display, and new form factor offered in the iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 will have its work cut out to generate the same level of upgrades the iPhone 12 is seeing.

Perhaps a folding iPhone?

For now, iPhone 13 details are almost entirely speculation. With the phone's release several months down the road, Apple stock investors shouldn't pay much attention here until more concrete news develops.

#7: Dark-Horse Products

We know that Apple is working on various projects such as some sort of autonomous car or electric car technology, Bluetooth trackers (AirTags), and satellites that could bypass wireless carriers to beam data directly iPhones.

The potential game-changer for Apple stock that could be ready for primetime in 2021 is augmented-reality (AR) glasses. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google tried and failed to crack the consumer AR market with its Google Glass. Apple watched that debacle, all the while moving the pieces for its own effort including snapping up AR-related companies and perfecting its ARKit development tools. The latest move was the inclusion of a LiDAR scanner on the iPhone 12 Pro, capable of scanning a room or objects for detailed depth information

What is being referred to as Apple Glass could land as early as this year, although many analysts are betting on 2022 or 2023. If Apple Glass does make a surprise debut next year, it could be the next big ticket, must-have Apple Device.

The global AR market is projected to be worth more than $65 billion by 2027, according to Fortune Business Insights. That's without a significant consumer presence for the technology. Apple Glass could cause that market to explode.

Whatever happens, 2021 is destined to be a big one for Apple.

It’s in the right sector and it serves a wide addressable market. It is not industry-specific, meaning they could expand into where ever demand takes them. The only requisite is that they continue executing well to grow. AI stock should have better days ahead, and is worth some risk. 3d rendering ai robot think or compute AI stocks

Before we go all in on a speculative stock like this, we should set the stage. It was a bloodbath on Wall Street Thursday so it’s not ideal to take risky bets. AI is still in its early stages, therefore still needs to prove itself. If great companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) are falling off cliffs, I should be leery of spec bets.

I don’t mean to insult the company by labeling it as such. It’s a stage that most new stocks have to go through. Investors usually require proof or time to develop courage. Unfortunately, often they get too enthusiastic, like taking AI stock to $184 per share. That was a 3.5 time increase from its IPO price in 10 days. Easy come, easy go, as they say, so those who chased late have suffered heavy losses.

AI Stock Is Down But Not Out AI c3 (AI) Stock Chart Showing Potential Bounce Path

Source: Charts by TradingView

AI stock has fallen more than 30% since earlier this month. The temptation is to want to call a bottom but we shouldn’t. The proper frame for a new investor now would be to first admit it’s a bet. Bets are fine as long as we acknowledge they carry higher levels of risk. If the assumption is that it’s near a bottom, then we take a small bite. It is important that investors set the maximum size of the risk in advance. It’s even more important to stick to it.

For example, if I decide that I am comfortable risking $1,000 (random value for illustrative purposes), I should not add to that later. This is to say that I do not average down in a young stock. AI is not a child company and it has great pedigree. Tom Siebel founded it more than a decade ago. We know what he can do from his days at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Siebel Systems. Odds are that he will do well with AI, too.

The bottom line is simple. AI stock is too young to buy with high conviction. But it is in the right industry and has great leadership so it is worth a risk.

Humans can manage the systems but they will need to use AI to do it efficiently. Speed is of the essence and our brains cannot compete with computers. So not only is AI industry-agnostic, but within companies there will be demand from almost every department. From maintenance to risk management and to client relationship. Companies will need the help of computer decision making on the fly.

Eventually it comes to valuation, and this is where it gets tricky. So far we’ve made the slam-dunk argument for the market viability. We’ve also established that this team is up to the task. Next comes the question of worth. The experts on Wall Street have split opinions about it. Their price targets range from $84 to $200 and the average is $140 per share. Their ratings are also as bifurcated. Therefore, I would ignore all of their opinions and form my own. AI Stock Chart Showing Analyst Opinions

In a bullish market I like taking a little risk on such a young stock opportunity. The traditional fundamental metrics are too messy to judge now, so there will be a leap of faith.

Whatever my total risk intent is for this, I would only take one third now. This leaves room to add on dips. This is different than averaging down because I would have held back on my risk size.

It is important to not increase the risk size without new evidence from the company. The stock market as a whole is too high and on shaky fundamentals. If that corrects, it will drag AI stock with it.

But I don’t invest in the short term. I try to look out three to five years when I buy a stock. For the part of my portfolio that’s still focused on capital gains, ServiceNow stock looks like a better bet right now.

Here’s why.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Smaller Is Better

The first reason is a lesson about numbers. Small numbers can grow faster than big ones.

During 2020, for instance, Salesforce had revenues of $17.1 billion, $3.8 billion more than in 2019. During 2020 ServiceNow had $4.5 billion in revenue, just $1 billion more than the year before. Which company grew faster? It was close, but the answer is ServiceNow.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Salesforce began by using database technology within a specific niche: customer relations management. That’s why its ticker symbol, CRM, has nothing to do with the company name. Salesforce now provides database application software across a host of business categories. Its pending purchase of Slack (NASDAQ:WORK) for $27.7 billion places it in direct competition with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in cloud office applications. It’s playing in the major leagues.

ServiceNow began with a similar database technology but focused on the construction and management of digital services. It has yet to move far beyond that niche. It’s still signing alliances around office applications, like Microsoft Teams. ServiceNow will control the workflow, Teams the collaboration. These are still believed to be separate at ServiceNow.

Betting on the Jockey

There’s another reason I jumped on ServiceNow beyond the way its numbers can still grow.

For tech investments, I bet on the jockey more than the horse. That used to mean buying a founder. No longer. Tim Cook didn’t found Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Satya Nadella didn’t found Microsoft. What you’re looking for today is a proven manager with a vision and the skills needed to execute. Get the right jockey on a fast horse, and you’re bound to win most of the time.

Story continues

That’s Bill McDermott. He’s been in database applications for two decades. He jumped to ServiceNow in 2019 from SAP (NYSE:SAP), where he was the first non-German CEO. He has forgotten more than many of his rivals know. Also, he still has some tread on his tires. He doesn’t turn 60 until August.

McDermott also knows about strategic acquisitions. His first at ServiceNow was Element AI, a Canadian developer of artificial intelligence applications co-founded by Yoshua Bengio. I met Bengio at the 2019 Heidelberg Laureate symposium. Attaching artificial intelligence structures to ServiceNow’s database-driven digital applications is, in my view, brilliant.

The Risks

There is more risk in buying a company like ServiceNow than in buying a Salesforce.

I got a taste of that when ServiceNow had some of its customer passwords hacked through its “Help the Help Desk” feature. This sent the stock down 8% in less than two weeks.

But the overall story remains intact. ServiceNow is disrupting the software industry, passing IBM (NYSE:IBM) on the cloud leader board. It is leading a workflow revolution in software, which it sells as a subscription service, a payment model I love.

The Bottom Line on NOW Stock

Smaller companies like ServiceNow carry greater risk than big ones like Salesforce. They have richer valuations. In this case it’s a price-to-sales ratio of 24, even after its recent fall, against just 11 for Salesforce.

You want to balance risks and rewards across your portfolio. On the growth side of mine, I decided ServiceNow is a better choice for me than Salesforce. I think it has more upside. But you can’t go wrong with either one.

16,2021-02-26T14:18:02+00:00,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Goldman Sachs, Dow, The Travelers Companies, Microsoft and Apple","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – February 26, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, Dow Inc. DOW, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.

Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:

Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as Dow Touches a New Milestone

On Feb 24, the Dow touched a milestone of 32,000 for the first time before closing at 31,961.86. In fact, Wall Street rebounded sharply last day, after nearly a week of volatile trading. The Dow climbed 1.4% or 424.51 points erasing a loss of 110 points at an intraday low. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% after wiping out intraday loss of 0.6%. Likewise, the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1%, reversing its intraday loss of 1.3%.

Wall Street has been witnessing a spike in volatile trading this month primarily owing to soaring yields on U.S. sovereign bonds and investors' expectations of growing inflation. A section of market participants have already raised concerns regarding a bubble in the market. However, we believe that plenty of near-term catalysts are available that will drive Wall Street's northbound journey. At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.

Dow Gains Momentum in February

The Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index — regained momentum in February after closing January in negative territory. Month to date, the index has rallied 6.6% compared with the S&P 500's gain of 5.7% and the Nasdaq Composite's rise of 4%. Year to date, the blue-chip index is up 4.4% compared with 4.5% of the S&P 500 and 5.6% of the Nasdaq Composite.

At its current level of 31,961.86, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 30,775.29 and 28,172.99, respectively. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trend setter, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.

Story continues

It is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.

Near-Term Catalysts

The U.S. government has ramped up nationwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, new cases of coronavirus infections and hospitalization have declined significantly this month. The combined effect of these two factors should lead to the gradual reopening of the U.S. economy, which has been operating at a sub-optimal level since lockdowns were imposed last year.

Moreover, the Democrats are moving ahead with President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid package to make it a law. Furthermore, last week,  Goldman Sachs reported that currently U.S. citizens have nearly $1.5 trillion in excess savings that could climb to $2.4 trillion by mid-2021. Reopening of the economy with massive savings and stimulus are likely to boost personal spending, which in turn will raise demand for businesses, especially those in the cyclical sectors.

Meanwhile, the impressive rally of stock markets and positive factors mentioned above have prompted a large-section of investors to switch their funds from safe-haven government bonds to risky assets like equities, resulting in soaring yields of U.S. Treasury Notes.

Higher risk-free return is detrimental to high growth industries like technology. Most of the growth companies depend on easy borrowing at cheap rates. A higher market interest rate will raise their cost of projects. As a result, market participants have started to reallocate their funds to cyclical stocks from growth stocks.

Notably, unlike the market's benchmark S&P 500 or the teach-heavy Nasdaq Composite, the composition of the Dow is mostly inclined toward cyclical stocks. Reopening of the economy along with high bond yields is likely to benefit the blue-chip index the most.

19,2021-02-26T13:54:01+00:00,5 ROE Picks to Buy as High Bond Yields Imply Economic Rebound,"The U.S. equity market has been trading near all-time highs in the past couple of days buoyed by relatively healthy economic recovery on better-than-expected jobless claims and uptick in household spending. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has further pledged to remain accommodative with its near zero interest rates and monthly bond purchases until the desired unemployment and inflation targets are achieved. However, surging bond yields have suddenly made stock market valuations appear less attractive, leading to broader equity market decline. Notably, the 10-year Treasury yield has hit a high of 1.6%.

As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return.

ROE: A Key Metric

ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity

ROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.

Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Parameters Used for Screening

In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.

Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.

Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.

5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:

CDW Corporation CDW: Headquartered in Vernon Hills, IL, CDW Corporation is a leading provider of integrated information technology solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

""As we look to the near-term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs, and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years, or an average of 150 each year,"" pointed out Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on an earnings conference call Thursday.

Continued Barry, ""As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large format locations each of the past two years, and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility.

Best Buy ended 2020 with 1,159 stores in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. That's down from a peak of 1,779 in 2014.

Best Buy's looming store closures likely reflects the changes the pandemic has caused to shopper behavior. Consumers are not only shopping more online for the convenience, but also opting to pick up orders in Best Buy parking lots. All of that means less of a need to operate a large format Best Buy store that may be underperforming given the costs to operate said store.

""In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has forced us to look at how we get our work done,"" Barry explained.

Best Buy's decision on stores comes after a mixed holiday quarter.

Net sales of $16.94 billion came in short of analyst estimates for $17.23 billion. Domestic same-store sales rose 12.4%, missing analyst projections for a 14.9% increase. Domestic online sales surged 89.3%, showing a further slowdown from the third and second quarters. Adjusted earnings of $3.48 a share beat estimates by 3 cents.

Story continues

For the full year, Best Buy forecast a continued sales slowdown as people get vaccinated and return to taking trips and dining out. Best Buy sees 2021 enterprise same-store sales to decline 2% to increase 1%.

Best Buy shares fell 9.2% on the news.

""In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has forced us to look at how we get our work done,"" Barry explained.

Net sales of $16.94 billion came in short of analyst estimates for $17.23 billion. Domestic same-store sales rose 12.4%, missing analyst projections for a 14.9% increase. Domestic online sales surged 89.3%, showing a further slowdown from the third and second quarters. Adjusted earnings of $3.48 a share beat estimates by 3 cents.

Video Transcript

- What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world. And the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called Figs, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the health care sector is and the workers there on the frontline each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth, who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

- Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh, my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure. And Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman, was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group. Certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing hopefully some business acumen, and then the tech side. But it just allows us a lot of flexibility. We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that, and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

Story continues

- Right. So I can see that it's not private equity per se or venture, anything like that. Permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life. And there was a moment-- I don't think he'd might be sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about it. And he stopped me and he goes, I got to be honest.

For years, Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here? And I kind of laughed, and he said, no, I'm dead serious. We always ask-- we don't want to be in the clever pile-- what can we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations. And he's incredibly sharp.

The Chinese tech giant could roll out some models this year, Reuters said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Huawei is in talks with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. and other carmakers to use their plants to manufacture the EVs, according to the report.

A Huawei spokesman denied the company plans to design EVs or produce its own branded vehicles, Reuters said. Huawei isn’t a car manufacturer and instead aims to provide components for manufacturers, a representative for the company told Bloomberg News, reiterating comments provided to Reuters.

Briefly the world’s biggest smartphone maker, Huawei has struggled to keep growing its consumer electronics business after Trump-era sanctions cut off the supply of vital semiconductors and other components. Its billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei has vowed to keep making smartphones, even after the company sold its budget Honor brand at the end of last year.

The telecom giant is also in discussions with BAIC Group’s BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co. on manufacturing the vehicles, Reuters said. Huawei has previously developed technologies for EVs including in-car software systems, sensors and 5G communications hardware, and has partnerships with automakers like General Motors Co. and SAIC Motor Corp.

BAIC BluePark jumped 8% in Shanghai trading on Friday. Shares of Changan Automobile gained more than 5% in Shenzhen. Changan Automobile told Bloomberg News it wasn’t aware of the plans. BAIC Group didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Huawei and BAIC have already been jointly developing models. BAIC’s Arcfox EV brand debuted the Arcfox HBT, a vehicle equipped with Huawei’s smart-car technology and delivery is expected in 2021.

Story continues

China’s technology companies are among some of the newest entrants into the increasingly crowded electric vehicle market. Search leader Baidu Inc. announced in January it’s teaming up with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to produce smart EVs. Xiaomi Corp., Huawei’s fiercest domestic rival in consumer electronics, said in a statement Sunday that it’s watching developments in the industry, though it hasn’t initiated any formal projects.

Apple Inc.’s foray into automobile manufacturing is the most closely watched, with speculation over its potential partners for the venture reaching a frenzy in recent weeks. Still, it may be at least half a decade before the world’s most valuable company launches its first self-driving electric car, Bloomberg News has reported.

What Happened: Apple and Kia have not completely canceled talks on electric vehicles following a deal signed by the two companies last year to pursue cooperation in eight sectors, including electric vehicles, according to South Korean online news site Chosun Biz.

Kia shares are trading 3.1% higher at press time in Seoul.

Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Apple plans to invest .6 billion in Kia Motors as part of a collaboration on electric vehicles, but Kia and Hyundai confirmed a few days later that the tech giant was no longer in talks with them.

Why It Matters: Amid intense speculation over Apple’s potential partners on the self-driving electric vehicle, reports last month indicated the iPhone maker was in negotiations with Hyundai on a deal regarding electric vehicles. While the South Korean automaker initially confirmed the reports, it later said it was in talks with several automakers.

Price Movement: Apple shares closed 3.5% lower on Thursday at $120.99 and further declined 0.2% in the after-hours session. Hyundai OTC shares closed 1.2% lower at $48.15.

28,2021-02-26T01:49:49+00:00,Kia shares rise after report says still scope for Apple partnership,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Kia Corp rose as much as 8.1% on Friday after a South Korean online news site said there was still potential for the automaker to form a partnership with Apple Inc.

Shares in Hyundai Motor Co and its affiliate Kia were roiled earlier this year after Hyundai initially confirmed early stage talks with the tech-giant on autonomous electric cars, but later said they were no longer in talks.

Online site Chosun Biz said on Friday that Apple and Kia had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) last year and had agreed to pursue cooperation in eight sectors, including electric vehicles. It said negotiations on electric vehicles had not been completely cancelled.

""Even if the negotiations on electric vehicles fail, there are many items that can be negotiated in other fields, so we are still optimistic about the possibility of partnership between the two sides,"" Chosun cited an unnamed source familiar with negotiations between Hyundai and Apple as saying.

Aside from electric vehicles, Kia and Apple are also discussing cooperation in ""last mile"" mobility, or transport to complete a final short distance to a destination after using another means of transportation, Chosun said.

A Hyundai Motor Group spokesperson and Apple had no immediate comment.

Analysts said the wording of Hyundai's statement earlier this month, that it was not in discussions with Apple about developing ""autonomous vehicles"", had left open possibilities of cooperation in other fields.

""The media report on Kia-Apple cooperation does not negate Hyundai's statement earlier this month, since the statement was limited to a certain item,"" said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities.

""The 'last mile' mobility mentioned in the article is similar to Kia's plan to strengthen its purpose-built vehicle business, which Kia said during its investor day event earlier this month,"" he added.

The rise in Kia shares was in sharp contrast to the wider market's 2.6% drop as of 0221 GMT. Kia was among only about 90 gainers, versus nearly 800 losers, on the KOSPI.

29,2021-02-25T23:30:11+00:00,3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip as the Nasdaq Sinks,"The Nasdaq tumbled 3.5% during regular trading on the second to last trading day of February, with the S&P 500 down 2.5%. Thursday’s rout spread far and wide and investors continued to sell high-flyers such as Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA, while also dropping the global titans like Apple AAPL to Microsoft MSFT.

The recent downturn, which has pushed the tech-heavy index roughly 7.5% below its February 12 records, coincides with an ultra-fast climb in U.S. Treasury yields. For instance, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has surged from 0.90% at the start of 2021 to over 1.50% on Thursday, which has pushed them back up to where they were early last year.

Wall Street is currently ramping on its bet on more government spending and a major economic rebound, driven by a successful vaccine rollout, which conjures up inflation talk. The rising yields also highlight the somewhat stretched valuations of tech stocks.

Nonetheless, the pullback from all-time highs just a few weeks ago comes as fourth quarter financial results continue to come in far stronger than projected.

More importantly, the earnings outlook for 2021 continues to improve and the Fed has once again committed to keeping its interest rates low and maintaining its easy-money policies. And with many of the biggest names in tech still boasting impressive fundamentals, the downturn might be nothing more than profiting pulling from stocks that have skyrocketed since last March.

Let’s also remember that pullbacks and corrections are healthy aspects of all markets. Stocks could clearly keep falling, but calling the bottom and the top of markets is nearly impossible. Therefore, investors with a longer-term outlook might want to consider buying some names they like on the dip.

With this in mind, here are three cheap tech stocks trading for under $20 a share that investors might want to consider buying amid the market pullback…

Infosys Limited INFY

Prior Close: $17.39 USD (close of regular trading on Feb. 25)

Story continues

Infosys is an India-based leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. The company helps its clients, which include the likes of Vanguard and Daimler, undergo digital transformations. INFY has boosted its cloud services and it has expanded its relationship with Snowflake SNOW and other tech firms that help it gain exposure. The company topped our Q3 earnings and revenue estimates in mid-January, and some of its newer initiatives helped it drive record large deals of $7.7 billion.

Infosys has grown its annual revenue at a high-single-digit clip for five straight years. Zacks estimates now call for its fourth quarter revenue to jump 11%, with its fiscal year sales projected to climb 6% to reach $13.55 billion. INFY’s revenue is then expected to climb 12% higher next year to come in at $15.22 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb 13% and 11%, respectively during this stretch.

INFY has a solid history of quarterly earnings beats and its overall earnings outlook has improved since its Q3 report. Infosys, which is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, is up 37% in the past six months to more than double its Computer Software Services Market. This outperformance trend extends over the last three years, with the stock up 100% vs. its industry’s 60%.

A recent pullback has put INFY about 9% off its January records and pushed it to 47 in terms of RSI. This moved it underneath so-called neutral levels of 50, after it climbed above 70, or the overbought threshold on the Relative Strength Index, in January.

Infosys grabs a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and it trades at a discount compared to its industry at 26X forward 12-month earnings vs. 38X. Plus, five out of the 10 broker recommendations Zacks has for the stock are at “Strong Buys.” The digital services and consulting company also operates in a growth space, as businesses of all types must adapt to our data-heavy digital world.

Himax Technologies, Inc. HIMX

Prior Close: $13.16 USD (close of regular trading on Feb. 25)

Himax is a fabless semiconductor firm focused on display imaging processing technologies. The company’s solutions are used in everything from TVs, laptops, and smartphones to navigation systems, virtual reality devices, and more.

HIMX had a bounce back year in 2020, after its sales dipped in FY19. More importantly, its growth kicked into high gear in the second half, with Q3 revenue up 46%. It fourth quarter sales, which it reported on February 4, then surged 58%. In fact, both its sales and gross margin hit record highs in the fourth quarter.

HIMX’s adjusted Q4 earnings also climbed from $0.01 a year ago to $0.20 a share. Overall, its FY20 revenue surged 32% and it has seen strong momentum across all of its core segments.

Executives are also confident about its ability to thrive amid the current chip shortage. “The overall semiconductor industry supply will not have any significant increase any time soon, while strong demand is likely to persist longer than expected. In such an environment, Himax is a preferred supplier to work with for our sizable scale, diversified vendor pool and extensive product offerings,” CEO Jordan Wu said in prepared remarks.

Himax’s earnings outlook has surged recently to help it grab a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Looking ahead, Zacks estimates call for its FY21 revenue to climb another 38% to hit $1.22 billion, with FY22 projected to jump 8% higher. Back-to-back years of 30% growth is certainly impressive and both mark HIMX’s strongest revenue growth since going public. Meanwhile, its adjusted fiscal 2021 earnings are projected to skyrocket 283%.

Investors had cheered its second-half of 2020 performance, by pushing HIMX stock up 240% in the past six months and around 80% in 2021. This recent run helped Himax surpass its previous records of roughly $14 a share that it hit back in 2017.

But the recent tech selloff, including Thursday’s big drop, has the stock trading 25% below its mid-February records of over $17 a share. The pullback has also taken HIMX down from its recently-overbought RSI levels of 85 back to nearly neutral at 54.

Alongside its cheap price tag, HIMX trades at a huge discount to its highly-ranked industry at 2X forward 12-month sales vs. 8.6X. Himax also sports “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. And it provides exposure to the broader display space that plays an integral role in our device-heavy world.

Infinera Corporation INFN

Prior Close: $9.42 USD (close of regular trading on Feb. 25)

Infinera is a networking solutions company that helps cloud operators, enterprises, carriers, and other entities “scale network bandwidth, accelerate service innovation, and automate network operations.” The company boasts that its end-to-end packet-optical portfolio delivers “industry-leading economics and performance” in long-haul, submarine, data center interconnect, and metro transport applications.

INFN topped our Q4 estimates on February 23 and it grabs a “B” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system. INFN’s 2020 revenue jumped 5% and Zacks estimates call for its FY21 sales to climb another 6% to $1.44 billion.

The company’s fiscal 2022 sales are then projected to climb 12% higher to reach $1.61 billion. This top-line expansion is expected to help the company swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.19 a share last year all the way to +$0.13 this year. Better still, Infinera’s FY22 earnings are projected to soar 235% to $0.43 a share.

Infinera shares have surged 75% in the last two years to match the Zacks Tech sector. The stock has also popped 30% during the trailing six months to easily beat the Computer-Networking market’s 10% average climb.

INFN stock has seen investors take profits after it hit 52-week highs in December. Infinera now trades 15% below its recent highs and has tumbled down to 40 in terms of RSI (from over 70 in Dec.), which has it approaching the oversold threshold of 30.

Despite its recent strength, the stock has continued to trade at a solid discount compared to its industry in terms of forward 12-month sales, at 1.2X vs. 3.6X—this represents even better value against the broader Zacks Tech sector’s 4.9X. Infinera lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment and it has blown away our EPS estimates in the last three quarters. Investors should also know that the stock traded for over $20 a share back in 2015.

The power of Big Tech to tamp down potential business rivals stretches all the way into the courtroom, a leading antitrust attorney testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust on Thursday.

John Thorne, a partner with the law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, testified that the Justice Department (DOJ) and state attorneys general lack the resources necessary to effectively enforce their antitrust laws and their cases now pending against Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

“The cases right now against Google are the hardest cases ever litigated in our courts,” Thorne testified, describing the state and federal attorneys handling the lawsuits as great lawyers whose departments are underfunded and underpaid.

“The staff lawyers at DOJ, and the staff lawyers at the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the other states that are in that case, are paid below market, but they are working above market,” Thorne said. “They do not have the same resources that their opponent has.”

Thorne said lawyers working on behalf of the Texas Attorney General requested $43 million from the state’s legislature, solely for the purpose of hiring expert witnesses in what they described as a bidding war. “The answer from the finance chair of the Texas Senate was, “‘I don't think that's gonna be enough money for you. I don't think you can actually win this with that [budget],’” Thorne said.

""Fancy lawyer"" needed for individual antitrust case

The subcommittee’s hearing was focused on solutions to longstanding concerns that Google, as well as Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), have abused their monopoly power.

Another witness, Dr. Hal Singer, managing director for Econ One, told lawmakers that the cards are also stacked against individual players who wish to bring an antitrust case against Big Tech companies, particularly against Amazon, which requires its sellers to arbitrate legal claims individually and outside of court.

Story continues

“To bring an antitrust case against Amazon, by yourself, you'd have to hire a fancy antitrust lawyer and you'd have to hire a fancy antitrust economist, and just the scale doesn't make sense to bring these claims, individually. And so the system is rigged, effectively, to immunize Amazon from antitrust scrutiny, at least in by private complainants,” Singer said.

Antitrust cases can move faster

According to Thorne, sufficient funding for antitrust cases could ensure they don't drag out so long that they're no longer relevant to consumers. “Closely related to resources is how long it takes to get an antitrust trust case to trial,” Thorne said. “If it takes years to investigate, and then years to get the trial, that's a lot of years the public is denied competition, waiting for law enforcement. I know these cases can move faster because I've seen it done.” WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 29: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks via video conference during the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law hearing on Online Platforms and Market Power in the Rayburn House office Building, July 29, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.

Google faces three antitrust lawsuits; one filed in October by the DOJ and 11 states attorneys general; and two others filed in December by coalitions of state attorneys general.

The lawsuits accuse the company of using its monopoly power to exclude rivals from the online search and advertising markets and of improperly entering exclusionary contracts with Apple and other companies that make Google the default search engine on mobile devices; Google is also accused of denying specialized search sites like Expedia (EXPE), Angie’s List, and Yelp (YELP) of “prime real estate” on its search results page.

Facebook is also facing two antitrust lawsuits: one brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seeking to break it up, and another brought by 48 U.S. attorneys general claiming it violates antitrust law by buying up competitors. The competitive practices of Apple and Amazon remain part of ongoing investigations by federal and state officials.

Powered by consumers continuing to invest in work-from-home tech gear during the COVID-19 pandemic, HP blew away Wall Street sales and profit forecasts Thursday after the close. The company also shared upbeat guidance for its fiscal year, which may trigger a good number of upward revisions to analyst profit estimates and stock price targets in the coming days.

""What we are seeing is very strong demand for our products in the PC space and in the printing space, especially at home,"" HP CEO Enrique Lores told Yahoo Finance.

Here is how HP performed in its fiscal first quarter compared to Wall Street estimates.

Total Sales: $15.6 billion vs. $14.97 billion Personal System Segment Sales: $10.6 billion vs. $10.33 billion Printing Segment Sales: $5.0 billion vs. $4.67 billion Diluted EPS: $0.92 vs. $0.66 (guidance: $0.64 to $0.70) Full Fiscal Year Earnings Guidance: $3.15 to $3.25 vs. $2.65

HP's quarter highlights how the pandemic continues to weigh on the business of work.

Sales at HP’s personal systems and printing segments each rose 7% from a year ago. Sales growth was notched inside the consumer segments (up 34% for personal systems, and up 18% for printers) of each division, reflecting consumers buying notebook computers and printers to work from home.

Meanwhile, commercial sales fell 6% inside the personal systems segment while they were unchanged in the printer business. The mixed results here reflect workers having migrated from offices where large printers and desktops reign supreme — hence less desire by businesses to buy new hardware.

Operating profit margins at the personal systems and printer segments rose 200 and 500 basis points, respectively, versus a year ago.

What investors will likely watch for next is any financial impact to PC makers like HP from the yawning chip supply shortages. HP relies on Intel and AMD for its chips. Lores says the shortages are being fueled by strong demand for computing equipment.

Story continues

""We provided very strong guidance for the second quarter and for the rest of the year. And this shows that even if there will be shortages, we are going to continue to grow. We are going to continue to be able to meet the majority of customer needs.""

But in a recent interview, Thomas Tull — a billionaire former film producer behind blockbuster movies like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World"" — said hit movies would remain after the pandemic, even if they're increasingly watched in the home rather than the movie theater.

Top filmmakers will continue to make movies seen around the world, Tull said, but he acknowledged that the prevalence of streaming services will change how the industry monetizes films since they use ""completely different metrics.""

When asked whether blockbuster movies have become a thing of the past, Tull says, ""I don't think so.""

""I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than the imagination,"" says Tull, the former CEO of film production company Legendary Entertainment, who now runs a holding company called Tulco. ""Everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.""

""I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment,"" he adds. ""It was kind of surreal.""

COVID-19 has ""accelerated what was already happening,"" further sidelining the movie theater segment of the business and hastening the rise of streaming services, Tull said.

AT&T-owned WarnerMedia (T) sent shockwaves through the movie industry in December when it announced that it would release 2021 Warner Bros. movies simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming service when they hit movie theaters. The move began with ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" a highly anticipated action movie released on Dec. 25 starring Gal Gadot; it will continue with major upcoming movies such as ""Dune"" and ""Matrix 4.""

Story continues

The WarnerMedia decision drew backlash from prominent filmmakers, including Christopher Nolan, who called the situation ""very, very, very, very messy."" Last week, director Martin Scorsese added his voice to the chorus critical of the rise of streaming, saying in an essay for Harper's Magazine that the platforms worsen the quality of film because their algorithms prize consumer appeal over taste.

Tull, who worked with Nolan on ""Batman Begins"" and other films, said top filmmakers will continue to create captivating work, no matter how it reaches audiences.

""Besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg — all these incredible storytellers,"" Tull says. ""I think at the heart of this, that it's part of our cultural fabric.""

""We're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront,"" he adds. ""It's just going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently."" Thomas Tull, the CEO of the holding company Tulco, speaks with Andy Serwer on an episode of ""Influencers with Andy Serwer.""

Tull spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.

Since 2017, Tull has led Tulco, a holding company that helps businesses in various sectors improve through the deployment of artificial intelligence and other technical advances. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of the film production company Legendary Entertainment.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance, Tull said that the rise of streaming services allows for greater flexibility in visual storytelling.

""The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is it used to be something was a two-ish hour movie, or a 13-episode series on television and some small variations,"" he says.

""Now, you can do almost anything,"" he adds. ""The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes.""

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: How does one go from running a chain of laundromats to becoming one of the top producers in Hollywood? Just ask Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Entertainment and financier behind many of the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. After a long string of big budget successes like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Jurassic World,"" Tull chose to walk away from the bright lights in search of his next venture.

Now he's got his eyes on the future, using his deep pockets and vast network to invest in areas like next-gen technology and artificial intelligence. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco, as we discuss his experience in the movie business, his ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the one piece of advice that Warren Buffett once shared about investing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Thomas Tull, who is the founder and CEO of holding company Tulco and a member of the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thomas, great to see you.

THOMAS TULL: You too, Andy. Nice to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So why don't we start off by telling us what Tulco is all about.

THOMAS TULL: Well, it's a holding company structure. And the idea was to find companies that are in spaces that are large but traditionally have not had a lot of technical innovation. And then inside the holding company, we had a group, the tech group that we call Labs, and be able to bring that group's wherewithal and skill sets into these companies to not only provide the capital but the expertise to hopefully transform the businesses to make them much more efficient.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: You've had this incredible career arc. You went from laundromats, to taxes, to Legendary Entertainment, and now this. And we're going to get in all that stuff, but what's sort of the common thread here, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Extreme luck, I guess. But, you know, part of it I think is I'm not-- I wouldn't be good at sort of inventing a new thing that never existed before. If I have any skills, I think it's to look at a company, a sector, an ecosystem, and maybe to be able to find ways to make it more efficient hopefully to have some level of pattern recognition to say, well, these are some methodologies or financial, technical, et cetera, that may work to make this more valuable, and then to do your homework and then go into the space and hopefully to come out successfully.

ANDY SERWER: Let's drill down into Tulco a little bit more. What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called FIGS, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And, obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is and the workers that are on the front line each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So, it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

ANDY SERWER: Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure, and Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman who was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group, certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing, hopefully, some business acumen and then the tech side, but it just allows us a lot of flexibility.

We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right. So I can see that it's not private equity, per se, or venture or anything like that. You have permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about a business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and there was a moment-- I don't think he'd mind me sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about, and he stopped me. And he goes, I got to be honest, for years Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

And I kind of laughed. And he said, no. I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations, and, you know, he's incredibly sharp, and it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.

ANDY SERWER: That is a great nugget. I love that, just to avoid the dumb thing is more important than finding this absolute incredibly smart thing, right?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: So getting back to your insurance operation for a minute, Thomas, I notice that Russell Wilson and his wife, Sierra, have joined in that endeavor somehow, correct?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. It's a joint venture with Acrisure on a separate company. It's part of the Acrisure universe, and they're wonderful people. I've been friends with them socially for years, and just absolute stand up people. And I think making sure that this company not only is profitable but is targeted in a way that allows folks to be included in everything that we want to do. And Russell and Sierra great ambassadors for that, and I think it's very important.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us a little bit about AI. You mentioned how important that is. This is an expertise that's core to your business, and how important do you think this is to the economy going forward?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think every corner of our economy over the next decade is going to be touched by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I think that, done well, it's the human machine interface that makes us more efficient, more thoughtful, and allows us to be not wasteful and, again, to find patterns and find ways that we can be smarter about the way that we approach things, or less dumb if you want to use Warren's axiom.

And so I think that if you're applying it in ways that make sense-- because I think there's a lot of, certainly, in talk about big data and how you use big data. That's great, but it has to be actionable. It has to be measurable, and you have to be able to point to it and say, look, we applied artificial intelligence. We applied data science, and here are the results that we got. It's not magic.

It's just, I think, at the confluence of what situations are appropriate and right to apply it. What can be automated? And then from a jobs perspective, how do we make people free up their time, and how do we do things better, and what other jobs can that open up in the economy?

ANDY SERWER: You've gone from sort of these high profile business in Legendary into sort of more of a nuts and bolts part of the economy. Do you miss the glam of Hollywood?

THOMAS TULL: I don't. Look, it was a wonderful experience. I met some amazing people. I enjoyed the storytelling aspect, and now I'm enjoying the chapter I'm in now. So, again, it was a privilege to be a part of and something that I'm proud of, but I am really enjoying what I'm doing right now.

ANDY SERWER: When you think about these businesses that you're in right now, Thomas, do you talk about or think about how they compete with what's going on with similar kinds of businesses in China, and what do you think the United States' policy should be with regard to China?

THOMAS TULL: Well, that's a very big question. I think that it's important to recognize where we can have common ground, and I think it's also important to recognize where I think we have to take a tough stance on what's fair. And I think the time has certainly come on intellectual property and on technology and practices that don't put us on equal footing to really kind of demand that we reach an accord in agreement.

And I'm hopeful that that can happen because I think it's obviously in everybody's best interest, but when you're talking about being competitive globally, I think it's naive and Pollyanna to not think about the ways in which, if you're competing with Chinese companies, they do have some distinct advantages. And so I think you have to take that into account and just recognize that that's the way it is. Like, you can try to wish it away, but that that's not going to help very much.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you were owned by-- when you were at Legendary, you were owned by a Chinese company, Wanda, in the later history of Legendary. What was that like?

THOMAS TULL: Well, after we sold the company to them, I was there for a short amount of time to sort of transition it over. And look, you know, they had plans and goals, and they also owned AMC. So there was some thought process that went into that, definitely different but, you know, they were a big-- are a big company and certainly had theme parks and theaters and things of that nature. So it was definitely a different pivot, but I was only there for a short amount of time after the transaction.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us, though, about building Legendary Entertainment because, boy, that's a pretty unusual thing because most of the studios, obviously, are decades and decades old. So to build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with that thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena, and my thought process was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, give or take. Just the film side it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size.

There were a lot of-- you know, they do German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures. And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem, use their global distribution that, after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me. Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend.

And, you know, sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out was pretty darn good. And, you know, but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But, you know, it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask you about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I was used to saying I wasn't joking. I'd just say, can we get your catering order right? Like, how do we-- you know, film is a collaborative process. And, you know, you make a movie or you're about to make a movie, and the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes. And with Chris, I'm not kidding, we would just say, thank you so much. We're very glad that we're financing your movie, and we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and it was evident very early. ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie, and he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since. I mean, you look, the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID, and maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation.

THOMAS TULL: You know, so a couple of things. I think COVID has impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. You know, one of the reasons that I thought it was the right time, at least for me, to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business, and you look at the way making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid in secondary windows and so forth, all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right-- they're based on completely different metrics than a media companies-- is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

And I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for-- oh, I guess they did, right? Because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw dropping. I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones"", or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon, they're compelling, right?

They're big cinematic experiences. Now, as someone that, as a fan, loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope, I think, is important. I loved doing that growing up, and I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen, but I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. And of course, the home entertainment gets better and better and better, and movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX and some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you know, thousands of venues, right, what that coordination, what that bill, what that looks like, it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now in what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable, and we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters a thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look. The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is used to be something was a two-ish hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television and some small variations. Now you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes, but no. I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination, and sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.

I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment. It was kind of surreal. So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers like, besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg, all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric, and we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.

ANDY SERWER: Let me switch over and ask you about football a little bit, Thomas. How would you assess the recently completed NFL season? One for the ages, no doubt.

THOMAS TULL: I think the league actually did a phenomenal job. If you stop and think about every game was played under less than ideal circumstances, and we had playoffs. We had a Super Bowl. I thought it was a powerful moment when those 7,500 front line health care workers were at the Super Bowl. I thought that was incredibly powerful. You know, the crazy thing about this period of time, and you think about what teachers are going through, you know? Certainly health care workers, normal people trying to figure out and navigate their way through this.

There's no playbook for any of this. So, you know, on one hand, you want to constantly be thinking about what is best, and you have to put the players and the fans and everybody's personal safety must be the guiding light. And at the same time, so many fans, I mean, just personally and then for the league saying, please. Don't take away-- you know, football is important, and that sort of escapism certainly nowhere near as important-- I don't want to be mistaken for saying that football is something that had to go on, but just to provide some level of entertainment and normalcy I thought was important.

And I think the league did a really nice job getting through this, certainly we'll remember it forever, and I really hope we don't have to do it again, and we can return to some level of normalcy. But, you know, I'm glad that we played. Obviously, the end didn't turn out too well for our team, but just to see the games played and see it through I thought was an accomplishment.

ANDY SERWER: Let me pick up on that one point you just made there about next season, though. What do you think the chances are of it being a normal season next fall?

THOMAS TULL: Well, depending on what normal's definition is. Do I think there will be fans? Is it going to be full? I have no idea, but do I think fans will regularly attend? I'm personally optimistic, right? Do I think that perhaps checkpoints and masks might be a part of that equation somewhere? That's not hard to envision. Do I think testing is going to be a part of it, player safety, all those things? Certainly, I do.

I'm rooting for our entire country on the vaccine front to try to get things distributed as quickly as we can, especially to people that need it the most. And, you know, hopefully we can all get back to living. And I think about everything from small business owners who, you know, are trying to make it to the other side of this, which is really the backbone of this country. And, you know, on the other hand, I think what some of the scientists have pulled off in terms of these vaccines, I really think we're going to look back in time and realize what a monumental achievement it is.

I mean, I'm not fluent in biomed, but friends that are that are into deep research who just said, you have no idea what an accomplishment it is at this speed and velocity to pull this off. And so hopefully that gets rolled out, and we can move ahead.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the Steelers, Thomas? How are they looking for next year in your quarterback situation?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. It's all complicated certainly by the fact we just found out what the cap number is going to be. You know, Ben has been-- he's somebody I'm close to, but he's also one of the greatest Steelers of all time. He's won a couple of Super Bowls, and hopefully everything can be worked out. But at the same time, I think that just this whole year just had a lot of uniqueness to it, but I'm hopeful that it can work out.

He certainly is going to go down on the Mount Rushmore of Steeler players, and so I know that they're talking-- Mr. Rooney, our principal owner, and Kevin Colbert and Coach Tomlin and, you know, they always do a good job. So we'll see what happens.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of Coach Tomlin, the NFL only has three black coaches. What's wrong here, and how do you fix that?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. I had the privilege of being close to Mr. Rooney, Mr. Dan Rooney, who the Rooney Rule is named for. I cannot express what a fine human being he was. I miss him dearly. And recently, his wife had passed away, just the classiest people you ever want to know, and it was so important to him. And I think that we have to-- it's great that we have an interview process, but I think we have to be able to do more.

And I think part of that is what sort of other support can we provide, and I know we have some amazing coaches. There are candidates I'd certainly like to see have head coach, maybe not in our division because they're incredibly talented, but I think it's something that you have to constantly weigh and measure and not just say, hey, we put a rule in place. You know, you're doing the best that you can.

Well, if it's not working, what else can we do to keep progressing forward and make sure that we're doing that? I mean, one of the most profound experiences of my life, to go back to the movie thing, but I had the absolute pleasure of-- we made the movie ""42"" about Jackie Robinson. And certainly, that experience frames a lot of my thinking. And, you know, the opportunity that we all get a real shot, right? And, you know, are weighed on the merits, but that we have justice, and we're treated the same before the law, and that we have an opportunity.

If we have the skills, then we should be able to fill those spots. And I think we have a lot of work to go because we're not there yet. So I think we just have to constantly ask ourselves, what's working, what isn't working, and what can we tweak to make sure that this is dynamic and is ever changing to rise to the challenge?

ANDY SERWER: Let me go from football to baseball. Curt Schilling asked to be removed from the ballot for the Hall of Fame. You sit on the Hall of Fame board and will make the decision on it. Should he stay on the ballot or be removed, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: You know, these are just incredibly unique times. I know that we're going to be briefed on the situation. You know, I'd love to know really what the thinking is, but look, on the other hand, if a player says, I don't want to be associated or considered with the Hall of Fame, which I think is a privilege, then I'm not sure that player should be considered.

I mean, you have to take each individual case, and I certainly want to learn more. But to me, what would be ideal is to have the Hall of Fame be sort of away from politics and away from things of that nature and just say, hey, it's here to celebrate the game of baseball and certainly the right conduct and all those other things, but you just hate to see things get twisted up is all.

ANDY SERWER: You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking about whether anyone had ever turned down an induction. People have turned down Oscars before.

THOMAS TULL: Mm-hm.

ANDY SERWER: Right? Just putting that out there. It's interesting.

THOMAS TULL: Sure.

ANDY SERWER: It's part of the thinking.

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. That's one of the things just overall that I think is great about this country and the freedom it affords is that I don't have to agree with everything that you say, and hopefully we're able in a civil way to exchange ideas and not be afraid to exchange ideas in a civil tone. And, you know, hopefully we can progress to that place.

ANDY SERWER: You grew up in a low income family raised by a single mom in upstate New York, earned an athletic scholarship to a NESCAC school-- got to get a NESCAC pitch in there-- Hamilton College.

THOMAS TULL: Yup.

ANDY SERWER: I'm a NESCAC guy, too. Launched laundromats, as I mentioned, after graduation. So how did that early life experience shape you, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think knowing what it feels like to truly-- you know, there's not another euphemism. We were poor. I mean, if you know what it's like to go to bed hungry or have the lights turned off, you know, it has an impact. And I also looked at my mother who's a dental hygienist and she worked two jobs, and I watched her do that and do whatever was necessary, and just day after day.

And that's, I think thematically for me, that there are heroes that do amazing things in the moment they're called upon. I'm also always impressed with people that answer the bell every day, right, that are doing things when no one's looking and there's no extra credit, right? It's not on Instagram. It's just, hey, I'm getting up and I'm doing what I need to do, and I think that's heroic in itself. You know, my grandmother, her mother was a hospital cleaning lady, which is one of the toughest jobs that I can think of.

And so I just think, from a young age, understanding that you better have resiliency and that, whether you like it or not, whatever the circumstances are, that's what you have to deal with. So, you know, any of that certainly comes from them and from the experiences I had. And then the other side of it, anybody who gets anywhere, I think, has to make peace with the fact that there is absolutely luck involved because things could go inch to the left, inch to the right, and your life is completely different.

And I try to really keep that in mind that if you start to think, jeez, I'm in a different place and pretty special, you better keep that thinking at bay because I think that it's not correct, and it's dangerous thinking.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, Thomas, have you thought about what you'd like your legacy to be?

THOMAS TULL: Look, I feel like every single day I get to live a life that I couldn't even imagine. So I think, hopefully, my number one thing is I've got two 11-year-old twin boys that are at the center of my world, and being a good father is a very big deal to me. And I'd also say just that, you know, doing the things that I have the reach or impact to be able to do to help because I think, in our country citizenship, is something that you have to work at it. You have an obligation to be informed.

And if you have the opportunity through philanthropically or some way to help to be impactful in your community, you have to do those things. And so I just hope that-- you have to earn that every single day. And so I think a lot about that and, you know, but I'm in a place that I'm still trying to earn that rather than thinking about what it is. So hopefully we can keep it going.

ANDY SERWER: Sounds good. Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco. Thank you so much for your time.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: How does one go from running a chain of laundromats to becoming one of the top producers in Hollywood? Just ask Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Entertainment and financier behind many of the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. After a long string of big budget successes like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Jurassic World,"" Tull chose to walk away from the bright lights in search of his next venture.

Now he's got his eyes on the future, using his deep pockets and vast network to invest in areas like next-gen technology and artificial intelligence. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco, as we discuss his experience in the movie business, his ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the one piece of advice that Warren Buffett once shared about investing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Thomas Tull, who is the founder and CEO of holding company Tulco and a member of the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thomas, great to see you.

THOMAS TULL: You too, Andy. Nice to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So why don't we start off by telling us what Tulco is all about.

THOMAS TULL: Well, it's a holding company structure. And the idea was to find companies that are in spaces that are large but traditionally have not had a lot of technical innovation. And then inside the holding company, we had a group, the tech group that we call Labs, and be able to bring that group's wherewithal and skill sets into these companies to not only provide the capital but the expertise to hopefully transform the businesses to make them much more efficient.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: You've had this incredible career arc. You went from laundromats, to taxes, to Legendary Entertainment, and now this. And we're going to get in all that stuff, but what's sort of the common thread here, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Extreme luck, I guess. But, you know, part of it I think is I'm not-- I wouldn't be good at sort of inventing a new thing that never existed before. If I have any skills, I think it's to look at a company, a sector, an ecosystem, and maybe to be able to find ways to make it more efficient hopefully to have some level of pattern recognition to say, well, these are some methodologies or financial, technical, et cetera, that may work to make this more valuable, and then to do your homework and then go into the space and hopefully to come out successfully.

ANDY SERWER: Let's drill down into Tulco a little bit more. What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called FIGS, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And, obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is and the workers that are on the front line each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So, it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

ANDY SERWER: Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure, and Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman who was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group, certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing, hopefully, some business acumen and then the tech side, but it just allows us a lot of flexibility.

We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right. So I can see that it's not private equity, per se, or venture or anything like that. You have permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about a business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and there was a moment-- I don't think he'd mind me sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about, and he stopped me. And he goes, I got to be honest, for years Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

And I kind of laughed. And he said, no. I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations, and, you know, he's incredibly sharp, and it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.

ANDY SERWER: That is a great nugget. I love that, just to avoid the dumb thing is more important than finding this absolute incredibly smart thing, right?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: So getting back to your insurance operation for a minute, Thomas, I notice that Russell Wilson and his wife, Sierra, have joined in that endeavor somehow, correct?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. It's a joint venture with Acrisure on a separate company. It's part of the Acrisure universe, and they're wonderful people. I've been friends with them socially for years, and just absolute stand up people. And I think making sure that this company not only is profitable but is targeted in a way that allows folks to be included in everything that we want to do. And Russell and Sierra great ambassadors for that, and I think it's very important.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us a little bit about AI. You mentioned how important that is. This is an expertise that's core to your business, and how important do you think this is to the economy going forward?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think every corner of our economy over the next decade is going to be touched by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I think that, done well, it's the human machine interface that makes us more efficient, more thoughtful, and allows us to be not wasteful and, again, to find patterns and find ways that we can be smarter about the way that we approach things, or less dumb if you want to use Warren's axiom.

And so I think that if you're applying it in ways that make sense-- because I think there's a lot of, certainly, in talk about big data and how you use big data. That's great, but it has to be actionable. It has to be measurable, and you have to be able to point to it and say, look, we applied artificial intelligence. We applied data science, and here are the results that we got. It's not magic.

It's just, I think, at the confluence of what situations are appropriate and right to apply it. What can be automated? And then from a jobs perspective, how do we make people free up their time, and how do we do things better, and what other jobs can that open up in the economy?

ANDY SERWER: You've gone from sort of these high profile business in Legendary into sort of more of a nuts and bolts part of the economy. Do you miss the glam of Hollywood?

THOMAS TULL: I don't. Look, it was a wonderful experience. I met some amazing people. I enjoyed the storytelling aspect, and now I'm enjoying the chapter I'm in now. So, again, it was a privilege to be a part of and something that I'm proud of, but I am really enjoying what I'm doing right now.

ANDY SERWER: When you think about these businesses that you're in right now, Thomas, do you talk about or think about how they compete with what's going on with similar kinds of businesses in China, and what do you think the United States' policy should be with regard to China?

THOMAS TULL: Well, that's a very big question. I think that it's important to recognize where we can have common ground, and I think it's also important to recognize where I think we have to take a tough stance on what's fair. And I think the time has certainly come on intellectual property and on technology and practices that don't put us on equal footing to really kind of demand that we reach an accord in agreement.

And I'm hopeful that that can happen because I think it's obviously in everybody's best interest, but when you're talking about being competitive globally, I think it's naive and Pollyanna to not think about the ways in which, if you're competing with Chinese companies, they do have some distinct advantages. And so I think you have to take that into account and just recognize that that's the way it is. Like, you can try to wish it away, but that that's not going to help very much.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you were owned by-- when you were at Legendary, you were owned by a Chinese company, Wanda, in the later history of Legendary. What was that like?

THOMAS TULL: Well, after we sold the company to them, I was there for a short amount of time to sort of transition it over. And look, you know, they had plans and goals, and they also owned AMC. So there was some thought process that went into that, definitely different but, you know, they were a big-- are a big company and certainly had theme parks and theaters and things of that nature. So it was definitely a different pivot, but I was only there for a short amount of time after the transaction.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us, though, about building Legendary Entertainment because, boy, that's a pretty unusual thing because most of the studios, obviously, are decades and decades old. So to build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with that thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena, and my thought process was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, give or take. Just the film side it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size.

There were a lot of-- you know, they do German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures. And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem, use their global distribution that, after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me. Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend.

And, you know, sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out was pretty darn good. And, you know, but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But, you know, it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask you about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I was used to saying I wasn't joking. I'd just say, can we get your catering order right? Like, how do we-- you know, film is a collaborative process. And, you know, you make a movie or you're about to make a movie, and the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes. And with Chris, I'm not kidding, we would just say, thank you so much. We're very glad that we're financing your movie, and we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and it was evident very early. ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie, and he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since. I mean, you look, the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID, and maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation.

THOMAS TULL: You know, so a couple of things. I think COVID has impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. You know, one of the reasons that I thought it was the right time, at least for me, to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business, and you look at the way making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid in secondary windows and so forth, all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right-- they're based on completely different metrics than a media companies-- is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

And I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for-- oh, I guess they did, right? Because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw dropping. I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones"", or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon, they're compelling, right?

They're big cinematic experiences. Now, as someone that, as a fan, loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope, I think, is important. I loved doing that growing up, and I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen, but I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. And of course, the home entertainment gets better and better and better, and movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX and some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you know, thousands of venues, right, what that coordination, what that bill, what that looks like, it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now in what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable, and we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters a thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look. The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is used to be something was a two-ish hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television and some small variations. Now you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes, but no. I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination, and sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.

I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment. It was kind of surreal. So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers like, besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg, all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric, and we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.

ANDY SERWER: Let me switch over and ask you about football a little bit, Thomas. How would you assess the recently completed NFL season? One for the ages, no doubt.

THOMAS TULL: I think the league actually did a phenomenal job. If you stop and think about every game was played under less than ideal circumstances, and we had playoffs. We had a Super Bowl. I thought it was a powerful moment when those 7,500 front line health care workers were at the Super Bowl. I thought that was incredibly powerful. You know, the crazy thing about this period of time, and you think about what teachers are going through, you know? Certainly health care workers, normal people trying to figure out and navigate their way through this.

There's no playbook for any of this. So, you know, on one hand, you want to constantly be thinking about what is best, and you have to put the players and the fans and everybody's personal safety must be the guiding light. And at the same time, so many fans, I mean, just personally and then for the league saying, please. Don't take away-- you know, football is important, and that sort of escapism certainly nowhere near as important-- I don't want to be mistaken for saying that football is something that had to go on, but just to provide some level of entertainment and normalcy I thought was important.

And I think the league did a really nice job getting through this, certainly we'll remember it forever, and I really hope we don't have to do it again, and we can return to some level of normalcy. But, you know, I'm glad that we played. Obviously, the end didn't turn out too well for our team, but just to see the games played and see it through I thought was an accomplishment.

ANDY SERWER: Let me pick up on that one point you just made there about next season, though. What do you think the chances are of it being a normal season next fall?

THOMAS TULL: Well, depending on what normal's definition is. Do I think there will be fans? Is it going to be full? I have no idea, but do I think fans will regularly attend? I'm personally optimistic, right? Do I think that perhaps checkpoints and masks might be a part of that equation somewhere? That's not hard to envision. Do I think testing is going to be a part of it, player safety, all those things? Certainly, I do.

I'm rooting for our entire country on the vaccine front to try to get things distributed as quickly as we can, especially to people that need it the most. And, you know, hopefully we can all get back to living. And I think about everything from small business owners who, you know, are trying to make it to the other side of this, which is really the backbone of this country. And, you know, on the other hand, I think what some of the scientists have pulled off in terms of these vaccines, I really think we're going to look back in time and realize what a monumental achievement it is.

I mean, I'm not fluent in biomed, but friends that are that are into deep research who just said, you have no idea what an accomplishment it is at this speed and velocity to pull this off. And so hopefully that gets rolled out, and we can move ahead.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the Steelers, Thomas? How are they looking for next year in your quarterback situation?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. It's all complicated certainly by the fact we just found out what the cap number is going to be. You know, Ben has been-- he's somebody I'm close to, but he's also one of the greatest Steelers of all time. He's won a couple of Super Bowls, and hopefully everything can be worked out. But at the same time, I think that just this whole year just had a lot of uniqueness to it, but I'm hopeful that it can work out.

He certainly is going to go down on the Mount Rushmore of Steeler players, and so I know that they're talking-- Mr. Rooney, our principal owner, and Kevin Colbert and Coach Tomlin and, you know, they always do a good job. So we'll see what happens.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of Coach Tomlin, the NFL only has three black coaches. What's wrong here, and how do you fix that?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. I had the privilege of being close to Mr. Rooney, Mr. Dan Rooney, who the Rooney Rule is named for. I cannot express what a fine human being he was. I miss him dearly. And recently, his wife had passed away, just the classiest people you ever want to know, and it was so important to him. And I think that we have to-- it's great that we have an interview process, but I think we have to be able to do more.

And I think part of that is what sort of other support can we provide, and I know we have some amazing coaches. There are candidates I'd certainly like to see have head coach, maybe not in our division because they're incredibly talented, but I think it's something that you have to constantly weigh and measure and not just say, hey, we put a rule in place. You know, you're doing the best that you can.

Well, if it's not working, what else can we do to keep progressing forward and make sure that we're doing that? I mean, one of the most profound experiences of my life, to go back to the movie thing, but I had the absolute pleasure of-- we made the movie ""42"" about Jackie Robinson. And certainly, that experience frames a lot of my thinking. And, you know, the opportunity that we all get a real shot, right? And, you know, are weighed on the merits, but that we have justice, and we're treated the same before the law, and that we have an opportunity.

If we have the skills, then we should be able to fill those spots. And I think we have a lot of work to go because we're not there yet. So I think we just have to constantly ask ourselves, what's working, what isn't working, and what can we tweak to make sure that this is dynamic and is ever changing to rise to the challenge?

ANDY SERWER: Let me go from football to baseball. Curt Schilling asked to be removed from the ballot for the Hall of Fame. You sit on the Hall of Fame board and will make the decision on it. Should he stay on the ballot or be removed, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: You know, these are just incredibly unique times. I know that we're going to be briefed on the situation. You know, I'd love to know really what the thinking is, but look, on the other hand, if a player says, I don't want to be associated or considered with the Hall of Fame, which I think is a privilege, then I'm not sure that player should be considered.

I mean, you have to take each individual case, and I certainly want to learn more. But to me, what would be ideal is to have the Hall of Fame be sort of away from politics and away from things of that nature and just say, hey, it's here to celebrate the game of baseball and certainly the right conduct and all those other things, but you just hate to see things get twisted up is all.

ANDY SERWER: You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking about whether anyone had ever turned down an induction. People have turned down Oscars before.

THOMAS TULL: Mm-hm.

ANDY SERWER: Right? Just putting that out there. It's interesting.

THOMAS TULL: Sure.

ANDY SERWER: It's part of the thinking.

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. That's one of the things just overall that I think is great about this country and the freedom it affords is that I don't have to agree with everything that you say, and hopefully we're able in a civil way to exchange ideas and not be afraid to exchange ideas in a civil tone. And, you know, hopefully we can progress to that place.

ANDY SERWER: You grew up in a low income family raised by a single mom in upstate New York, earned an athletic scholarship to a NESCAC school-- got to get a NESCAC pitch in there-- Hamilton College.

THOMAS TULL: Yup.

ANDY SERWER: I'm a NESCAC guy, too. Launched laundromats, as I mentioned, after graduation. So how did that early life experience shape you, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think knowing what it feels like to truly-- you know, there's not another euphemism. We were poor. I mean, if you know what it's like to go to bed hungry or have the lights turned off, you know, it has an impact. And I also looked at my mother who's a dental hygienist and she worked two jobs, and I watched her do that and do whatever was necessary, and just day after day.

And that's, I think thematically for me, that there are heroes that do amazing things in the moment they're called upon. I'm also always impressed with people that answer the bell every day, right, that are doing things when no one's looking and there's no extra credit, right? It's not on Instagram. It's just, hey, I'm getting up and I'm doing what I need to do, and I think that's heroic in itself. You know, my grandmother, her mother was a hospital cleaning lady, which is one of the toughest jobs that I can think of.

And so I just think, from a young age, understanding that you better have resiliency and that, whether you like it or not, whatever the circumstances are, that's what you have to deal with. So, you know, any of that certainly comes from them and from the experiences I had. And then the other side of it, anybody who gets anywhere, I think, has to make peace with the fact that there is absolutely luck involved because things could go inch to the left, inch to the right, and your life is completely different.

And I try to really keep that in mind that if you start to think, jeez, I'm in a different place and pretty special, you better keep that thinking at bay because I think that it's not correct, and it's dangerous thinking.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, Thomas, have you thought about what you'd like your legacy to be?

THOMAS TULL: Look, I feel like every single day I get to live a life that I couldn't even imagine. So I think, hopefully, my number one thing is I've got two 11-year-old twin boys that are at the center of my world, and being a good father is a very big deal to me. And I'd also say just that, you know, doing the things that I have the reach or impact to be able to do to help because I think, in our country citizenship, is something that you have to work at it. You have an obligation to be informed.

And if you have the opportunity through philanthropically or some way to help to be impactful in your community, you have to do those things. And so I just hope that-- you have to earn that every single day. And so I think a lot about that and, you know, but I'm in a place that I'm still trying to earn that rather than thinking about what it is. So hopefully we can keep it going.

ANDY SERWER: Sounds good. Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco. Thank you so much for your time.

THOMAS TULL: Thank you, Andy.

37,2021-02-25T01:24:50+00:00,Apple Partner Foxconn to Form EV Partnership With Fisker,"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group will develop an electric vehicle with Fisker Inc., part of the manufacturer’s efforts to boost its automotive capabilities at a time when technology companies including its main customer, Apple Inc., are looking to expand in vehicles.

The car will be built by Foxconn, targeted at multiple markets including North America, Europe, China and India, and sold under the Fisker brand, according to a joint statement from the companies Wednesday. Production is set to start in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Fisker is looking to break new ground with its second planned model. The startup plans to make a vehicle that doesn’t fit into an existing segment, like a sedan or SUV. Its partnership with Foxconn, a Taiwanese smartphone maker which is new to the auto business, is pinned on hopes that the collaboration will bring innovative manufacturing.

“The auto industry is very stale,” company founder Henrik Fisker said in an interview. “We still talk about adopting the Toyota manufacturing system,” referring to a production and logistics concept that was developed decades ago.

Fisker plans to design and market the vehicle while Foxconn will supply the skateboard chassis and manage supply chain and assembly. That’s asking a lot of a company that has never built cars in large volume before.

“I have full confidence that they can do this and maybe have ideas that are outside the box,” Fisker said.

Shares of Fisker rose 39% to a record of $22.58 at the close in New York. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the main listed arm of Foxconn, advanced as much as 5% in Taipei.

Foxconn in October introduced its first-ever EV chassis and a software platform aimed at helping automakers bring models to the market faster. This month, Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu said two light vehicles based on the Foxconn platform will be unveiled in the fourth quarter. Foxconn is also planning to help launch an electric bus around the same time.

Story continues

The Taiwanese company is expected to build more than 250,000 vehicles annually for the Fisker partnership, according to the statement. Foxconn may choose to make some of those cars in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter said. Following Wednesday’s memorandum of understanding, the two sides said they will enter a formal agreement in the second quarter of 2021.

Fisker is the second battery-powered car venture founded by its namesake founder, a longtime auto designer. Its debut model, the Ocean electric SUV, is scheduled to start production in late 2022. Henrik Fisker’s first venture, Fisker Automotive, filed for bankruptcy in 2013.

The model built by Foxconn will be an all-new type of vehicle, Fisker said. He wouldn’t classify it as a sedan or an SUV. Its design will defy segmentation the way the Volkswagen AG did with the Beetle and BMW AG did with the all-new Mini that came out in 2001, he said.

Fisker got the idea of the planned vehicle when he was reading about Apple’s plans for a car. He said he began sketching what he thought a tech company would build if one went into the car business.

“It will be like nothing you’ve seen before,” Fisker said.

Foxconn is the second major manufacturer Fisker has announced a partnership with since reaching a deal to go public last year. In October, the EV startup said Magna International Inc. would help it build the Ocean SUV.

In January, Foxconn signed a manufacturing deal with embattled Chinese electric-vehicle startup Byton Ltd. with the aim to start mass production of the Byton M-Byte by the first quarter of 2022. A week later, Foxconn and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. announced they were joining forces to provide production and consulting services to global automotive enterprises.

Amid reports of Apple’s car project gaining momentum, Foxconn has bulked up its automotive capabilities that could make it a major contender to make cars for its largest customer.

With development work still at an early stage, Apple will take at least half a decade to launch an autonomous electric vehicle, people with knowledge of the efforts have told Bloomberg News. That suggests the company is in no hurry to decide on potential auto-industry partners.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: Let's stay on the economy and talk a bit more about everything happening in the markets. We're joined now by Kristen Bitterly. She is the regional head of investments for North America at Citi Private Bank. Kristen, thanks for joining the program this morning. I'd love to start with rates and what you guys are thinking about the signal we can reliably say is coming from the long end of the bond market and how you're trying to decompose some of those pressures that maybe have investors worried or maybe folks are just looking through.

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so the price action that we've seen obviously in broader markets and particularly within rates, this has been driving everything over the past couple of days. And this question about, OK, should we be worried about inflation, the curve steepening, what does that mean for growth stocks? And so in terms of how we've been positioned going into this, we've actually been pulling back from some of what we call the COVID defensive stocks that have really seen a run over the past 12 months and then rotating into what we call COVID cyclicals. So we've been doing that rotation. And we've also been positioning our portfolios in anticipation of some of this inflationary concern as well as rising rates.

Because as the data gets better-- So some of the things you were just talking about. So the consumer savings rate, the average savings rate in the US is twice the amount it was last year. As we think about this pent-up demand and when that actually, when the 15% of the global economy that's currently shut down, when that actually comes back online, what does that mean? So looking at our portfolios, basically, if you're looking at this curve steepening, what things are punitive? It's cash and duration.

Story continues

So where we're positioned right now is we're trying to find ways of augmenting income without taking on duration. And we're actually trying to convince people that cash is punitive. Because when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis, you're almost guaranteed to lose value.

- Well, seeing that people have seemingly been pouring money into lots of stuff that has a higher return, maybe they're getting that message that cash is punitive right now. I want to pick up on the discussion we were just having about consumer confidence. I don't know where in the world you are. But this sort of perception that maybe we're a little skewed here in the Northeast in terms of how open the economy is. Both anecdotally and the actual data, how optimistic are you in terms of economic growth right now?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: So I'm in the Northeast as well. So in terms of-- I'm here in Brooklyn. So in terms of my own perception of it, I can say that I definitely feel that that 15% of the global economy is still definitely shut down where it may be more open depending upon climate. I think that consumer confidence, we still see-- so, yes, there's certain parts of the market where people are pouring money into the market. And we've seen that. But we also do see that hesitancy in terms of getting invested. And so I can understand that consumer confidence kind of being right in the middle, that there is improving data, right? So you have this element of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines.

You also have more-- more vaccines coming to market, right, and more efficacious treatment. So this idea that you could see a summer that would be a little bit more normal I think is something that, that consumers are getting comfortable with. And they are starting to think about planning things like vacations and how basically they're going to be coming back to normal in a post-pandemic world. But we've seen spending-- so you guys were mentioning kind of the spending in terms of home improvements and the first time someone bought a drill.

We've seen that type of spending. But, obviously, there still is this pent-up demand. And there still is a pent up demand for all of those really heavy-hit COVID cyclical industries, which is something that will drive the consumer behavior, and I think ultimately something that will be a reinforcement of whether we actually see strong consumer confidence.

- Kristen, is too much being made out of the rise in 10-year yields? It's not as if the 10-year is at 4%. It's at 1.4%, remains very low historically. Are you at that point where 1.4% is triggering you to make changes in your portfolios?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: You know what I think the market is wrestling with right now? So when we look at the 10-year where it's at, we almost have to go back and say, look, the 10-year in December of 2019 was at 1.9%. So the economy was functioning very, very well. Technology and growth stocks were actually continuing to dominate the market and grow. And so I think what the market is wrestling with right now is whether this rotation that we're seeing, is it a rotation or is it catch-up of COVID cyclicals? So the price action that we see today, obviously, you're seeing some of that rotation. You're seeing financials perform very well. You're seeing tech hurt a little bit. But I think one of the questions that we're all struggling with is really kind of pivoting more to real earnings as opposed to expectations.

And so what I mean by that is yes, you can see why financials would perform well with the curve steepening. You can see parts of, once the economy reopens, those sectors actually doing particularly well. But I think one question on everyone's mind is so when you look at some of these companies that have been dominating the market-- so let's talk about the big five, right, so like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook-- when you look at them, they're right now around 18% of market cap. But they're 25% of earnings. And so in terms of representation from a contribution of earnings standpoint, you can almost make the argument that they're underrepresented. And so I think the focus and what everyone's going to be watching very closely is can these companies actually continue these really stellar earnings and continue to deliver even as we move to a post COVID-world?

MYLES UDLAND: Now Kristen, something you flagged to us is that all your clients or many of your clients are asking about if we're in a bubble. How that fits in here, I think everyone likes talking about it because the big fun word to say. And related to that also is the crypto conversation. All this speculation that happens, not just in financial markets, but tangential to financial markets, how are you guys talking through some of those concerns or maybe the FOMO, perhaps, that the [? senior ?] client base is having if they are not really allocated to those kinds of areas?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so are we-- the question about are we in a bubble and where to put capital to work, I think you always have to put it into perspective. My colleague Robert Buckland did a really great piece, an op-ed piece in the ""Financial Times"" that walked through just putting it into perspective compared to 2000, for example. And if we look at the price action not just over the past-- I think everyone's looking at this price action since March and since the depths of the pandemic. But if we take a step back and we actually look at over the past three years, what price action are we seeing in equity markets? Well, the past three years, you can say the NASDAQ is up 90%. So 30% per annum, that's actually very, very strong. We all would agree with that.

But going into the tech bubble, it was completely different. It was around 300%. US equities up around 36%, so 12% per annum. Once we got outside the US though, it's a very different story. So emerging markets up 12% over that time period, the DAX flat, UK equity is are actually negative over that same time period. So I think the one thing is when you're looking at, are we in a bubble? There are parts of the market that, yes, feel that way, look that way, seem overheated. And that's why I go back to, are they-- are these parts of the market, are they delivering on earnings or not?

And the other thing is to focus on, where haven't you seen some of the snapback? Where are you looking from a relative valuation standpoint that's attractive? And an example of that, global health care. So global health care, you would think in a pandemic, right, in a pandemic, health care would absolutely be rallying. But what we've seen is on a relative PE basis, it's at the lowest levels relative to global equities in about a decade.

So we like health care for a variety of reasons, not just because of the pandemic, but more of a demographic argument. But it's a strong sector, high free cash flow generating. So there's areas of the market where it makes a lot of sense to invest-- not only short term, but long term.

So you have this element of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines.

You also have more-- more vaccines coming to market, right, and more efficacious treatment. So this idea that you could see a summer that would be a little bit more normal I think is something that, that consumers are getting comfortable with. And they are starting to think about planning things like vacations and how basically they're going to be coming back to normal in a post-pandemic world. But we've seen spending-- so you guys were mentioning kind of the spending in terms of home improvements and the first time someone bought a drill.

We've seen that type of spending. But, obviously, there still is this pent-up demand. And there still is a pent up demand for all of those really heavy-hit COVID cyclical industries, which is something that will drive the consumer behavior, and I think ultimately something that will be a reinforcement of whether we actually see strong consumer confidence.

- Kristen, is too much being made out of the rise in 10-year yields? It's not as if the 10-year is at 4%. It's at 1.4%, remains very low historically. Are you at that point where 1.4% is triggering you to make changes in your portfolios?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: You know what I think the market is wrestling with right now? So when we look at the 10-year where it's at, we almost have to go back and say, look, the 10-year in December of 2019 was at 1.9%. So the economy was functioning very, very well. Technology and growth stocks were actually continuing to dominate the market and grow. And so I think what the market is wrestling with right now is whether this rotation that we're seeing, is it a rotation or is it catch-up of COVID cyclicals? So the price action that we see today, obviously, you're seeing some of that rotation. You're seeing financials perform very well. You're seeing tech hurt a little bit. But I think one of the questions that we're all struggling with is really kind of pivoting more to real earnings as opposed to expectations.

And so what I mean by that is yes, you can see why financials would perform well with the curve steepening. You can see parts of, once the economy reopens, those sectors actually doing particularly well. But I think one question on everyone's mind is so when you look at some of these companies that have been dominating the market-- so let's talk about the big five, right, so like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook-- when you look at them, they're right now around 18% of market cap. But they're 25% of earnings. And so in terms of representation from a contribution of earnings standpoint, you can almost make the argument that they're underrepresented. And so I think the focus and what everyone's going to be watching very closely is can these companies actually continue these really stellar earnings and continue to deliver even as we move to a post COVID-world?

MYLES UDLAND: Now Kristen, something you flagged to us is that all your clients or many of your clients are asking about if we're in a bubble. How that fits in here, I think everyone likes talking about it because the big fun word to say. And related to that also is the crypto conversation. All this speculation that happens, not just in financial markets, but tangential to financial markets, how are you guys talking through some of those concerns or maybe the FOMO, perhaps, that the [? senior ?] client base is having if they are not really allocated to those kinds of areas?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so are we-- the question about are we in a bubble and where to put capital to work, I think you always have to put it into perspective. My colleague Robert Buckland did a really great piece, an op-ed piece in the ""Financial Times"" that walked through just putting it into perspective compared to 2000, for example. And if we look at the price action not just over the past-- I think everyone's looking at this price action since March and since the depths of the pandemic. But if we take a step back and we actually look at over the past three years, what price action are we seeing in equity markets? Well, the past three years, you can say the NASDAQ is up 90%. So 30% per annum, that's actually very, very strong. We all would agree with that.

But going into the tech bubble, it was completely different. It was around 300%. US equities up around 36%, so 12% per annum. Once we got outside the US though, it's a very different story. So emerging markets up 12% over that time period, the DAX flat, UK equity is are actually negative over that same time period. So I think the one thing is when you're looking at, are we in a bubble? There are parts of the market that, yes, feel that way, look that way, seem overheated. And that's why I go back to, are they-- are these parts of the market, are they delivering on earnings or not?

And the other thing is to focus on, where haven't you seen some of the snapback? Where are you looking from a relative valuation standpoint that's attractive? And an example of that, global health care. So global health care, you would think in a pandemic, right, in a pandemic, health care would absolutely be rallying. But what we've seen is on a relative PE basis, it's at the lowest levels relative to global equities in about a decade.

So we like health care for a variety of reasons, not just because of the pandemic, but more of a demographic argument. But it's a strong sector, high free cash flow generating. So there's areas of the market where it makes a lot of sense to invest-- not only short term, but long term.

46,2021-02-23T19:00:58+00:00,It’s ‘not necessarily the greatest environment for government bonds’: Strategist,"Brian Jacobsen, Multi-Asset Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, joins Yahoo Finance’s Kristin Myers to reflect on the rise in yields and how investors should be reallocating their portfolios amid tech sell-off.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, market action right now, again, remains in the red as we see big tech sell off, NASDAQ down about 2 and 3/10 of a percentage point. As we've been talking about investors rotating out of some of those big tech names, we are seeing Tesla taking a huge hit today in the red. You can see right there some of those tech stocks under pressure, Tesla down over 5% right now, Apple down also 2.7%, and Zoom right now down over 5%.

We've got Brian Jacobsen here with us. He's a Wells Fargo Asset Management multi-asset strategist. Brian, always good to have you with us. So let's start with what Jay Powell was talking about today, again, soothing some of these fears around inflation, and yesterday, when talking about the rising bond yields. UBS's Tom McLoughlin said to us that this was transitory, echoing some of what we heard from Powell today. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on this.

BRIAN JACOBSEN: Yeah, so obviously, there's been quite the move up in yields. And unfortunately, it's been in the yields that are probably most relevant to helping support this economic recovery. Right, a lot of people look at the overnight rate for the federal funds rate, and it's not that relevant to them. But when you see it showing up in the 10-year Treasury yield or mortgage rates, then it becomes real. And you can understand why these move ups in yields can really give some investors a little moment of pause.

But Chair Powell seems to suggest, which we agree, is that the yields have moving up for kind of a good reason. Initially, it was rising inflation expectations. That seems relatively contained. But now it's more because of the better growth outlook. So our big concern is whether or not we have moved up too far, too fast, at least for the market to be able to digest it. Maybe that's why we've had a bit of a pullback in the last couple of days. But as long as we don't go up too much higher than where we are, let's say 1.5% on the 10-year Treasury, it shouldn't really be too much of a headwind for the broader economic recovery.

Story continues

KRISTIN MYERS: And the 10-year right now holding steady, just below 1.4 now. I see that 1.5 is that level that you got-- that you are giving us right now. What are you thinking in terms of timing either for the markets to kind of digest some of this news as you were saying, or for investors really to go back into the markets and for some of those yields to come down?

BRIAN JACOBSEN: Well, we think that from a time frame perspective here, that it's really about what's next for the Fed, the next speech. Obviously, we'd like it if it was tied to the calendar, as to when their next meeting is. Oftentimes, it's the slip of the tongue that tends to move yields either up or down. If you remember back to 2013 with then chair Ben Bernanke, the famous taper tantrum just because he said in a speech, at some point, we're going to be stopping this asset purchase program not now, not tomorrow, but at some point in the future. And the market sold off on that, yields rose.

We think that the Federal Reserve is going to be very careful in trying to craft and control their messaging around that. So we think that we could see maybe a slow grind higher with yields. Which makes us very optimistic about the outlook for equities. Not necessarily the greatest environment for government bonds, but we think it's actually very good for equities and for the more what are called the credit sensitive parts of the market, like high yield bonds and lower quality investment grade debt.

KRISTIN MYERS: Looking out at equities over the rest of the year, of course, we saw big tech under pressure today, and we've kept hearing that big tech probably isn't going to be leading the market in 2021. So for some of our investors out there, especially some of the folks that really got in during the pandemic, how should they be thinking about reallocating their portfolios in this current environment?

BRIAN JACOBSEN: The way that we're trying to coach our clients and the way that we're managing our clients' money is to really try to pivot more into those parts of the market that have underperformed, not just over the last year, but really, if you think about it, the last, say, five years or even the last 10 years. Is there some maybe valuation catch-up that can happen?

That would be more with what are called the value part of the spectrum. So if you think about, like, financials and industrials, companies that typically trade at lower market multiples-- so the earnings per share relative to their market prices-- those have underperformed over the last 10 years or so. And so those are areas that we find very attractive and should benefit, we think, from a continued economic improvement.

But then there's also a broad net when you look outside of the United States, as far as emerging markets and even in Europe and Japan. And so, for us, we're encouraging clients to continue to sort of lean into those parts of the market that most underperformed because we believe that the economic fundamentals are improving, and that this isn't just some sort of ephemeral one to two-year bounce in growth, that this actually has a lot of legs to it.

47,2021-02-23T16:31:46+00:00,Gary Vaynerchuk provides playbook on how to improve investment outcomes,"Gary Vaynerchuk, VaynerMedia CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how investors can gain back losses from tech sell-off, what is driving the surge in investing increase, and what to know about the Clubhouse app.

Video Transcript

BRIAN SOZZI: GameStop mania is taking a breather for a bit but remains top of mind among traders and those active on social media. Let's gauge what may happen next with all this with VaynerMedia CEO, Gary Vaynerchuk. Gary, always good to speak with you here.

I was thinking last night coming into this segment that a lot of people have been hurt financially from the sell-offs in a GameStop off the high, sell-offs in Bitcoin, you name it. How could they come back financially, and even emotionally, from suffering those type of losses?

GARY VAYNERCHUK: I mean, it all comes down to the individual situation. What you hope, Brian-- unfortunately, I've heard many stories of the opposite, is that some people took out loans to buy GameStop, because they got excited in the moment. And so you know, I think the Bitcoin sell-offs are minor. I mean, where Bitcoin is right now in comparison-- you're talking about normality.

I think the GameStop situation was so unique in so many different ways. And how they come back financially and emotionally is going to come down to who they are as a human being. I think the same person that is under-educated and just rides a wave on emotion and hype may be in a vulnerable spot to deal with the downside of that. Others took calculated risks. My hope is that they see the big picture and don't value of money enough, and are able to move on because they're happy as a human, not worried about an extra dollar in their bank account.

BRIAN SOZZI: Gary, is there a playbook that they can follow, like three steps to help improve this or improve their outcomes?

GARY VAYNERCHUK: Step one, know what you're doing with your money. There's a lot of places where I've been offered incredible opportunities, it seemed, on paper, but I just genuinely didn't fully understand it.

Story continues

You have a ton of people right now putting money into the public market, putting money into cryptos, putting money into startups. And really, they're chasing. They're chasing the momentum of the conversation that the media outlets are talking about, that social media is talking about, that forums are talking about, communities are talking about.

Number one, two, and three is be educated. Know what you're doing with your money. There's incredible opportunity in front of us. I mean, this program is going to be talking about NFTs at an insanely high level. The problem is, 96% of NFT projects are going to be financial losers. So get educated, and then attack.

MYLES UDLAND: Gary, I want to ask you about NFTs. But I'll ask that next. I want to start, though, with-- so here at Yahoo Finance, we talk about stocks all the time. To me, the market seems like the most important thing in the world. But it's not.

I'm curious, from your vantage point, how you feel like the zeitgeist-- it feels to me like everyone now wants to talk stocks. Everyone wants to talk about markets. Does it seem that way to you? And what do you think's behind that energy?

GARY VAYNERCHUK: I think entrepreneurship had a 10-year, incredible run. And we just saw a ton around entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship. So then you had the Robinhood effect, where you just had an enormous amount of very young human beings jumping into the dynamics.

You know, you go high school today, and more boys and girls want to be entrepreneurs or influencers that monetize off brand deals or start their own products than anything else in the world-- not rap stars, not athletes. So capitalism, in a 3.0 world of this new individuality capability because of devices like this, have created a really interesting variable.

So you're right, a lot of people have gotten into the market. But that same energy is also in drop shipping, starting a Shopify store, buying crypto, NFT, investing. Entrepreneurship, thus investing, has taken over an entire generation.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, it feels like business is the new sports or whatever, however you want to frame that kind of thing.

GARY VAYNERCHUK: 100%, because the cost of entry is so low. And the problem is, too many people aren't self-aware and don't realize they're not entrepreneurs or investors. And unfortunately, they're going to have to learn that lesson, because the market is unemotional. And it's going to do what it wants to do, whether you're a billionaire who's upset about Reddit or whether you're a kid that gets caught in an exciting moment but then gets slammed.

The market is the market is the market. It has no emotions. It is not picking sides. And people will win and lose on the truth of the end consumer's actions.

MYLES UDLAND: So speaking of sports, let's talk about NFTs. Tell me what I need to know about Top Shot and just what is going on there. Because I'm only 30, but I feel like a Boomer when I look at some of this stuff.

GARY VAYNERCHUK: You know what's so funny? A lot of people are trying to connect their Coinbase to their MetaMask right now, and they're like scared. And I keep making fun of them, because I'm like, you made fun of your parents for not wanting to put a credit card into a website nine years ago, and now you're the Boomer.

There's a lot going on in NFTs. The digitalization of everything in our society, social currency-- the reason people care about a blue check on Instagram is the same reason this is going to be huge. IP is going to see an incredible amount of dollars. Artists, both digital artists and music artists, are going to find a platform that is going to allow them to monetize without people sitting in the middle taking a piece of the cut.

This is going to be an incredibly big revolution. And NBA Top Shot is an incredibly big platform, because NBA IP is so hot. Sports cards have been so hot. NFT is getting hot. So that was a perfect storm. Big shoutout to those individuals.

You've got Sorare, which I wrote a tiny $25,000 check into. But I bought more in the actual soccer cards there. I think you're going to see a lot about Sorare talking about giving football's, AKA soccer's, global footprint.

And then you've got the overall NFT market, which is just about to-- and I wasn't kidding. This program is going to spend an enormous amount of time this summer, fall, and winter talking NFT.

MYLES UDLAND: Let's talk also a little bit about Clubhouse and what you see happening there, and just maybe where that fits into. I mean, the NFT concept of, I can monetize myself more efficiently, makes something like Clubhouse, as far as I see it, more attractive for the high-school kid who wants to build a brand, be an entrepreneur easily. How do you kind of see the Clubhouse thing playing out?

GARY VAYNERCHUK: Clubhouse is an interesting double-edged sword on what you just said. You can easily build a huge brand on TikTok or YouTube. But that's content that you post-produce. I think you can build an enormous reputation, a huge brand on Clubhouse. Here's the problem. You have to know what you're talking about.

I actually see a lot of people that have had decent social media brands getting exposed on Clubhouse for not actually knowing their expertise. And so it may seem like they're doing well, because they have a lot of people in the rooms. But meanwhile, behind the scenes, the A players, the real players are chirping about, wait a minute, they don't really know the subject matter. Because you can't hide in a live audio environment.

So I think Clubhouse is an incredible place to grow your brand and to have things happen. I also think it's an incredible place to lose brand reality, because there's more truth in it than your post-produced piece of content that maybe somebody else helped you make.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well said. All right, let's leave it there. VaynerMedia CEO Gary Vaynerchuk, always good to see you. Stay safe. We'll talk to you soon.

50,2021-02-23T01:00:00+00:00,Should You Follow Buffett Into Energy Stocks?,"For decades, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett maintained a pretty conservative approach to investing, favoring retail and banking stocks while avoiding sectors such as tech and energy. However, he finally pulled the trigger on PetroChina Co. (NYSE:PTR) in 2002 and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2011. The Oracle's foray into energy and tech initially paid off after he realized a tidy $3.5B profit on PetroChina, while his $90 billion Apple stake now represents a ridiculous 20% of Berkshire Hathaway's market value.

However, Buffett has lately been doubling down on his energy investments while trimming his tech and banking holdings.

After a period of relative calm last year, Warren finally announced some long-awaited investments, including a $4.1 billion investment in Chevron Inc. (NYSE:CVX), good for a nearly 2.5% stake in the giant oil company. Chevron is now the conglomerate's 10th biggest equity holding.

Meanwhile, Buffett trimmed its holding in Apple to 887.1M shares from 944.3M and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) to 52.4M from 127.4M shares, according to Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F filing.

Berkshire Hathaway has always operated on Buffett's famous ethos of buying when the market is fearful and selling when it gets greedy. It, therefore, came as a huge surprise that the giant conglomerate remained muted when the market crashed in April despite sitting in a massive $137 billion cash hoard. But it appears that the energy sector has become too much of a bargain for Buffett to continue ignoring.

It's also a clear sign that Buffett sees long-term value in a sector that's been taking plenty of flak lately.

Buffett is not the only billionaire who's doubling down on energy. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET),PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) worth more than $800 million combined are now in David Tepper's top 12 holdings.

Here's a peek into Buffett's latest energy buys.

#1. Chevron

Chevron stock plunged to its lowest level since 2006 after the pandemic crashed the oil and gas sector, and has failed to fully recover despite a bright start to the year.

The integrated energy company posted a net loss of $5.5 billion for FY 2020, and the stock is currently trading 15% lower than a year ago.

With so much uncertainty surrounding the oil and gas sector and fears that it might be years before oil prices can fully recover to pre-pandemic levels, the ability of a company to withstand a prolonged bust cycle is an important consideration.

And...Chevron wins the stress test by a country mile.

Wood Mackenzie, a global energy, renewables, and mining research and consultancy group, has reported that Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) are the most resilient, thanks to their robust deepwater projects and LNG as well as less exposure to high-cost assets.

Investing in Big Oil companies like Chevron comes with some risks, though.

Wall Street has been rapidly raising its climate standards, with BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, recently disclosing plans to pressure companies to do a lot more to lower their carbon emissions by leveraging the massive weight of his firm mammoth asset base.

Chevron has not been moving as quickly as some of its European rivals and continues to expand its oil footprint, including its $5 billion purchase of Noble Energy last year. CVX has failed to make major investments in solar and wind beyond supporting its own power needs, meaning buying Chevron is a bet that oil demand will fully recover from Covid-19 despite growing public pressure.

That's a possibility, but no longer seen as a given.

Perhaps Buffet's gamble will pay off, but it's clear the road ahead won't be easy.

#2. Dominion Energy

In July, Berkshire bought natural gas transmission and storage assets of Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D), paying $4 billion in cash for the assets, and assuming $5.7 billion in debt.

Under the deal, Berkshire Hathaway Energy acquired 100% of Dominion Energy Transmission, Carolina Gas Transmission, and Questar Pipeline as well as 50% of the Iroquois Gas Transmission System. Berkshire also landed 25% of Cove Point LNG, one of just six export-import and storage facilities for liquefied natural gas in the U.S.

The purchase greatly increases Berkshire's footprint in the natural gas business, increasing its carrying market share to 18% of all interstate natural gas transmission in the United States, up from 8% previously.

And that might turn out to be one of Buffett's better energy buys.

With bond yields stuck at historic lows, Barron's recently said that the best yield opportunities are clustered in the equity markets, ranking energy pipelines as the best income investment opportunity for 2021 ahead of dividend stocks, electric utilities, REITs, telecoms, convertibles, and junk bonds in that order.

Dominion Energy also has better green credentials than most of its peers.

Dominion Energy has outlined plans to spend a massive $72B on capital investment in decarbonization by 2035, which it estimates should help drive a 10% annual shareholder return for its regulated utility operations, making it the largest regulated decarbonization investment opportunity in the country.

Dominion plans to spend $32B during 2021-25 to support its ""clean-energy profile,"" which it estimates will generate 6.5% annual EPS growth and a ~3.5% dividend yield for a ~10% total shareholder return.

Dominion Energy has been selling off after recently cutting its dividend, but thankfully, its peers Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) and Salient Midstream & MLP (NYSE:SMM) are still decent picks.

#3. Suncor Energy

According to Berkshire Hathaway's 13-F filings for Q2, the company bought around five million shares of Canadian oil kingpin Suncor Energy Inc. (TSX:SU) (NYSE:SU) during the second quarter. Berkshire now owns 19.2 million shares of Suncor worth ~US$217 million.

At first glance, Buffett's purchase of Suncor stock appears to have been driven by his long-term ethos to buy companies that are undervalued compared to their intrinsic values. After all, Suncor never truly recovered from the 2014 oil crisis and has been on a particularly sharp downtrend over the past two years. The Covid-19 pandemic and the oil price war only served to exacerbate the stock's unfortunate trend.

But there could be something deeper than that.

It appears Warren Buffett is a big fan of Suncor's assets, especially its long-lived oilfields with a lifespan of approximately 26 years. Suncor's dependable assets have helped the company generate stable cash flows and pay out consistently high dividends. Suncor had consistently increased dividends since it began distribution in 1992 till the 2008 financial crisis. The company, however, slashed the dividend by 55% in April due to the pandemic, but boasts a still respectable forward yield of 4.6%. Thankfully, the deep dividend cut really helped shore Suncor's balance sheet which is now among the most resilient among its peers.

In fact, Suncor revealed that it requires WTI prices to be north of $35/barrel to meet capex and dividend payouts. With WTI prices now in the high 50s, Suncor appears well placed to maintain that dividend and maybe even raise it in the not-so-distant future.

51,2021-02-23T00:00:00+00:00,"Lithium Prices Soar As Tesla, Apple And Google Fight For Supply","The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is gaining serious momentum.

According to experts’ projections, demand for electric vehicles should rise at a 21.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) until 2026.

The extraordinary demand that is forecast for EVs over the next five years has now begun to trigger a massive disruption in the global energy markets.

As demand for EVs continues to move higher, the demand for lithium – the critical component needed for the batteries that power all those EVs – is also projected to climb higher.

According to Roskill Information Services, “lithium chemical demand from end-use sectors is expected to increase year-on-year to around 280,000 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent.”

These projections have already begun to have a profound impact on the price of lithium in the marketplace.

Lithium prices declined from 2018 through the end of 2020, but since December 1, 2020 the price of lithium has soared 71.24% -- and could be poised to climb even higher.

With rising lithium prices and soaring projected demand, what are some of the best ways for investors to play this EV-powered trend for maximum upside potential?

With rising lithium prices and soaring projected demand, what is the best high risk/reward way for investors to play this EV-powered trend for maximum upside potential?

One under-the-radar company, United Lithium Corp., appears that it could be at the right place at the right time.

Its flagship project is a recently discovered lithium deposit located in central Sweden. The company has agreed on terms to acquire the project, with closing expected by April.

This project is a near-surface, near-market, exploration-stage lithium property that appears poised to help the company take advantage of Europe’s soaring demand for electric vehicles, and the EU’s strong push for lithium self-sufficiency.

United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby Project: A Near-Surface, High-Grade Deposit Offering Significant Upside Potential

Story continues Sweden

The Bergby project is a recently discovered lithium-rich pegmatite deposit in central Sweden that offers an ideal location.

This property is near to the world-famous Woxna graphite mine, the new Northvolt lithium battery gigafactory and close to major mining and transportation infrastructure, workforce and equipment suppliers.

The Bergby project, if proven up as a commercial deposit, is optimally positioned to benefit from access to the EU market and its growing demand for alternative energy vehicle manufacturing, high tech devices and grid storage systems.

In addition, the project’s proximity to next-generation lithium-ion battery manufacturing plants is critical, as is access to nearby EU educational institutions and low power costs for processing hard rock lithium-bearing minerals cost-effectively.

The Bergby lithium property should be able to capitalize on three key elements:

1. Probable low cost surface and near-surface extraction...

2. Well-established mining and transportation infrastructure, and...

3. Rapid fulfillment of trade regulations allowing tariff-free sales to potential EU lithium customers.

But the location of the Bergby lithium project is only part of the story of its potential.

Historic Sampling Shows Extensive Lithium Mineralization

Mapping and sampling of United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby property site defined an extensive field largely comprising boulders with abundant lithium-bearing minerals. Assayu

Assay results from 41 boulders shows Li2O (lithium oxide) values averaged 1.06% within a range from 0.03% to 4.56% Li2O; and Ta2O5 (tantalum pentoxide) assays averaged 168ppm, ranging from 1 ppm to 499 ppm Ta2O5.

Further mapping located lithium mineralization in outcrops. Fifteen samples collected from three outcrops returned Li2O values averaging 1.71%, ranging from 0.01% to 4.65% Li2O; and Ta2O5 values averaging 133 ppm within a range from 16 ppm to 803 ppm Ta2O5.

In 2017, the first and only drill program was completed at the Bergby project.

In that drilling program, 28 of the 33 holes drilled on the property intersected lithium mineralization along approximately 450m strike length.

The deepest holes tested to only 65m below surface with mineralization is still open along strike in both directions and well as down dip.

Three principal styles of lithium mineralization have been observed in widely -spread boulders and outcrops at the Bergby property, providing encouragement that mineralization may be extensively developed.

1. Homogeneous, fine grained to medium-grained leucogranite/aplite: Complex zoned boulders where the aplite material appears to intrude coarse-grained pegmatite. This style is rich in tantalum, with an average grade from 31 boulders of 208 ppm Ta2O5. The lithium mineralogy of this style is not yet confirmed, however, the measured specific gravity of highest-grade samples was relatively light and suggests petalite is a dominant mineral (LiAlSi4O10).

2. Petalite dominated extremely coarse-grained pegmatite: Located in both outcrop and boulders; this style is relatively high in lithium and poor in tantalum.

3. Spodumene-bearing, very coarse grained pegmatite: Coarse spodumene crystals (LiAl(SiO3)2 have been recognized in boulders, with crystals up to 30 cm in length.

What’s Next for United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby Project

The European Union has sounded the alarm on critical raw materials shortages, estimating that to meet its climate neutrality goal, it will need up to 18 times more lithium and five times more cobalt in 2030 than current consumption.

By 2050, the EU estimates that it will need a staggering 60 times more lithium than current demand.

For this reason, the EU has added lithium to its critical materials list and launched a multi-billion dollar fund to help speed the production of raw materials to supply the European battery market.

This means there is potential for significant capital available for projects such as United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby project as the scope of the project comes into focus.

Now that a discovery has been made at Bergby, the next task for United Lithium is to define the overall size and grade of the lithium and tantalum resource on the property.

The deposit at Bergby is open along the strike to the north and south...and there are additional known pegmatites in the area that have never been tested for lithium mineralization.

A simple drill program on the property of another 25 to 40 holes could be hugely impactful for the company in a relatively short period of time.

It’s possible that such a modest drilling program – one that the company has the financial resources to undertake – could be completed within the year with the goal of uncovering a discovery of several million tonnes at the property.

Bottom Line: Why the Future Could Be Bright for United Lithium Corp.

* Demand for lithium is soaring – and the price of lithium has shot up 71.24% in the last two months. With the worldwide shift toward electric vehicles in full swing, the world is desperately seeking to bring new supplies of lithium online...and the markets are likely to reward any company that can do so handsomely.

* United Lithium is a company whose primary asset showing lithium mineralization is in the right place at the right time, as the Bergby project’s location in Sweden is near the new Northvolt lithium battery gigafactory and close to transportation infrastructure.

* Drilling at the Bergby project has shown an extensive lithium-mineralized surface boulder field. 28 of the 33 holes drilled on the property in a 2017 drill program intersected lithium mineralization and the project showed potential high-grade, near-surface lithium potential.

* The company plans to move forward with an additional drill program in 2021 that could potentially reveal a lithium deposit discovery on the property. Positive results from this drill program could be a true game-changer for the company with Europe – and battery companies – so desperate to bring new lithium sources on line as quickly as possible.

Other companies dependent on the battery boom:

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leader in Big Tech’s sustainability push…but it’s more than just that. From the products themselves, to the packages they came in, and even the data centers powering them, Apple has gone above and beyond to cut the environmental impact.

But now, it’s even getting into the transportation business. ""We're focusing on autonomous systems. It's a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on."" Apple CEO Tim Cook on Apple's plans in the car space. Electric vehicles aren’t likely to be left out, either…

Apple's rumored car design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech giant that creates everything from software to hardware and more. This is important because not only does it help companies with exploration of minerals, it relies on them just as much. Microsoft is a company that is also going above and beyond in its emissions goals, aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. A feat that will not be an easy task for such a massive technology corporation. Why does that matter in the lithium race? Because the green energy boom will be destroyed without the vital metal

That’s why Bill Gates’ tech giant has made numerous investments in clean energy across the globe. From Ohio to the Netherlands, Microsoft is pouring millions into solar and wind projects to not only help reduce its own carbon footprint but also help neighboring communities do the same.

In addition to its investments and green operations, Microsoft is also getting into the auto-game. Microsoft’s Azure cloud-based infrastructure and edge computing is going to be pivotal in this new industry. Not only will it allow automakers to analyze data and optimize their products, but it will also give them the opportunity to conduct advanced tests and simulations to fine-tune their software in risk-free environments. It’s even partnering with leaders in the auto industry such as Renault and Audi.

Mark Everest, Information Systems Development Manager, Renault Sport Formula One Team noted, “There are so many factors that are constantly changing and can affect race strategy: track temperature, tire performance, what the other drivers are doing. Simulation helps us quickly understand how to configure the car for a particular track.""

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made major progress towards a more sustainable tomorrow. And as a chipmaker, it is reliant on the production of key metals and minerals such as copper and lithium. But what makes NVIDIA even more special is that it is tackling the ESG trend on all fronts. In fact, it was ranked as one of the world’s top 100 companies to work for due to its incredible working conditions, hiring practices and professional development programs. In addition to its ranking as one of the world’s top companies to work for, it was also ranked on MIT Tech Review’s 50 Smartest Companies list and the Human Rights Watch’s Corporate Equality Index.

Not only is Nvidia a role model for companies in its social and governance stance, it is also firmly committed to building a greener future, as well. From its push to use renewable energy in its day to day operations to its innovative technological advancements in chipmaking which reduce the amount of energy needed to power devices, Nvidia is checking all boxes for impact investors.

This year, Nvidia has done something that many other companies have struggled to do. Not only has it stayed afloat in one of the most trying years in recent history, it has thrived. Since January 2020, Nvidia’s share price has increased from $293 to $525, representing a noteworthy 80% increase in value.

While electric vehicles are the talk of Wall Street right now, autonomous vehicles are on the horizon as well, and they too will rely on a number of key metals and resources. And the leader in this push is Waymo, a subsidy of tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Waymo may just be the de facto leader in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry. It’s already had cars driving themselves across the United States for several years. In fact, in Arizona alone, Alphabet’s self-driving cars have logged over 6.1 million miles. To put that in perspective, that means that Alphabet’s autonomous cars have driven the distance between New York City and San Francisco over 2100 times. Or, as the company explains, “over 500 years of driving for the average licensed US driver.” Even more impressive, however, the vehicles were only involved in 47 “contact events”, and the vast-majority of the collisions were the result of human error and none resulted in any sort of severe injury for anyone involved.

While these tests are extremely promising for Alphabet’s Waymo, there are still some hurdles to overcome. First and foremost, these lengthy trials took place in Phoenix, a city not exactly known for extreme weather. Second, an issue that may frustrate many drivers, the vehicles operated in a sort of hyper-cautious mode, driving at slower speeds and taking sometimes unnecessary precautions to avoid conflict.

While Alphabet’s Waymo gets a lot of credit for these massive accomplishments, a widely loved and wildly popular chipmaker is at its core. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Waymo teamed up way back in 2017, and have worked together to fine tune their technology together ever since. Through their mutual knowledge of hardware and software, the tech giants have made leaps and bounds towards building the car of the future.

In addition to its efforts with Waymo, Intel has also been on the forefront of developing its own artificial intelligence and vision hardware. Back in 2017, it acquired MobileEye, a supplier of camera-based chips and software to the global mobile industry. And now, in a new deal with Luminar, another emerging tech company on the forefront of this movement, Intel is positioning itself as its own giant of this new sector.

Canada’s Silicon Valley is all in on the sustainability race, too. Shopify Inc (TSX:SH) Canada’s own e-commerce giant helps users build their own online stores. It has huge clients – everyone from Tesla to Budweiser are on board. And the company is beloved by millennial investors. In addition to its revolutionary approach on e-commerce, Shopify is playing an increasingly active role in creating a greener tomorrow. It has committed to spending at least $5 million annually to help combat climate change. It’s even making cuts throughout its own operations, decommissioning its data centers and sourcing renewable power for its buildings. Thanks the these efforts, Shopify has posted a return of 137% this year alone, and is showing no signs of slowing.

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (TSX:DSG) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses. Recently, Descartes announced that it has successfully deployed its advanced capacity matching solution, Descartes MacroPoint Capacity Matching. The solution provides greater visibility and transparency within their network of carriers and brokers. This move could solidify the company as a key player in transportation logistics which is essential-and-often-overlooked in the mitigation of rising carbon emissions.

Another way to get some indirect exposure to the booming tech, EV and mineral industries is through AutoCanada (TSX:ACQ), a company that operates auto-dealerships through Canada. The company carries a wide variety of new and used vehicles and has all types of financial options available to fit the needs of any consumer. While sales have slumped this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AutoCanada will likely see a rebound as both buying power and the demand for electric vehicles increases. As more new exciting EVs hit the market, AutoCanada will surely be able to ride the wave.

Burcon NutraScience Corporation (TSX:BU) is a Canadian tech firm rethinking the our diets. And while that may not seem exciting for minerals investors, it is a key stock to watch in the wider sustainability boom. With a focus on high-purity, sustainable, flavorful, and affordable products, Burcon has checked every box in the consumer’s book. Founded way back in 1998, the company has been at the forefront of the movement for over two decades, and it’s only become more refined since.

According to its mission statement, Burcon “seeks to improve the health and wellness of global consumers through the discovery and development of sustainable, functional and renewable plant-based products for the global food and beverage industries.”

Mogo Finance Technology Inc. (TSX:GO) is a new spin on unsecured credit, which is a burgeoning sub-segment of FinTech. Providing loan management, the ability to track spending, stress-free mortgages, and even credit score tracking, Mogo is at the forefront of an online movement to assist users with their financial needs.

Mogo’s software analyzes borrowers instantly and greatly reduces the traditionally cumbersome underwriting process for loans. It’s online only, so there’s very low overhead and a ton of cash to spend on marketing. Labeled as “the Uber of finance” by CNBC, Mogo is definitely turning heads.

With increasing membership growth and revenue lines continuing to improve, and a platform which many banks have failed to offer, Mogo could well become an acquisition target in the near future.

60,2021-02-22T10:32:05+00:00,"Alibaba, Pinduoduo Fight Against China’s Looming Food Crisis","(Bloomberg) -- The battle to supply 1.4 billion people with fresh fruit and vegetables is taking China’s e-commerce companies into the country’s hinterlands, where they are attempting to revolutionize centuries-old agricultural practices to secure future supply for their burgeoning online grocery businesses.

Xi Jinping’s government has long made self-sufficiency in food a “top state issue” as it seeks to avert a looming food crisis. The need to modernize China’s 200 million largely small-scale farms took on added urgency during the pandemic, when output and logistics disruptions coincided with homebound shoppers turning to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other internet retailers for their produce.

Now, some of the country’s largest private companies have joined in with state efforts to help growers boost production, improve food quality and lower prices. For the e-commerce giants, it’s one way of strengthening their foothold in an online grocery market that’s expected to be worth more than $120 billion by 2023, without running afoul of Beijing’s recent crackdown on monopolistic practices like predatory pricing and forced exclusivity arrangements.

In Fujian along the eastern coast, Alibaba has provided chicken farmers with smart bracelets that track the health of their poultry, while under JD.com Inc.’s guidance, rice growers in China’s arid north have installed smart sensors to gain real-time insights for irrigation. Out west, scientists in Yunnan are teaming up with Pinduoduo Inc. to use artificial intelligence to automate strawberry planting.

“Agriculture is a critical area supported by the Chinese government,” said Liu Yue, an analyst with market research firm EqualOcean. With rural youths flocking to cities for better jobs and food safety increasingly threatened by pesticides and outdated farming methods, the country’s tech champions are eager to lend Beijing a hand, she said.

The driving force behind the e-commerce platforms’ push into smart agriculture is the boom in online groceries, which is expected to double to about 820 billion yuan ($127 billion) by 2023 from last year, according to iResearch. The category overtook consumer electronics as the biggest contributor at JD.com in the first half last year, while Alibaba is making a bigger push into the business by taking a larger stake in hypermart Sun Art Retail Group Ltd.

Meanwhile, a clutch of smaller rivals ranging from Xingsheng Youxuan and MissFresh-- both backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- to Dingdong Maicai are in the process of raising billions of dollars to grab larger shares of the online fresh foods distribution market. That prompted state media to warn in December against overcrowding in the sector, saying instead that internet giants with immense data and advance algorithms should do more in technology innovation.

“Covid-19 has helped accelerate the conversion of such purchases to online channels,” said Vey-Sern Ling, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a large untapped market, and the companies have to participate or be left behind.”

At a time when Chinese leaders are clamping down on monopolies in areas from fintech to e-commerce, smart agriculture is one sphere where the tech giants’ commercial interests are aligned with the national agenda.

In guidelines issued on Sunday, the State Council called for increased private investment to develop modern farming techniques and empower villages using advanced technologies. Breeding and cultivation sciences were also listed as one of Beijing’s top tech priorities for the next five years, alongside AI, quantum computing and computer chips. JD has said its smart farm projects are at least 50% funded by government subsidies.

Despite the efforts, the growing appetite for fresh fruits and vegetables has left most of China’s traditionally labor-intensive farms -- roughly 98% of the 200 million operators are families or small businesses -- struggling to keep up. The country’s restrictions on land ownership and diverse terrain spanning the steppes of Inner Mongolia to the tropical shores of Hainan island in the south make it difficult to implement the industrial-scale farming that’s commonly seen in the U.S. and Europe. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also show that about a third of farm workers are aged 55 or older, and the birthrate is at record lows, driving labor costs higher.

Lei Jinrong is one farmer who’s benefited from partnering with the online retailers. The owner of Fuxin Farm in Fujian province has equipped 1,000 of his chickens with Apple Watch-style bracelets supplied by Alibaba. The devices digitally track the number of steps the birds take each day and anything below 20,000 would be an early sign of illness, he said, adding that he no longer needs to patrol his fields in search of sick poultry.

The grower has also deployed street lamp-like devices that monitor air temperature, humidity and the level of toxic ammonia gas generated from bird waste, all displayed in real-time on a computer screen at his office. That has enabled Lei to expand production without hiring more workers -- good news as average salaries in his village have almost quadrupled over the past decade.

In the eastern province of Shandong, peach farmers increased revenue by 50% last year after using JD’s blockchain technology to encrypt each step of the planting process and increase trust and transparency, attracting consumers long weary of food scandals from tainted milk powder to imitation eggs.

“The improved efficiency and the economies of scale will drive down costs while higher-quality produce will yield better prices,” said Charlie Chen, head of consumer research at China Renaissance in Hong Kong. This will benefit both farmers and the e-commerce operators, he said.

Pinduoduo, which raised $6.1 billion in November in part to finance its agricultural innovations, is counting on these efforts to help it quadruple sales of farm products to 1 trillion yuan by 2025. The company expects the initiatives to help it diversify beyond online retail, as it aims to license cutting-edge farming technology down the road, according to David Liu, vice president of strategy.

Many of these initiatives are still in their infancy and scaling up will take time, as farmers have only recently started to collect data -- the foundation of running AI and other next-generation technologies -- and test new methods of growing. But the twin drivers of surging demand for online produce and Beijing’s push for self-sufficiency in food supplies means the tech behemoths’ forays into modernizing China’s farms have only just begun.

“Smart agriculture is really the way to move forward,” said Lei, the chicken farmer. “We all have to innovate.”

You can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.

Insider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.

Almost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.

Warren Buffett

We have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.

Since hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the ""best stocks to buy for beginner investors"". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.

Overall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Below we listed the 15 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of December 2020. We believe these are the 15 best stocks a beginner investor can buy today:

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA): $338.46

Number of Hedge Funds: 154 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 133 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $18 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.4% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -5.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 10 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 7 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Akre Capital Management, Berkshire Hathaway Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, express

7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA): $264.51

Number of Hedge Funds: 156 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 166 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $17.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 13.7% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 4 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 5 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Ken Fisher

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

6. Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG): $2,117.20

Number of Hedge Funds: 157 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $20.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.7% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 20.9% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 7 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 8 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Boykin Curry

You can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.

Insider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.

Almost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.

Warren Buffett

We have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.

Since hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the ""best stocks to buy for beginner investors"". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.

Overall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Below we listed the 15 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of December 2020. We believe these are the 15 best stocks a beginner investor can buy today:

11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS): $183

Number of Hedge Funds: 144 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 112 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $16.42 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.2% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 1.0% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 14 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 18 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA): $338.46

Number of Hedge Funds: 154 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 133 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $18 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.4% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -5.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 10 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 7 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Akre Capital Management, Berkshire Hathaway Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, express

7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA): $264.51

Number of Hedge Funds: 156 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 166 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $17.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 13.7% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 4 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 5 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Ken Fisher

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

6. Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG): $2,117.20

Number of Hedge Funds: 157 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $20.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.7% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 20.9% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 7 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 8 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Boykin Curry

This has widespread implications, because — as we noted earlier this month — Apple won’t build the Apple Car by itself. The company will use outside vendors to supply critical hardware for the Apple Car. We believe one such vendor could be LiDAR maker Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR), and that is one of the reasons we’ve been so bullish on LAZR stock. Luminar (LAZR) sign with greenery around it

Source: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com

On Friday, Feb. 19, Bloomberg all but confirmed that is the case.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Apple is, indeed, in talks with LiDAR makers to include their sensors in the Apple Car. The report implied that Apple has yet to decide on a specific LiDAR maker and is continuing to have discussions with various suppliers.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

There is a high probability that, when all is said and done, Luminar will be company that Apple settles on — and therefore, “Apple Car supplier” is very likely in Luminar’s future.

Undoubtedly, the Apple Car will be a big hit. That’s a big reason to buy LAZR stock.

I’m Revealing the Next Amazon Stock for FREE on Tuesday, Feb. 23 — Join Me Here!

Here’s a deeper look.

Luminar Is the Best LiDAR Maker

When Apple builds something, they make it a very high-quality product, with the highest-quality components. So, when it comes to the Apple Car, Apple will likely pick the best LiDAR in the market.

Who makes the best LiDAR in the world?

Luminar.

Relative to other LiDAR sensors, Luminar’s LiDAR have the:

Longest range, at over 250 meters of visibility at 5% reflectivity. Best resolution, with over 300 points per square degree at 10 Hertz. Best performance in adverse weather. Least interference from other LiDAR and/or sunlight.

It’s the best long-range LiDAR on the planet. It just happens to be the lowest-cost LiDAR, too, as Luminar is the only LiDAR maker in the world that is able to integrate its LiDAR sensors in a vehicle for under $1,000.

Story continues

There really is no competition here. Luminar is the best LiDAR maker in the world.

Apple won’t partner with the second-best for the Apple Car. They’ll pick the best. And the best is Luminar. That’s a big positive for LAZR stock.

Apple Car Will Be a Hit

Luminar winning an Apple Car supplier partnership would be big for two reasons.

One, the Apple Car will be a hit.

Apple is Apple. This is the company behind the world’s most popular consumer hardware products, like the iPhone, Mac, iPad and Apple Watch. This is a company with nearly $200 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and about 150,000 highly-qualified employees…

Now, this company – with the most experience in the world, the most money in the world, and the most engineering and design talent in the world – is going to make a car.

This Apple Car has the potential to be truly disruptive… and turn into an enormous hit like the iPhone.

Two, the partnership will be a huge vote of confidence from the world’s largest technology company. Other auto OEMs will take note. Luminar should be able to leverage this partnership win to sign-on multiple other auto OEMs over the next few years.

To that end, Luminar winning the Apple Car contract could be the beginning of an avalanche of new contracts for the LiDAR maker. As all those contracts roll in, LAZR stock will keep pushing higher.

Bottom Line on LAZR Stock

The self-driving revolution has arrived. One of the best ways to play this revolution is by buying perception technology companies. The most important component of the self-driving hardware perception stack is LiDAR, and the best LiDAR maker in the world is Luminar.

On that basis alone, LAZR stock is a great long-term investment. The Apple Car catalyst just adds more firepower to the bull thesis.

But it’s not the best growth stock to buy today.

Instead, the best growth stock to buy today is a company which reminds me of a young Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent.

71,2021-02-19T16:36:45+00:00,"Apple in Talks to Buy Self-Driving Sensors, Key Step in Car Plan","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is in discussions with multiple suppliers of self-driving car sensors known as lidar, according to people familiar with the matter, a key milestone toward development of its first passenger vehicle.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is in active talks with a number of potential suppliers for these laser-based sensors that allow a car’s computer to “see” its surroundings, said the people, who asked not to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions. The company has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years and has developed on its own most of the necessary software, underlying processors and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for such a sophisticated system.

As it’s done with the iPhone, Apple is looking to outside vendors to supply critical hardware for a planned autonomous vehicle, the people said. The ongoing discussions are a sign that Apple has yet to settle on a preferred supplier for lidar and that it’s likely mulling a range of options, including a heavily customized version of the sensors, as it moves toward developing a car design. That’s an indication that a finished product is still several years away.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment.

At least a half-dozen lidar companies have gone public via reverse merger in recent months -- raising hundreds of millions of dollars by seizing on investor appetite for a bet on future demand for high-tech cars. The laser sensor technology is used by many top-tier players hoping to commercialize driverless vehicles, including Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo unit and General Motors Co.’s Cruise division.

Shares of lidar makers jumped on Bloomberg’s report. Luminar Technologies Inc. rose as much as 8.9% to $35.75, reversing earlier declines. Velodyne Lidar Inc. climbed as much as 4.7% to $21.89. Apple shares rose 0.8% to $130.71 at 11:03 a.m. New York time.

Story continues

Benjamin Lyon, a key Apple manager who oversaw work on self-driving car hardware, left the company earlier this week for a space and satellite startup. It’s unclear what impact that may have on Apple’s progress on delivering a commercially viable car.

Off-the-Shelf

Apple has been testing its robotaxi technology on public roads in California since 2017. The first version of its test cars, modified Lexus SUVs, used a lidar stack made up of off-the-shelf parts, though this has become a more bespoke effort recently.

The company explained in a white paper issued in 2019 how its sensory perception technology is supposed to work. “The sensing component is able to determine where the vehicle is located in the world and can identify and track surrounding objects, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists,” Apple said at the time. “This is accomplished using a combination of sensors, including lidar, radar, and cameras, and provides high-resolution 360-degree 3D coverage around the vehicle.”

Reuters reported in 2019 that Apple was talking to lidar makers, but the autonomous vehicle project was fully rebooted afterward. Apple is now in discussions for next-generation lidar that will be considered cutting edge four to five years from now -- another indicator of the company’s timeline, said people familiar with the discussions.

Cars aren’t Apple’s only foray into lidar: The company launched an iPad Pro embedded with the laser sensor tech last March, and it expanded the feature to the iPhone 12 Pro line last fall. The technology enhances low-light photography and augmented reality applications in the consumer devices; using it to detect driving conditions and obstacles in the road is a more complicated feat.

Five-Year Timeline

The iPhone maker has a team of car interior, body, drivetrain and battery experts working toward eventually launching a car. Inside the company, staff believe that such a launch is at least five years away, Bloomberg News has reported.

Apple’s self-driving car system has improved from a few years ago, but is still lagging the competition. Last year, Apple test cars drove more than 18,800 miles in California with a human driver having to take control every 145 miles. That compares to Waymo, which drove 628,839 miles and needed a human driver to take over every 30,000 or so miles, and Cruise, which drove 770,000 total miles with a disengagement every 28,520 miles.

Even as Apple seeks suppliers, it also is in talks about potential manufacturing and other outsourcing partnership deals with several different automakers. It has discussed car manufacturing options with Hyundai group sister companies Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp., but those discussions paused several weeks ago. The two carmakers recently said they are not in talks with Apple.

What Happened: The tech giant would most likely turn to one of its existing suppliers in India for assembling iPads in the country as early as this year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The Tim Cook-led company is said to be in the process of diversifying production to India and Vietnam in order to avoid the fallout of the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.

Apple’s existing contractors in India include Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) — better known as Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron — all Taiwanese companies.

Why It Matters: Existing iPad assembler BYD Electronic International, a subsidiary of BYD Company Ltd (OTC: BYDDY), faces barriers to entry in India, amid the country’s wariness on Chinese firms, noted Reuters.

India has a $6.7 billion plan to bump exports of smartphones. The government is also planning a performance-linked incentive that will offer cashback to manufacturers for exports and has a budget of INR 70 billion ($964.5 million) over a five-year period.

The scheme is expected to be launched at the end of this month but Apple and others are lobbying for a bigger budgetary allocation of INR 200 billion ($2.75 billion), reported Reuters.

For example, job seekers can now see and compare how Black employees at a company rate their company’s culture or career opportunities compared to white employees at that company, according to Glassdoor.

""We try to adjust and adapt Glassdoor's product over the years to the needs in the hiring marketplace. That's our business, to help people find jobs and companies that they love,"" said Glassdoor Chief Economist Dr. Andrew Chamberlain. He tells Yahoo Finance that the change in how the site breaks down job data has been years in the making.

""The needs of employers as they try to hire are really different today. Diversity, equity, and inclusion [DEI] are not just a fad that is coming and will disappear. It's not just a fad that showed up and will disappear again. It's here to stay. It's something that job seekers want to see. Real diversity, equity, and inclusion results by employers and employers want intelligence about how they are actually doing, and how their D&I goals are being realized and compared to their competitors."" Glassdoor website —Glassdoor

Glassdoor has collected approximately 800,000 demographic insights from 187,000 employees at more than 3,300 companies. Data shows that Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), AT&T (T), and Starbucks (SBUX) are among the companies with the most demographic information shared by employees.

The job site has spent the last few months gathering data on the Black experience at work. Its preliminary findings show that Black employees were less satisfied on average at their jobs, with a 3.3 rating compared to the 3.5 rating overall. However, Chamberlain tells Yahoo Finance that the ratings depend greatly on the company and industry.

Story continues

""There is no one universal Black experience at work. It really depends on company policies. And it depends on the local culture inside organizations. So we found even within the same industry, there are very big differences between how satisfied people are at work.""

Glassdoor says that it had sufficient data on 20 companies when it came to measuring the Black work experience, and the research showed that Apple has the highest overall rating among Black employees, which stands at a 4.2. Here's how the rest of the top 5 broke down: Bank of America (4.0), Capital One (3.9), Starbucks (3.9), J.P. Morgan (3.8).

“Whether you’re East Asian or South Asian, White, Black or LatinX, you’re coming into a workplace with really different cultural norms and experiences, and the insight of the diversity equity inclusion movement is that employers can do better ... if they let people be themselves at work and try to find ways to build a culture that’s inclusive and let's everyone be the most productive they can be and flourish at work and bring that cultural background with them rather than trying to force everybody into a monoculture where everybody has to talk the same and dress the same and do the same things, that’s the direction smart employers are headed and that’s what this product is designed to help them do.”

86,2021-02-18T11:00:00+00:00,Apple Hiring Engineers to Develop 6G Wireless,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. launched its first iPhones with 5G wireless speeds a few months ago. Now it’s looking to start work on sixth-generation cellular connectivity, or 6G, indicating it wants to be a leader in the technology rather than relying on other companies.

The Cupertino, California-based company this week posted job ads seeking wireless system research engineers for current and next-generation networks. The listings are for positions at Apple’s offices in Silicon Valley and San Diego, where the company works on wireless technology development and chip design.

“You will have the unique and rewarding opportunity to craft next generation wireless technology that will have deep impact on future Apple products,“ according to the job announcement. “In this role you will be at the center of a cutting-edge research group responsible for creating next generation disruptive radio access technologies over the next decade.”

People hired for the positions will “research and design next generation (6G) wireless communication systems for radio access networks” and “participate in industry/academic forums passionate about 6G technology.” Industry watchers don’t expect 6G to roll out until about 2030, but the job listings indicate Apple wants to be involved at the earliest stages in the development of the new technology. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.

Apple’s current swath of iPhones use 5G modems designed by Qualcomm Inc. While the company launched its first 5G devices at an opportune time, several phone makers beat it to market and Apple relied heavily on Qualcomm for connection to the new wireless network, which dramatically improves the amount and speed of data that consumers can download. In order to get 5G into the latest iPhones, Apple settled a contentious lawsuit with the San Diego-based chipmaker. Apple’s early involvement in 6G research and design indicates it won’t wait around for the next major advancement.

Story continues

Late last year, Apple joined an alliance of companies working on standards for 6G and other next-generation cellular technologies. The standards and timing for 6G are still loosely defined, but some analysts say the technology could enable speeds more than 100 times faster than 5G.

The job listings are another signal of Apple’s continued push into developing more technology in-house. The company has designed main processors for the iPhone and iPad and last year expanded that effort to the Mac. It has also ramped up work on its own custom screens and camera technologies, in addition to wireless chips for AirPods, Apple Watch and precise location data.

Apple last year started developing its first custom modem, the chip that allows phones to connect to wireless networks. In a town hall meeting with employees in December, Johny Srouji, Apple’s custom technology and chip head, said that “long-term strategic investments like these are a critical part of enabling our products and making sure we have a rich pipeline of innovative technologies for our future.”

Though Apple is laying the groundwork to be a key player in 6G, it has much work ahead to take full advantage of 5G, a technology in its infancy. The company hasn’t expanded 5G to other devices like the Apple Watch and iPad, and it sells multiple iPhones that use older 4G technology. It’s likely that Apple’s first modem will be for 5G connectivity.

88,2021-02-18T08:37:38+00:00,Warren Buffett’s Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article, we discussed Warren Buffett's hedge fund Berkshire Hathaway's adjustments in the 13F portfolio and examined its top 10 stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of the Oracle of Omaha's investment strategy and returns and go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Stock Picks.

The world’s most renowned stock market investor Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway has made several changes in its 13F securities portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2020 to adjust its positions according to the changing market trends.

The latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that Buffett’s Berkshire securities portfolio continues trimming its financial stock positions. The firm, which ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with a 45% stake in the finance sector, is no longer a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and PNC (NYSE: PNC) at the beginning of 2021. Berkshire Hathaway has also significantly trimmed its stake in Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and US Bancorp during the fourth quarter of 2020 but kept its positions in Bank of New York (NYSE: BK), Bank of America, and American Express. Financial stocks now represent 19% of overall Berkshire’s $260 billion 13F portfolio, according to the fourth quarter filings. Early in 2020, Berkshire Hathaway sold its entire stake in airline companies. Best Insurance Stocks To Buy Now

On the other hand, Warren Buffett’s investment firm found buying opportunities in only a few stocks including Chevron and Verizon communications. We will discuss these two stock picks later in the article because both are now standing in the top ten list of Buffett’s portfolio.

Warren Buffett's hedge fund has made several other key changes in its portfolio to beat the market trends in 2021. His firm sold all of its stake in Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Barrick Gold (NYSE: GOLD). Meanwhile, the company has added to its 6 existing positions including AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), and Merck (NYSE: MRK). The firm bought these three pharma stocks during the third quarter of of 2020.

It appears that Oracle of Omaha has been shifting investments towards health care, consumer staples, and the information technology sectors. Healthcare sector weightage increased from 1.47% at the end of 2019 to 4.09% of the portfolio at the end of 2020. Information technology holds 48% of the overall portfolio despite selling over 6% of Apple’s stake in the latest quarter.

While Warren Buffett's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter's stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 111 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let start reviewing Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s top 10 stock picks for 2021 to see whether these stocks have the potential to offer hefty returns and outperform the market trends. The top 10 holdings account for 85% of Buffett’s 13F portfolio.

10. DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA)

The healthcare services provider DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) is the tenth-largest stock holding of Warren Buffett’s portfolio, according to the latest 13F filings. The firm has benefited from DaVita’s share price surge in 2020 but shares of DVA are down 11% since the beginning of this year. The latest selloff is the outcome of lower-than-expected results for the December quarter. The company generated $2.91 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, down $20 million from the Wall Street consensus estimate.

Despite weak fourth-quarter results, its 2020 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 38% to $6.39. Moreover, the company expects earnings from continuing operations of up to $8.75 per share for 2021.

9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)

Warren Buffett has created a huge position in Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the massive growth in oil prices. It appears that the stock-picking strategy worked in the case of Chevron. This is because shares of the oil and gas giant rallied more than 9.5% compared to the S&P 500 growth of just over 4%. Moreover, Chevron has the ability to offer increasing cash returns to shareholders. The company currently offers a dividend yield of 5.5%.

Diamond Hill Capital also stated in an investor letter that Chevron Corporation is an attractive pick for long-term investors. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital said:

“Integrated oil and gas company Chevron Corp. shares meaningfully declined during the quarter as OPEC+ failed to reach a deal, allowing us to establish a position in this lower risk, more diversified company at a sufficient discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.”

8. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB)

Shares of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) bounced back strongly in the past two quarters after experiencing a historic selloff early in 2020. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, according to the latest filings. The firm has sold a small U.S. Bancorp stake during the fourth quarter.

Shares of USB are up 4.4% so far in 2021 but are still down 11% in the last twelve months. On the positive side, Berkshire has been collecting big dividends from USB over the years. Its dividend yield currently stands around 3.4%. U.S. Bancorp is among the few banks that have generated positive earnings growth in the December quarter, thanks to strong growth in non-interest income. Its fourth-quarter earnings per share of 95 cents increased from 90 cents in the same period last year.

7. Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO)

Berkshire Hathaway made no changes to its stake in Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) during the fourth quarter. It represents the seventh-largest stock holding of Buffett’s securities portfolio. Moody's share price underperformed in 2020 and extended the sluggish performance since the beginning of this year. The credit ratings and assessment services company offers a dividend yield just below 1%.

Moody’s December quarter revenue of $1.29 billion increased close to 5% and topped the analysts’ consensus estimate by $70 million. Moreover, its FY 2020 diluted earnings per share increased 27% year over year to $9.39. The company anticipates FY 2021 diluted EPS of $9.70 to $10.10, while adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $10.30 to $10.70.

6. Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ)

Warren Buffett has created a big position in Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) during the fourth quarter, accounting for 3.19% of the overall portfolio. Shares of Verizon underperformed in the last twelve months and extended the downtrend since the beginning of this year. However, the company offers a dividend yield of 4.64%.

Mott Capital Management, an investment management firm, continues showing confidence in Verizon Communications despite sluggish financial performance. Here is what Mott Capital Management stated in an investors' letter.

“Verizon finished the year lower by around 4.3% and has been a hard holding over the past 6 years. It has gone nowhere and has been the one stock I struggle with. However, 5G has finally arrived. If 5G can deliver on the promise I think it can, then Verizon should eventually come around. I remain hopeful.”

89,2021-02-18T08:07:47+00:00,Apple lobbies for India incentives as it plans iPad assembly: sources,"By Sankalp Phartiyal

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc is angling to participate in a new scheme to boost India's exports of computer products, part of what government and industry sources say are plans to bring iPad tablet manufacturing to the South Asian country.

India launched a $6.7 billion plan to boost smartphone exports last year, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up efforts to promote electronics manufacturing and create jobs.

Apple, which has steadily raised production of iPhones in India to lessen its dependence on Chinese manufacturing, took part in that scheme via its contract manufacturers.

Now the government is preparing to unveil another incentive to drive local manufacturing of IT products including tablets, laptops and servers, three sources closely involved in the drafting of the plan told Reuters.

The new performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which offers cash-back to manufacturers for exports, will have a budget of up to 70 billion rupees ($964.5 million) over five years, the sources said. It's expected to be launched by the end of February.

Apple, along with others, is lobbying for a bigger budgetary outlay of 200 billion rupees before that plan is finalised, as India doesn't yet have the scale or the supply chain for making IT products and competes with duty-free imports of tech products, two of the sources said.

Apple's push comes at a time its iPhone supplier Wistron is just restarting operations at a southern Indian plant after angry workers went on a rampage last year. Apple is yet to take the Taiwan manufacturer off of probation.

Apple declined to comment for this story.

New Delhi is also planning another PLI, at a budget of roughly 50 billion rupees over five years, to boost domestic manufacturing of wearable devices such as smartwatches, the sources said, adding the plan could be announced within two months.

All the sources declined to be named as the plans are not public.

INDIA-MADE IPAD

Story continues

Apple assembles a bulk of its iPads in China, but is fast diversifying production to markets such as India and Vietnam to minimise the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus crisis.

Its top supplier Foxconn is building assembly lines for iPads and MacBook laptops in Vietnam, Reuters reported late last year. Other iPad assemblers include Taiwan's Compal Electronics and China's BYD Electronic International.

In India, Apple will likely have iPad's assembled by one of its existing suppliers in the country as early as this year, two of the sources said, though its plans could get delayed as India makes the entry of BYD difficult amid its wariness to give new tech business to Chinese companies.

""The government is asking Apple to get iPads assembled by its contract manufacturers here, the non-Chinese companies"" one of the sources, a government official said.

It was not immediately clear which of Apple's three contractors in India - Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron - would assemble iPads.

Pegatron and Wistron did not respond to requests for comment while Foxconn said it does not comment on specific operations or work for a customer.

India's IT ministry also did not respond to a request for comment.

India last year banned more than 200 Chinese-origin mobile applications, saying they threatened the security of the country. It also announced new controls on telecoms gear purchases.

Cupertino, California-based Apple began the assembly of iPhones in India in 2017 and has since ramped up manufacturing operations via the local units of Foxconn and Wistron. Pegatron also set up a base in India last year.

Foxconn will invest up to $1 billion to expand a factory in southern India where the Taiwanese contract manufacturer assembles iPhones, Reuters reported previously.

The three Apple suppliers have also committed roughly $900 million over five years to make iPhones in India.

91,2021-02-18T07:12:27+00:00,"Biden Team Pressing Taiwan, Allies on Auto Chip Shortfall","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser, Brian Deese, has sought the Taiwanese government’s help resolving a global semiconductor shortage that’s idling U.S. car manufacturing plants, according to a letter reviewed by Bloomberg News.

In the letter, Deese thanked Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, Wang Mei-hua, for her personal engagement on the microchips shortage and relayed concerns from U.S. automotive companies.

Deese’s letter shows that top White House officials have become involved in trying to resolve the shortage, which has presented an early challenge to Biden’s administration. Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are both personally engaged in the effort to address bottlenecks in auto companies’ supply chains, a White House spokesperson said.

The spokesperson asked not to be identified by name because the talks have been private. Wang told reporters Thursday that she hasn’t received a letter from Deese and reiterated that Taiwan’s chipmakers are trying to resolve the supply constraints.

The administration is engaging with international partners and allies to encourage them to take steps to address the shortage, but all sides recognize it’s not a short-term crisis, the White House spokesperson said. More will have to be done to prevent similar shortages in the future, the spokesperson added.

The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTake

Taiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views the island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence.

The Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson said.

Story continues

‘Reasonable’ Asks

The formal outreach to Taiwan follows meetings between Deese and Sullivan and U.S. auto companies and their suppliers. The auto industry is leaning on the White House to pressure foreign chipmakers and their governments to allocate supplies to the U.S.

“We think those are reasonable things for the government to ask,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies for Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles). “This is going to be a problem for the first half of the year.”

Administration officials in the State and Commerce departments have previously sought meetings with Taiwanese government and industry officials to press them to ramp up the supply of semiconductors.

Thousands of American autoworkers could face cuts to their hours and wages as plants halt production while awaiting new shipments of automotive-grade semiconductors from Taiwan and South Korea -- chips that won’t even be manufactured for three to four months. Companies have provided the White House with the job impact data, people familiar with the matter said.

That prospect threatens to undermine Biden’s efforts to energize a sputtering economic recovery, hitting hardest in political battleground Michigan, as well as Texas and Kentucky.

IHS Markit estimated this week that nearly 1 million fewer light vehicles will be produced in the first quarter of 2021 because of the semiconductor shortage. The projection was a revision of an earlier estimate of 672,000 fewer cars coming off production lines in the first quarter that was issued by the group on Jan. 29.

The chip shortage first hit the auto industry in December, coinciding with a tumultuous transition of power, an impeachment trial, the ongoing pandemic and the urgent push for an economic stimulus. By the time Biden was sworn in, former President Donald Trump’s administration had only made preliminary efforts to fix the problem.

Senior Biden administration officials have identified semiconductors as one of the strategic areas for domestic investment to compete with China and ensure the U.S. is no longer dependent on other countries. Biden plans to sign an executive order in the coming weeks to demand a review of supply chains, though no imminent action is expected to result from it.

Taiwan Dependence

Leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy of Taiwan, which is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly due to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

Taiwan’s role in the global economy was largely below the radar before the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.

But there’s a question about how effective cooperation can be in a time when every allied country wants to move away from its dependence on China and build their own capacity at home.

U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.

Exacerbating the U.S. shortages, power failures caused by brutally cold weather in Texas have shuttered semiconductor plants clustered around Austin.NXP Semiconductor NV, one of the largest makers of chips used by auto companies, has idled two plants in the Austin area, the company said early Wednesday. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second largest semiconductor maker, also closed down production at its Austin site, the South Korean company said. Infineon Technologies AG, another large supplier of chips to the automotive industry, said its Austin plant has been shut down because the power was turned off.

How a global chip shortage is disrupting multiple industries — and how to fix it

The pandemic has created a global semiconductor shortage that’s disrupted industries ranging from cars to consumer electronics. The easy fix, you’d think, is for manufacturers to build more processors. But the problem is more complex than pumping out more chips.

The unprecedented semiconductor shortage stems from three issues: a slowdown and then rapid recovery in automotive sales, a massive uptick in the demand for consumer electronics, and the long lead times in chip production. That’s led to industries around the world fighting for a limited supply of semiconductors. And auto makers have to fight even harder for chips than tech giants, which tend to be chipmakers' more valued customers.

“Right now [automakers] are competing in the supply base with phones, and notebook computers,” Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School, told Yahoo Finance. “Apple (AAPL) will sell more iPhones, in the first three months of this year than all the automakers combined will sell vehicles in the whole year. So then if you're a semiconductor maker who's the more important customer?”

A change to supply chain and U.S plants

The chip shortage highlights the single weakest link in the complex automotive global supply chain: it focuses more on getting the lowest price for goods rather than resilience and flexibility. But that’s going to have to change.

“Efficiencies always dominated,” Morris Cohen, Wharton Business School professor of manufacturing and logistics, said. “Now because of COVID, a lot of companies have said ‘You know, we put too much weight on that. You should put more weight on resilience and flexibility.’ And that will, of course, promote bringing manufacturing back [to the U.S.].”

While the U.S. was once the epicenter of chip production, other nations, using generous incentives, have lured chipmakers to their shores. The result: The U.S. produces about 12% of the global semiconductor output. That’s still good enough to make chips the country’s fifth largest export, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). But that presence alone couldn’t stave off the current shortage.

“A lot of people...are pointing to these shortages of automotive chips as just harbingers that we don't have control of the supply chain,” Shih said.

It goes beyond the lack of available chip supply. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Samsung now produce some of the most advanced chips in the world, and while they have plants in the U.S., neither is an American firm. And while Intel (INTC) is still one of the premiere chipmakers in the world, it’s been losing ground for years.

To address the chip shortage, a bipartisan coalition of Congressional lawmakers want to pump billions of dollars into drawing chip manufacturing back to the U.S. They're also seeking to fund research and development of more advanced processors through the CHIPS for America Act.

“This legislation would help stimulate advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities domestically, secure the supply chain, and ensure [the] U.S. maintains our lead in [chip] design while creating jobs, lowering our reliance on other countries for advanced chip fabrication, and strengthening national security,” Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said in a statement after the bill was introduced this summer.

Automotive and consumer brawling over chips

The chip shortage began at the start of the pandemic, when automakers around the world predicted sales would collapse as consumers locked down. In turn, manufacturers slowed purchases of components including chips.

But demand for autos began to recover far faster than anticipated. According to the SIA, while year-over-year automotive semiconductor sales fell off a cliff in March 2020 and April 2020 as the pandemic took off, they quickly recovered in Q3 and surpassed 2019 sales in Q4.

Automakers famously keep their supply chains lean by limiting the number of parts on hand. That means vehicle manufacturers had little chip inventory, and an immediate need to restock. But they quickly found themselves competing for resources with consumer tech companies, which were seeing a surge in demand of their own.

“As the auto and industrial markets began to rebound in the second half of the year, the available foundry capacity was largely sold out,” Kurt Sievers, CEO of chipmaker NXP, said during NXP’s Q4 earnings call. “As a result, we and others are experiencing significant increases in lead times, and in certain cases, increased cost from suppliers.”

What’s more, according to Morris Cohen, automakers each use customized chips for their vehicles. That means vehicle manufacturers can’t easily swap them, shrinking the available supply of chips.

Semiconductor production isn’t exactly fast, either. According to SIA, producing a processor can take three to four months depending on the chip, with more advanced semiconductors taking a whopping six months.

In other words, even as automakers begin to gain access to chip manufacturing capacity, they’ll still have to wait months for those processors to be built let alone put into a car or truck.

‘It’s going to take time’

For now, automakers will have to contend with idling factories, and leaving thousands without work, until they can access more chips. Moving forward, if they want to avoid a repeat of these shortages, they’ll need to rethink the current supply chain by building up stock of chips for their vehicles rather than running with such lean inventories.

It will take a lot longer for the U.S. to make any broader changes to its chip manufacturing capabilities. While legislators may support such a move, plants cost billions of dollars and take years to build. But as the massive shortages show, something eventually has got to give.

“I think it's just going to take time,” Cohen said. “I think we're gonna put more weight on having resilience, having national security, having the ability to make things closer to where they're demanded. But at the end of the day you have to trade that off against the efficiency of producing it wherever you can.”

How a global chip shortage is disrupting multiple industries — and how to fix it

The pandemic has created a global semiconductor shortage that’s disrupted industries ranging from cars to consumer electronics. The easy fix, you’d think, is for manufacturers to build more processors. But the problem is more complex than pumping out more chips.

The unprecedented semiconductor shortage stems from three issues: a slowdown and then rapid recovery in automotive sales, a massive uptick in the demand for consumer electronics, and the long lead times in chip production. That’s led to industries around the world fighting for a limited supply of semiconductors. And auto makers have to fight even harder for chips than tech giants, which tend to be chipmakers' more valued customers.

“Right now [automakers] are competing in the supply base with phones, and notebook computers,” Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School, told Yahoo Finance. “Apple (AAPL) will sell more iPhones, in the first three months of this year than all the automakers combined will sell vehicles in the whole year. So then if you're a semiconductor maker who's the more important customer?”

94,2021-02-17T19:03:17+00:00,"Texas Power Failures Shut Chip Factories, Squeezing Tight Supply","(Bloomberg) -- Power outages across Texas caused by historically cold weather have shut down semiconductor plants clustered around Austin, further disrupting a supply chain that has already been falling short of customer needs.NXP Semiconductor NV, one of the largest makers of chips used by automakers, has idled two plants in the Austin area, the company said early Wednesday. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second largest semiconductor maker, also closed down production at its Austin site, the South Korean company said. Infineon Technologies AG, another large supplier of chips to the automotive industry, said its Austin plant has been shut down because the power was turned off.Carmakers around the world have slowed production because they can’t get enough supply of electronic components. Other electronics makers, including Apple Inc., have said their growth has been constrained by the lack of parts as demand rebounded faster than many expected from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic economic slump.The Austin area is home to several plants and other facilities of major chipmakers. Unprecedented cold winter weather and a surge in electricity demand has crippled the Texas utility grid, forcing factory shutdowns, store closings and leaving more than 3 million homes without power.

Chip plants typically run 24 hours a day to enable them to be economically viable. The complex photolithographic process used to make semiconductors can’t usually be stopped suddenly without damaging at least some of the work in progress. Samsung and NXP said they are assessing the situation and will resume production as soon as power is restored.

Samsung said Tuesday that it received prior notice of the shutdown and was able to take appropriate measures to protect the equipment and wafers in production. NXP said it will be able to evaluate the impact when full production resumes. The Netherlands-based company said all of its other manufacturing facilities outside Texas remain in full operation.

Story continues

Austin is home to two of NXP’s five internal chip plants. The company handles half of its own silicon wafer processing and outsources the balance.

“It’s very early in the process, and we are dealing with a real-time situation,” Jacey Zuniga, an NXP spokesperson, said Wednesday. “Once necessary utility services are restored, our ops team will be able to evaluate when full production will resume.”

NXP shares fell 2.4% to $190.69 at 1:15 p.m. in New York, in line with a general decline by semiconductor companies. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index declined about 2%. Shares of Samsung dropped 2% to 83,200 won at the close Wednesday in South Korea.

Like Samsung, German chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG said it received advanced notice of the power cut, which helped to minimize the impact.

“This gave us a few hours to prepare for the disruption and we were able to put the factory into a safe state and to protect our employees and production inventory,” Infineon said Wednesday in a statement. “We are still assessing the impact and are informing any affected customers as quickly as possible.”

Samsung, which locates most of its production in its home base of South Korea, has a logic semiconductor plant in Austin that makes chips on a contract basis for other companies. It’s unlikely that the plant makes chips for high-profile customers such as Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. because the factory is one of Samsung older facilities, according to a report by Chris Caso, an analyst at Raymond James.

For NXP, the outage may have a more significant influence on industry dynamics, he said.“Under normal circumstances we would expect this to have only a minimal impact, but given the significant shortages occurring throughout the industry, and in NXP’s primary automotive market in particular, such an outage will only serve to exacerbate those shortages,” Caso wrote.

96,2021-02-17T18:10:04+00:00,Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs In The World,"In this article, we are going to list the Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World. Click to skip ahead and jump to the Top 5 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World.

Serial entrepreneurs start new companies, make them successful, and sell them to move on to their next startup. Serial entrepreneurship is on the rise in the U.S. Success stories of figures like Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Square founder Jim McKelvey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia, 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki and several others are fueling inspiration across the country among young people to launch startups. Data from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association suggest that venture capitalists invested a whopping $156.2 billion into domestic startups in 2020 alone.

Serial Entrepreneurship is a Tough Game

But starting and selling companies is not for everyone. Data from TechCrunch suggests that the chances of a startup being acquired at or after Series C are very small. To give you some context, making it to Series C is extremely difficult. TechCrunch’s report said that out of every 1,000 startups that successfully close a Pre-Series A funding round, only 400 make it to Series A.

Successful founders and venture capitalists are also helping startups grow and reach their goals. For example Jim McKelvey launched a startup accelerator SixThirty, which will back four financial-services startups each fall and spring and invest $100,000 a year.

Entrepreneurs who risk starting up a venture are rewarded with profits and growth opportunities if their idea becomes successful. But if their calculations and applications were not properly assessed, they could suffer great losses. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, takes risks repeatedly. A serial entrepreneur analyzes real problems and identifies the solutions for which a large number of customers are willing to pay. Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World

Unlike a traditional entrepreneur who prefers to build a company and stick with it until the end, a serial entrepreneur does not stop at a single venture. Steve Jobs is one of the perfect examples of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world. In 1976, college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computers Inc in a garage. In December 1980, Apple launched its initial public offering selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share. It was a massive hit by the end of the day, as the stock had increased in value by approximately 32%, leaving the company with a market value of $1.778 billion. Today, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) trades at $135.37 per share with a market cap of over $2 trillion. In 1985 Steve Jobs created NeXT, an operating system and business computer company which later on benefited the operating systems of Apple computers. In 1997, Apple bought NeXT for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. In 1986, the serial tech entrepreneur acquired the gold standard of the animated filmmaker, Pixar, for $5 million. In 2006, Jobs sold Pixar to Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) for over $7 billion. Today, Pixar Animated Studios is acknowledged as one of the world's most influential film studios.

The Antifragility of Serial Entrepreneurs

While chasing for success has always been the goal for many business founders, serial entrepreneurs are anti-fragile: they gain from failure. Studies show serial entrepreneurs have greater success than first-timers. As to the obvious reason, serial entrepreneurs have more experience in managing a business as it is natural for them to look for different ventures they could invest in. According to a Harvard Business School paper about ""Performance Persistence in Entrepreneurship"", serial entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed than first-time entrepreneurs or those who have failed in part because serial entrepreneurs ""exhibit persistence in selecting the right industry and time to start new ventures"".

Through the years, serial entrepreneurs have been perfecting their skills in building successful ventures. Another research to back it up was performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in which they observed thousands of startups over 25 years. The purpose of the study entitled ""Skill vs. Luck in Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital"" was precisely to understand whether the success of serial entrepreneurs stems from the skills they have perfected in their careers or from external factors. The study found that ""successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies"" and that ""skills are an important determinant of success for entrepreneurial start-ups"". The study also highlighted the key distinction between previously successful founders and formerly unsuccessful entrepreneurs: ""Entrepreneurs who have been successful in previous business are much more likely to succeed in current business than first-time entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs who have previously failed.""12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs

The seventh wealthiest person in the world started new positions in Verizon, Chevron, Marsh & McLennan and EW Scripps in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to a new 13-F filing with the SEC on Tuesday evening.

Of the fresh positions added to Berkshire's portfolio, Verizon is one of the larger bets as the telecom and digital media giant rolls out high-speed 5G technology. Buffett scooped up 147 million Verizon shares for $8.62 billion. (Verizon is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.) Buffett also boosted his stakes in pharma leaders AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck, Yahoo Finance's Julia LaRoche reported. He trimmed stakes in Wells Fargo and Apple, and exited positions in JPMorgan and PNC Financial.

To be sure, it's interesting to see Buffett so bullish on stocks right now even if he has a forever investment time horizon.

The “Buffett Indicator” as it’s called in Wall Street circles — which takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual U.S. GDP — is now at a record high amid the latest climb to records in the broader market. In doing the math, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 195.7% — up sharply from 175% or so when applying third quarter GDP data.

The figure is well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.

“The stock market is significantly overvalued according to the Buffett Indicator,” said researchers at GuruFocus. “Based on the historical ratio of total market cap over GDP (currently at 195.7%), it is likely to return -3.1% a year from this level of valuation, including dividends.”August 30th 2020 - Warren Buffett celebrates his 90th birthday.

The Buffett Indicator rose to fame after a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and long-time Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.

“The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know. Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment,” explained Buffett in the article.

It really shouldn’t be a surprise to see the indicator as inflated as it is today.

Federal Reserve liquidity continues to run rampant and is fueling new record highs in the stock market. Meanwhile, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to depress economic output.

But Buffett seems bullish anyway. Given the current liquidity backdrop, who can blame him.

Momentum investing is one of the most fundamental quantitative investment strategies for investors seeking profit. Basically, it is the strategy of buying high and selling even high. The term is similar to Newton’s first law of motion which states that when an object is in motion it tends to stay in motion unless a force is applied to it. In relation, a market in motion tends to stay in motion. Basically, trends tend to continue.

The strategy dates back to 2004, when Chicago-based fund manager, Richard Driehaus turned the practice into a strategy. Although he was not the first to use the strategy, he is often called the father of momentum investing. He started buying stocks that already had good price moves and holding on to it as long as the upward price movement continues. He emphasized his discipline in selling the losers as soon as he sees a downward trend and re-investing the money in others upward trend stocks.

Investing in the time of an economic recession can be one of the hardest decisions for an investor given the market volatility. In the contrary, momentum investing goes against the market by taking advantage of positions in rising stocks and selling them the moment they show signs of going down. A momentum investor is more attracted to stocks that have rising prices as an upward trend may seem most likely in a certain period of time. The idea is based on the possibility of a stock that establishes a trend will continue in that direction rather than go against it.15 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Now

If an investor has the ability to identify sectors quickly and accurately, investing in momentum stocks can offer a great chance to gain a winning trade and take profits higher than regular trading opportunities over a short period of time. For instance, in a study by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman covering the US stock returns between 1965-1989, momentum was a significant factor that generated an outperformance of as much as 12.01% per year on average. In a separate study by Grundy and Martin in 2001, where they used NYSE and AMEX listed stocks, it was concluded that momentum profits were stable even after adjustment for dynamic risk exposure.

In order to identify the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now, we started with the 126 holdings from the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF as of February 8, 2021, and we were able to narrow down our list to 15 stocks by using the hedge fund sentiment data.

In order to create the list of the best momentum stocks to buy now, we used our in-house hedge fund sentiment data. Our research has shown that by using the hedge fund sentiment data, we can identify a small group of stocks that can outperform the S&P 500 index on average by double digits annually. For instance, the portfolio for stock picks for our monthly newsletter has beaten the market by over 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see details here) Some of the portfolio choices for our monthly newsletter were also publicly shared on our website. In October, we posted this real estate stock since then it’s been up more than 60 percent.

Based on our hedge fund sentiment data, we present to you the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now among 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:

15. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

No of HFs: 67

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.17 Billion

TSLA is the 15th best momentum stock to buy now. At the end of September, a total of 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider purchased 1,250 shares at around $767 in February 2020. The stock is up 10% since then. Baron Opportunity Fund mentioned TSLA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, and energy storage solutions. The company reported robust second quarter results, solidly ahead of market expectations, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macro-economic challenges. Indeed, in the second quarter, Tesla delivered almost 91,000 total vehicles – with strong unit level economics of 25.4% GAAP automotive gross profit margins – and another quarter of GAAP profitability and solid free cash flow (above $400 million). Moreover, Tesla recently announced a record of nearly 140,000 total vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. Despite global COVID-19 disruptions, our long-term expectations remain high due to Tesla’s differentiated products and healthy unit economics. Tesla has announced capacity expansions in Shanghai, China; Berlin, Germany; and Austin, Texas to support its short-term path to 1 million vehicles and its long-term goal of 20 million. Just a couple of weeks ago, Tesla held its Battery Day event, and presented a grand vision around its battery innovation and expanding its competitive advantages, including massively increasing internal battery production capacity (100 gigawatt-hours by 2022 and 3,000 by 2030), improving battery range (about 50%), and significantly lowering battery costs (cost per kilowatt-hour to decline by over 50%). We remain confident that Tesla will leverage its brand, technology leadership, and the electric vehicle secular trend to achieve sustainable long-term growth.”

14. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.21 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $840 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1,000 shares at around $78 in April 2020. The stock is up 80% since then. L1 Capital International Fund mentioned NKE in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“We reduced our investment in Nike. Nike is performing extremely strongly in a challenging operating environment, gaining share and exceeding our expectations. However, the market has recognised Nike’s strong performance and after a substantial increase in the share price we consider the risk adjusted return potential only warrants a minimum position size.”

13. Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.70 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Dan Loeb’s Third Point which had $645 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 26,784 shares at around $226 in November 2020. The stock is up 4% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned DHR in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Danaher, which designs, manufactures, and markets life science, diagnostics, dental, environmental, and applied solutions, is a prime example of how to use the business strategy of “bolt-on” acquisitions. Led by capital allocation experts the Rales brothers, Danaher will purchase a company in a fragmented industry, create a strategic platform for providing a unique service, and then spin off the company when it can create even more value as an independent entity.

Since Danaher’s bolt-on acquisition of the biopharma business of General Electric’s Life Sciences division for $21.4 billion in March 2019, we have realized a gain of well over 100%. The move boosted Danaher’s stock from around $90 (our purchase price) to the $210s. A gain like this is one of the big upsides of investing in a serial acquirer.”

12. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO)

No of HFs: 80

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.97 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $713 million invested in the stock at the end of September. They are one of the leading suppliers for analytical instruments, reagents and consumables for diagnostic and research purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company reported a $7.09 per share, beating consensus forecast of $6.56 per share.

11. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)

No of HFs: 82

Total Value of HF Holdings: $7.67 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Raiv Jain’s GQG Partners which had $2.54 billion invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 100 shares at around $537 in December 2020. The stock is up 6% since then. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned NVDA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”

10. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)

No of HFs: 87

Total Value of HF Holdings: $2.58 Billion

The 10th best momentum stock to buy now is QCOM. One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which had $445 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 500 shares at around $84 in December 2019. The stock is up 73% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned the stock in its Q2 2019 investor letter:

“When Qualcomm was trading in the low $50s, we bought every share we could. Qualcomm stock rose to around $70 when Broadcom was set to acquire the company, but ultimately the deal did not go through. In April of this year, Qualcomm ended a lengthy and complicated legal battle with Apple over the licensing of Qualcomm’s chip technology in Apple’s mobile devices, including its iPhones. The settlement included a payout from Apple to Qualcomm rumored to be around $6 billion, as well as a six-year licensing agreement and a supply agreement guaranteeing that the chipmaker continue to provide its products to the largest company in the world. With this settlement and the expected increase in product shipments, Qualcomm anticipates an incremental earnings per share of $2. As Qualcomm shareholders, we were able to realize a gain of 54% over a short period of time.”

9. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

No of HFs: 104

Total Value of HF Holdings: $12.8 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 104 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 300 shares at $310 in August 2019. The stock is up 80% since then. Blue Hawk Investment Group mentioned NFLX in ts 4Q 2020 investor letter:

“Netflix round out our top five. This stock we have held since inception of the fund, first buying Netflix at $142 originally in early 2017. A 4x return respectively over the four-year period.”

8. Adobe, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

No of HFs: 106

Total Value of HF Holdings: $10.5 Billion

The top hedge fund holder of this stock is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $2.71 billion invested in the stock at the end of September. Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors mentioned the stock in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

No of HFs: 106

At the end of September, a total of 106 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 400 shares at around $152 in March 2020. The stock is up 55% since then. Alger Spectra Fund mentioned CRM in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

6. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Total Value of HF Holdings: $127 Billion

Apple is a leading technology provider in telecommunications, computing and services. Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives extremely tight engagement with consumers and enterprises. This tight engagement is facilitating significant growth in high-margin services like streaming music. apps. and Apple Pay. Apple’s continued development of high-margin services and earnings streams for wearable devices as well as the potential contribution of 5G phones to the company’s growth supported the performance of Apple shares.”

Momentum investing is one of the most fundamental quantitative investment strategies for investors seeking profit. Basically, it is the strategy of buying high and selling even high. The term is similar to Newton’s first law of motion which states that when an object is in motion it tends to stay in motion unless a force is applied to it. In relation, a market in motion tends to stay in motion. Basically, trends tend to continue.

The strategy dates back to 2004, when Chicago-based fund manager, Richard Driehaus turned the practice into a strategy. Although he was not the first to use the strategy, he is often called the father of momentum investing. He started buying stocks that already had good price moves and holding on to it as long as the upward price movement continues. He emphasized his discipline in selling the losers as soon as he sees a downward trend and re-investing the money in others upward trend stocks.

Investing in the time of an economic recession can be one of the hardest decisions for an investor given the market volatility. In the contrary, momentum investing goes against the market by taking advantage of positions in rising stocks and selling them the moment they show signs of going down. A momentum investor is more attracted to stocks that have rising prices as an upward trend may seem most likely in a certain period of time. The idea is based on the possibility of a stock that establishes a trend will continue in that direction rather than go against it. 15 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Now

If an investor has the ability to identify sectors quickly and accurately, investing in momentum stocks can offer a great chance to gain a winning trade and take profits higher than regular trading opportunities over a short period of time. For instance, in a study by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman covering the US stock returns between 1965-1989, momentum was a significant factor that generated an outperformance of as much as 12.01% per year on average. In a separate study by Grundy and Martin in 2001, where they used NYSE and AMEX listed stocks, it was concluded that momentum profits were stable even after adjustment for dynamic risk exposure.

Based on our hedge fund sentiment data, we present to you the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now among 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:

15. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

No of HFs: 67

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.17 Billion

TSLA is the 15th best momentum stock to buy now. At the end of September, a total of 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider purchased 1,250 shares at around $767 in February 2020. The stock is up 10% since then. Baron Opportunity Fund mentioned TSLA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, and energy storage solutions. The company reported robust second quarter results, solidly ahead of market expectations, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macro-economic challenges. Indeed, in the second quarter, Tesla delivered almost 91,000 total vehicles – with strong unit level economics of 25.4% GAAP automotive gross profit margins – and another quarter of GAAP profitability and solid free cash flow (above $400 million). Moreover, Tesla recently announced a record of nearly 140,000 total vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. Despite global COVID-19 disruptions, our long-term expectations remain high due to Tesla’s differentiated products and healthy unit economics. Tesla has announced capacity expansions in Shanghai, China; Berlin, Germany; and Austin, Texas to support its short-term path to 1 million vehicles and its long-term goal of 20 million. Just a couple of weeks ago, Tesla held its Battery Day event, and presented a grand vision around its battery innovation and expanding its competitive advantages, including massively increasing internal battery production capacity (100 gigawatt-hours by 2022 and 3,000 by 2030), improving battery range (about 50%), and significantly lowering battery costs (cost per kilowatt-hour to decline by over 50%). We remain confident that Tesla will leverage its brand, technology leadership, and the electric vehicle secular trend to achieve sustainable long-term growth.”

14. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.21 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $840 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1,000 shares at around $78 in April 2020. The stock is up 80% since then. L1 Capital International Fund mentioned NKE in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“We reduced our investment in Nike. Nike is performing extremely strongly in a challenging operating environment, gaining share and exceeding our expectations. However, the market has recognised Nike’s strong performance and after a substantial increase in the share price we consider the risk adjusted return potential only warrants a minimum position size.”

13. Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.70 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Dan Loeb’s Third Point which had $645 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 26,784 shares at around $226 in November 2020. The stock is up 4% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned DHR in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Danaher, which designs, manufactures, and markets life science, diagnostics, dental, environmental, and applied solutions, is a prime example of how to use the business strategy of “bolt-on” acquisitions. Led by capital allocation experts the Rales brothers, Danaher will purchase a company in a fragmented industry, create a strategic platform for providing a unique service, and then spin off the company when it can create even more value as an independent entity.

Since Danaher’s bolt-on acquisition of the biopharma business of General Electric’s Life Sciences division for $21.4 billion in March 2019, we have realized a gain of well over 100%. The move boosted Danaher’s stock from around $90 (our purchase price) to the $210s. A gain like this is one of the big upsides of investing in a serial acquirer.”

12. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO)

No of HFs: 80

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.97 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $713 million invested in the stock at the end of September. They are one of the leading suppliers for analytical instruments, reagents and consumables for diagnostic and research purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company reported a $7.09 per share, beating consensus forecast of $6.56 per share.

11. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)

No of HFs: 82

Total Value of HF Holdings: $7.67 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Raiv Jain’s GQG Partners which had $2.54 billion invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 100 shares at around $537 in December 2020. The stock is up 6% since then. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned NVDA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”

10. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)

No of HFs: 87

Total Value of HF Holdings: $2.58 Billion

The 10th best momentum stock to buy now is QCOM. One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which had $445 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 500 shares at around $84 in December 2019. The stock is up 73% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned the stock in its Q2 2019 investor letter:

“When Qualcomm was trading in the low $50s, we bought every share we could. Qualcomm stock rose to around $70 when Broadcom was set to acquire the company, but ultimately the deal did not go through. In April of this year, Qualcomm ended a lengthy and complicated legal battle with Apple over the licensing of Qualcomm’s chip technology in Apple’s mobile devices, including its iPhones. The settlement included a payout from Apple to Qualcomm rumored to be around $6 billion, as well as a six-year licensing agreement and a supply agreement guaranteeing that the chipmaker continue to provide its products to the largest company in the world. With this settlement and the expected increase in product shipments, Qualcomm anticipates an incremental earnings per share of $2. As Qualcomm shareholders, we were able to realize a gain of 54% over a short period of time.”

9. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

No of HFs: 104

Total Value of HF Holdings: $12.8 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 104 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 300 shares at $310 in August 2019. The stock is up 80% since then. Blue Hawk Investment Group mentioned NFLX in ts 4Q 2020 investor letter:

“Netflix round out our top five. This stock we have held since inception of the fund, first buying Netflix at $142 originally in early 2017. A 4x return respectively over the four-year period.”

8. Adobe, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

No of HFs: 106

Total Value of HF Holdings: $10.5 Billion

The top hedge fund holder of this stock is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $2.71 billion invested in the stock at the end of September. Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors mentioned the stock in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“We purchased Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), the leading provider of content creation software. Adobe is a software company with a recurring revenue stream, which should insulate it from some of the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

7. Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)

No of HFs: 106

Total Value of HF Holdings: $11.0 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 106 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 400 shares at around $152 in March 2020. The stock is up 55% since then. Alger Spectra Fund mentioned CRM in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

6. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

No of HFs: 134

Total Value of HF Holdings: $127 Billion

A total of 134 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock at the end of September.

108,2021-02-13T18:21:20+00:00,Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article, we examined billionaire Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picks to see how these stocks performed in 2020 and what the future prospects are. Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of investing in high growth stocks paid off in 2020 as his 8 out of the top ten positions outperformed the broader market index. Indeed, the majority of his top 25 positions generated better performance than the S&P 500 index in 2020, thanks to investments in information technology, financial services, and consumer discretionary stocks. His investment firm has also been holding positions in fast-growing companies from the healthcare and communications sectors.

In addition to investing in the fastest-growing companies, the firm also likes to buy depressed stocks that have strong fundamentals. The firm believes in the demand and supply idea when it comes to pricing any stock. Fisher Asset Management, which is employing several teams of research analysts for finding the best investment opportunities, created positions in 118 stocks during the fourth quarter.

In addition, the firm likes to hold a stake for the long-term to benefit from share price gains and dividends. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s asset management firm added to its 388 existing positions during the fourth quarter.

The average time held for the top ten stocks stands around 11.6 quarters while the time held for the top 20 stocks averages around 13.65 quarters.

Billionaire Ken Fisher sold out 48 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2020 and reduced his positions in 378 stocks. Overall, the firm held a position in 957 stocks, according to the latest 13F filings. Ken Fisher - FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT

Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management

Founded in 1979 and incorporated in 1986, Fisher Asset Management ended the fourth quarter with $133 billion in 13F portfolio market value, up significantly from $114 billion in the previous quarter and $98 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Ken Fisher is the heart and soul of Fisher Asset Management and currently serving as the executive chairman and co-chief investment officer. He is the son of legendary investor Philip A. Fisher. Ken Fisher is also a columnist and author. He has written several books on finance.

Story continues

While Ken Fisher’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start examining billionaire Ken Fisher’s top ten stock picks to determine returns in 2020 and what are the future prospects of these positions. Its top ten stock holdings account for almost 32% of the overall portfolio.

10. Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM)

The customer relationship software developer Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is the tenth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. The firm has benefited from its large position because shares of CRM rallied almost 28% in the last twelve months compared to the S&P 500 growth of almost 17%.

Alger Spectra Fund also believes that Salesforce is a good stock to buy and hold for the long-term. Here is what Alger Spectra Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

Polen Capital also talked about CRM in its Q4 investor letter:

“We discussed Salesforce.com in the third quarter, but the former went from our top contributor last quarter to the largest detractor this quarter. The double-digit share price decline in the quarter seemed mostly driven by investor reaction after Salesforce announced it would acquire Slack, a collaboration software company, for approximately $28 billion, a high purchase price. While the purchase price is higher than we expected, we believe Slack and its functionality fit well strategically with Salesforce’s suite of enterprise software offerings. At a high-level, Slack offers the ability to make both Salesforce’s and other third-party applications work better for their respective customers. In addition, Salesforce’s world-class selling organization and already large customer base should be beneficial for Slack’s subscription revenue growth, which has been more customer-referral based up to this point. It is too early to know if this acquisition will prove to be a smart allocation of investor capital. That said, Slack has a unique value proposition and was growing nicely on a standalone basis. We believe the Salesforce-Slack strategic vision is on point; and although the purchase price is high in absolute dollars, it represents less than 15% of Salesforce’s market capitalization.

We maintain an optimistic view of Salesforce’s business, its competitive positioning within enterprise software, and the rationale behind the Slack acquisition. We expect strong, continued earnings and free cash flow growth many years into the future.”

9. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE)

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of holding a position in Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has also added to its performance in 2020. Shares of Adobe rallied 34% in the last twelve months, thanks to strong demand for its products. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.18% of the overall portfolio.

Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors stated in an investor’s letter that Adobe is likely to perform well despite pandemic related challenges. Here is what Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors said:

“We purchased Adobe, the leading provider of content creation software. Adobe is a software company with a recurring revenue stream, which should insulate it from some of the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

Polen Capital also talked about ADBE in its Q4 investor letter:

“Adobe has been a strong performer since our initial purchase in early 2016 and has since compounded annually over 40%. This year has been no exception, with the business performing superbly and the stock appreciating by over 50%. CEO Shantanu Narayen stated, “This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe.” In addition to consistent and recurring double digit revenue growth, its margin expansion has significantly boosted its earnings power. Non-GAAP operating margins have expanded by over 550 bps in the past year. At the same time, we also believe that CEO Narayen deserves more credit for his capital allocation prowess. He has made sound acquisitions that have boosted the value proposition of his company’s products while strengthening the competitive advantages of the business.”

8. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surged almost 40% in the last twelve months on the back of increasing demand for digital ads. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 2.19% of the overall portfolio.

Giverny Capital Asset Management LLC claims that Alphabet needs to be disciplined in its spending. Here is what Giverny Capital Asset Management stated in an investors letter:

“Alphabet is our largest holding. We’re biased, but we’d argue that Alphabet is reasonably priced. It earns significant profit from travel-related searches, which are way down this year. Travel spending figures to roar back at some point, possibly soon. Alphabet also spends extravagant amounts on R&D and capital spending as it finances younger ventures. Those other businesses, which include YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars and cloud computing centers, plus research in artificial intelligence, should eventually generate meaningful returns for shareholders. Or at worst, they will consume less investment over time. If Alphabet simply exercises discipline over investment spending for a few years as travel advertising rebounds and the core search business grows, the resulting free cash flow should generate satisfactory returns for owners.”

7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM)

The chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best performing stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. This is because shares of TSM jumped 135% in the last twelve months. In addition, the firm has also been bagging big dividends from Taiwan Semiconductor. The company offers a dividend yield of 1.31% despite strong share price gains in the last twelve months.

First Eagle Investment Management claims that Taiwan Semiconductor is set to expand its market share in the days ahead. Here is what First Eagle Investment Management stated in an investors letter:

“Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) traded higher during the quarter on signs that its total addressable market was poised to expand. Intel announced that it was facing delays in the manufacture of its next-generation chips and may contract out the work to third parties, opening the door for a large-scale chip “foundry” like TSMC to pick up some of the business. Foundries make chips designed and named by other companies; TSMC already produces certain chips for Intel.”

6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA)

Despite concerns over regulatory issues, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) stock price managed to outperform the broader market index. Shares of Alibaba are up 21% in the past twelve months, meaning Fisher Asset Management has benefited from its stake. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.43% of the overall portfolio.

Polen Capital Management, a value-driven, concentrated, long-term investment management firm, highlighted few stocks including Alibaba in an investor’s letter. Here is what Polen Capital Management stated:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier-one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

Polen Capital also talked about CRM in its Q4 investor letter:

“We discussed Salesforce.com in the third quarter, but the former went from our top contributor last quarter to the largest detractor this quarter. The double-digit share price decline in the quarter seemed mostly driven by investor reaction after Salesforce announced it would acquire Slack, a collaboration software company, for approximately $28 billion, a high purchase price. While the purchase price is higher than we expected, we believe Slack and its functionality fit well strategically with Salesforce’s suite of enterprise software offerings. At a high-level, Slack offers the ability to make both Salesforce’s and other third-party applications work better for their respective customers. In addition, Salesforce’s world-class selling organization and already large customer base should be beneficial for Slack’s subscription revenue growth, which has been more customer-referral based up to this point. It is too early to know if this acquisition will prove to be a smart allocation of investor capital. That said, Slack has a unique value proposition and was growing nicely on a standalone basis. We believe the Salesforce-Slack strategic vision is on point; and although the purchase price is high in absolute dollars, it represents less than 15% of Salesforce’s market capitalization.

We maintain an optimistic view of Salesforce’s business, its competitive positioning within enterprise software, and the rationale behind the Slack acquisition. We expect strong, continued earnings and free cash flow growth many years into the future.”

9. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE)

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of holding a position in Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has also added to its performance in 2020. Shares of Adobe rallied 34% in the last twelve months, thanks to strong demand for its products. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.18% of the overall portfolio.

Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors stated in an investor’s letter that Adobe is likely to perform well despite pandemic related challenges. Here is what Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors said:

“We purchased Adobe, the leading provider of content creation software. Adobe is a software company with a recurring revenue stream, which should insulate it from some of the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

Polen Capital also talked about ADBE in its Q4 investor letter:

“Adobe has been a strong performer since our initial purchase in early 2016 and has since compounded annually over 40%. This year has been no exception, with the business performing superbly and the stock appreciating by over 50%. CEO Shantanu Narayen stated, “This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe.” In addition to consistent and recurring double digit revenue growth, its margin expansion has significantly boosted its earnings power. Non-GAAP operating margins have expanded by over 550 bps in the past year. At the same time, we also believe that CEO Narayen deserves more credit for his capital allocation prowess. He has made sound acquisitions that have boosted the value proposition of his company’s products while strengthening the competitive advantages of the business.”

8. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surged almost 40% in the last twelve months on the back of increasing demand for digital ads. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 2.19% of the overall portfolio.

Giverny Capital Asset Management LLC claims that Alphabet needs to be disciplined in its spending. Here is what Giverny Capital Asset Management stated in an investors letter:

“Alphabet is our largest holding. We’re biased, but we’d argue that Alphabet is reasonably priced. It earns significant profit from travel-related searches, which are way down this year. Travel spending figures to roar back at some point, possibly soon. Alphabet also spends extravagant amounts on R&D and capital spending as it finances younger ventures. Those other businesses, which include YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars and cloud computing centers, plus research in artificial intelligence, should eventually generate meaningful returns for shareholders. Or at worst, they will consume less investment over time. If Alphabet simply exercises discipline over investment spending for a few years as travel advertising rebounds and the core search business grows, the resulting free cash flow should generate satisfactory returns for owners.”

7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM)

The chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best performing stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. This is because shares of TSM jumped 135% in the last twelve months. In addition, the firm has also been bagging big dividends from Taiwan Semiconductor. The company offers a dividend yield of 1.31% despite strong share price gains in the last twelve months.

First Eagle Investment Management claims that Taiwan Semiconductor is set to expand its market share in the days ahead. Here is what First Eagle Investment Management stated in an investors letter:

“Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) traded higher during the quarter on signs that its total addressable market was poised to expand. Intel announced that it was facing delays in the manufacture of its next-generation chips and may contract out the work to third parties, opening the door for a large-scale chip “foundry” like TSMC to pick up some of the business. Foundries make chips designed and named by other companies; TSMC already produces certain chips for Intel.”

6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA)

Despite concerns over regulatory issues, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) stock price managed to outperform the broader market index. Shares of Alibaba are up 21% in the past twelve months, meaning Fisher Asset Management has benefited from its stake. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.43% of the overall portfolio.

Polen Capital Management, a value-driven, concentrated, long-term investment management firm, highlighted few stocks including Alibaba in an investor’s letter. Here is what Polen Capital Management stated:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier-one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

112,2021-02-12T21:34:48+00:00,"Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm Protest Nvidia’s Acquisition of Arm Ltd.","(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s largest technology companies are complaining to U.S. antitrust regulators about Nvidia Corp.’s acquisition of Arm Ltd. because the deal will harm competition in an area of the industry that is vital to their businesses.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are among companies worried about the $40 billion deal and are urging antitrust officials to intervene, said people familiar with the process who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. At least one of the companies wants the deal killed. Nvidia shares fell as much as 3.1% in New York trading on Friday.

The acquisition would give Nvidia control over a critical supplier that licenses essential chip technology to the likes of Apple Inc., Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and China’s Huawei Technologies Co.

U.K.-based Arm is known as the Switzerland of the industry because it licenses chip designs and related software code to all comers, rather than competing against semiconductor companies. The concern is that if Nvidia owns Arm, it could limit rivals’ access to the technology or raise the cost of access.

Nvidia has argued that the purchase price alone means it has no incentive to mess with that neutrality but some rivals and Arm customers are unconvinced.

“As we proceed through the review process, we’re confident that both regulators and customers will see the benefits of our plan to continue Arm’s open licensing model and ensure a transparent, collaborative relationship with Arm’s licensees,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “Our vision for Arm will help all Arm licensees grow their businesses and expand into new markets.” Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Arm declined to comment. CNBC reported Qualcomm’s objections earlier.

Before the deal can close, Nvidia must get through a long review process by antitrust officials in the U.S., U.K., European Union and China. Government agencies globally are in the process of reaching out to those they believe may be affected by the transaction.

Story continues

A groundswell of opposition from large tech companies may make it difficult to win approval, delay the process or force concessions that change the value of Arm to Nvidia. This is also a risk for SoftBank Group Corp., the current owner of Arm. The Japanese conglomerate has been trying to sell some assets to pay down debt and buy back stock.

In the U.S., the deal is under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which has opened an in-depth investigation of the merger and has sent information demands to third parties, according to a person familiar with the matter. The FTC declined to comment.

The changing leadership of the FTC could make winning approval tougher for Nvidia. The commission is generally split 2-2 along party lines at the moment, with Democratic commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter holding the acting chair position. Power will shift to the Democrats when U.S. President Joe Biden picks two candidates to fill an open seat and the seat held by Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who has been nominated to take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Deals like Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm, known as vertical mergers, are typically seen as less worrisome in the eyes of antitrust enforcers because the companies don’t compete head to head. But that view has come under fire from advocates of more aggressive antitrust enforcement who say regulators have downplayed the competitive harm from such deals.

Slaughter’s elevation signals a tougher approval process for vertical deals. Before taking over the agency, Slaughter criticized new guidelines issued last year by the FTC and the Justice Department outlining how the agencies would evaluate vertical deals. She said the guidelines overemphasize the potential benefits of such mergers and are “inexplicably mute” about the harms.

In December, Slaughter and Chopra said companies should no longer rely on the guidelines as an indication of how the FTC will police vertical deals.

“Moving forward, we need to aggressively enforce against the harms of vertical mergers,” they wrote. “We look forward to turning the page on the era of lax oversight and to beginning to investigate, analyze, and enforce the antitrust laws against vertical mergers with vigor.”

113,2021-02-11T20:57:03+00:00,"PayPal Looks to Stock Trading, Savings in Push Past Checkout","(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. is weighing a foray into stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as the firm pushes beyond its iconic checkout button.

The payments giant expects the number of active users on its sprawling platform to climb to 750 million by the end of 2025 -- roughly double the current level -- as it expands into new areas of financial services, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said Thursday at the company’s investor day. With its latest plans, PayPal aims to become the world’s next financial super-app, akin to Chinese firms Alipay and WeChat Pay.

“There’s few companies in the world that can even aspire to this vision,” Schulman said. “It requires capabilities that cross industries, from financial services to payments to shopping to technology.”

PayPal is coming off a record year, when spending on its platform soared 31% as consumers turned to online shopping in droves after the pandemic shuttered stores around the globe. The firm added 72.7 million users during the year as revenue climbed to $21.5 billion.

The performance came even as PayPal’s main business of speeding up the online checkout process has seen intense competition from the likes of Apple Inc. as well as payment giants Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. Still, it’s an area PayPal dominates: The firm’s button has been added to nearly three-quarters of the leading U.S. retail sites, according to a survey last year by Pymnts.com.

One Stop

Now PayPal has set its sights on turning itself into a one-stop shop for consumers and merchants alike to conduct their finances. The firm said new products could include stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as well as bill-payment capabilities and check-cashing services.

The firm’s new digital wallet will be divided into a financial services tab, a payments tab and a shopping tab, Schulman said in an interview following the investor-day event. PayPal hopes to debut the new features within the next two years.

Story continues

“We are doing a lot organically because our platform and our product capabilities are as robust as they’ve ever been,” Schulman said in the interview. “But we’ll also look to partner with people,” he said, adding that “we’re also looking at the potential of acquisitions where that might make sense.”

The company is leaning into the success it’s already seen from adding the ability for users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in digital wallets in recent months. Half of all customers who took advantage of the feature now log into the app every day -- meaning PayPal has become a destination for those customers, rather than a place they turn to on an as-needed basis.

Driving Revenue

“This is precisely the type of engagement that we want to see as we add these additional financial services,” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said.

That’s because that sort of activity, in turn, drives revenue. Schulman said the firm now expects the average amount of revenue it collects from each user to grow substantially over the next five years.

PayPal is now on track to more than double revenue to $50 billion in 2025 as payments volume on its platforms triples to $2.8 trillion. The firm also expects to generate $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years.

PayPal’s shares rose 0.5% to $284.62 at 3:28 p.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 6.7% in earlier trading. The stock has increased 673% since it was spun off from EBay Inc. in 2015, compared with the 89% advance of the S&P 500 Index.

PayPal has warned that some of the new initiatives caused an uptick in spending on technology and development. Such costs already rose 27% to $2.64 billion last year. Still, the firm has said it expects profits to climb 17% on an adjusted basis this year.

“We really hit our stride in 2020,” Schulman said. “And I’m so excited about what we plan to deliver and what we are going to deliver in this year and in the years to come.”

114,2021-02-11T20:27:55+00:00,Podz app helps consumers discover podcasts via a newsfeed,"Yahoo Finance’s Kristin Myers and Melody Hahm, along with Doug Imbruce, founder & CEO of Podz, discuss the launch of the company’s new app, which helps consumers discover more podcasts.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: Now let's turn now to that conversation on podcasts. We're joined now by Doug Imbruce, founder and CEO of Podz, and Yahoo Finance's Melody Hahm. So Doug, I don't want to spend too, too much time because there's so much interesting stuff to get into here. But I'm hoping for everyone at home if you can explain a little bit how Podz works.

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, sure, so it's funny. You know, Melody wrote the other day about sort of the golden age of audio. And while it is a golden age and we're seeing more podcasts being produced than ever by these really thoughtful, incredibly knowledgeable creators, for consumers, it doesn't feel much like a golden age because the process of discovering podcasts and using these decades old directories, it really-- it hasn't changed. And if you look at the data, it sort of supports this gap. We're only more than-- about 1% of podcasters reach more than 5,000 listeners.

And so, at Podz, we thought we could sort of transform the discovery of podcast content with a really modern experience that basically matches the kind of experience you have when you use apps like TikTok and Instagram and Snap and automatically transforms podcasts into a personal feed of highlights that you can enjoy and save full episodes to listen later. So we're just trying to grow the audience for podcasts overall and help people fit this amazing medium into their digital-- busy digital lives.

MELODY HAHM: Doug, there is a humorous component to this moment, right? Because it's basically radio, what we're listening to. And Podz is essentially creating snippets of compelling conversations, and you can go deeper, right? You can choose to listen to a full episode in-app. What do you make of this structural shift back to perhaps the '80s, when podcasting first started, and that it feels like perhaps the innovation has actually been stunted and that there isn't any new territory to really explore?

Story continues

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, no, I mean, look, it's a great point. If you look at every other medium, it has been digitally transformed. So, right? When text was was brought online, Twitter basically took the idea of long blog posts and transformed it into these short 140-character tweets by building a platform around creative limits. TikTok did the same thing in video, Instagram via their photo filters. But to your point, that same transformation has not happened in podcasting. And we think it's limiting growth.

MELODY HAHM: You know, Doug, looking at the space with a lot of this consolidation that's happened, Spotify is the player to beat, right, when it comes to content creation and also the pipes as well. As I understand it, Podz now hosts about 5,000 podcasts. You've been able to aggregate some of that manually, some of that with big data. But you don't have original podcasts on the platform.

Believe it or not, I'm sure everyone watching knows that Joe Rogan from the Obamas to Brené Brown, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, they are all Spotify original podcasts. How are you able to make sure you can have all of the premium high quality content on the platform when there seems to be more of this race to get creators to be sort of tied to individual platforms?

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, you know, it's unfortunate that everybody talks about the big names in the space with these incredibly lucrative deals who typically have either pre-existing platforms. You know, either they're sort of media personalities or existing celebrities that Spotify pays to create original exclusive content that goes behind Podify-- Spotify's paywall.

Because, you know, as sort of we dig into the industries ourselves, as a company that wants to disrupt the experience of podcast consumption, there's just so many other incredible creators that nobody is talking about. And we hope, similar to the way, again, companies like TikTok and Instagram and Twitter created platforms that allowed creators to be elevated and built these incredible network effects through these really modern experiences, that we can bring that same approach to podcasting.

And hopefully next time we speak, you'll be talking about, you know, the long tail of incredible creators. And we don't have to keep people's attention focused on Joe Rogan because I don't want to live in a world where everybody listens to only Joe Rogan every day.

KRISTIN MYERS: So that brings me to a question that I have to ask you, which is about Clubhouse. You know, Melody and I were listening to a chat that you were doing yesterday on that app. I mean, as you were mentioning, there's so many content creators out there. They're are inking those really big deals. But there's, as you said, tons of content creators that no one has even heard about. So how does an app like Clubhouse really turn that industry on its head and kind of change the game for the audio-only industry?

DOUG IMBRUCE: Yeah, I mean, it's unfortunately, in Clubhouse, I think you're seeing a lot of the same dynamics sort of take shape. Because while Clubhouse is an incredibly powerful tool for live broadcasting, the discovery experience inside an app like Clubhouse, where you load the feed and sort of the most popular rooms appear first, it just seems like kind of an echo chamber, similar to-- you know, the same kind of personalities that are appearing in traditional podcasting.

You know, again, apps that really help this-- us discover this long tail-- again, Twitter, TikTok-- those, to us, are models that are far more exciting. Not to mention that, you know, we're living through a pandemic and everybody is sort of this incredibly captive audience now, right? And so these are live events. They create urgency. And certainly, they drive traffic. But the internet is an on-demand medium.

And so we're excited to introduce a platform that conforms to the way that people traditionally experience their content, which is on-demand and asynchronously, and again, really focused on elevating that long tail. Because as exciting as it is to hear what Elon Musk has to say, again, you don't want to listen to the same kind of folks every day.

KRISTIN MYERS: So Doug, when you were talking about Twitter taking text and shortening it, and then you mentioned, of course, TikTok, which, of course, everyone thinks about Vine, which took video and decided to make content in just a couple of seconds or less, I'm wondering if you see that also coming in the podcast industry, where we might have an audio-only Quibi coming up soon.

DOUG IMBRUCE: Quibi, yeah, it's-- [LAUGHS] No, but it's-- look, I think that the great thing about audio is how deep and how thoughtful the content is. But because the average podcast is over 40 minutes in length, again, in kind of today's world where everyone's trained on not just consuming short form content, but also sharing it, these longer audio files, get left behind.

And that's why we've invested so much time in this layer of digital transformation, where we can actually evaluate the content of every podcast, surface the most engaging 60 seconds through machine learning, and then deliver those highlights in a feed that allows you to, as Melody mentioned, then go deeper.

And so we see Podz almost as a lead generation engine for time shifting the consumption of these longer form shows that are really thoughtful, really interesting, but that you just don't always have time to consume in the moment.

KRISTIN MYERS: I'm super new to podcasts. I literally only listen to two right now. So I'm definitely going to have to check out Podz to see what other podcasts are out there that I would be interested in. Doug Imbruce, Podz founder and CEO, and of course, Yahoo Finance's Melody Hahm, thank you both for joining us for this conversation.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/podz-app-helps-consumers-discover-202755868.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'CNDT.US', 'SPOT.US']","['DOUG IMBRUCE', 'MELODY HAHM', 'PODCASTERS', 'PODCASTS']","{'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.089}"
115,2021-02-11T20:10:16+00:00,Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones’ Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article we will take a look at billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' top 10 stocks picks. If you want to skip our discussion about Paul Tudor Jones' investment philosophy, his thoughts on Bitcoin and his history, go directly to billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' top 5 stocks picks.

Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, is considered one of the pioneers of the current hedge fund industry. With over $5.1 billion net worth, PTJ is known for predicting the Black Monday collapse of 1987. Tudor teaches an undergrad class at the University of Virginia.

He uses 200-day moving average of closing prices to evaluate market trends. Paul advises against contrarian investing.

Paul began his career in commodities trading before forming the Tudor Group in 1980. After four decades, Tudor has grown into a global investment firm.

On a side note, billionaire Tudor Jones was one of the hedge fund managers who believed in Bitcoin and backed the digital currency last December. He thinks that Bitcoin is hard to value and is similar to what the internet was during its early stages where no one was able to correctly predict its value due to the possibility that lay ahead.

Earlier last year, he included Bitcoin on his list of inflation hedges and considered it ""the fastest horse"" in the race to beat inflation. According to Jones, Bitcoin scored far better profitability and liquidity levels versus its asset peers, and was extremely undervalued on a market cap outstanding basis relative to other asset classes as a hedge against inflation.

Jones traded Bitcoin for the first time in 2017. At that time he doubled his invested money before exiting the trade near the peak price of the cryptocurrency at $20,000. However, in 2020, he considered Bitocin as a store of value and inflation hedge.

He stated:

""The most compelling argument for owning Bitcoin is the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19.""

Story continues

The digital currency had advanced more than 300% in 2020 and is currently trading above $45,000. Moreover, analysts think that the resurgence of the cryptocurrency last year was mainly driven by the endorsement of institutional investors which gave confidence to retail investors in this asset class. Jones’ statements on Bitcoin may have been among the catalysts that pushed its price towards new high levels.

Tudor Investment Corporation has disclosed 1,238 total holdings in their latest SEC filings, as of the end of the third quarter. The market value of the fund holdings was estimated at nearly $2.30 billion, with major investments in consumer services and technology stocks. Those sectors represented 18.3% and 15.4% of the fund respectively. Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' Top 10 Stock Picks

Let’s take a look at billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' top 10 stock picks.

10. Natura &Co Holding S.A. (NYSE: NTCO)

Tudor has a history of taking positions in derivatives of Natura & Co. (NYSE: NTCO) in the form of stock options. As of the end of the third quarter, he held put options on 900,000 shares constituting 0.7% of his overall portfolio. The position remained unchanged during the quarter and the company was the tenth largest holding of TJP. Natura & Co. (NYSE: NTCO), a multinational cosmetics, hygiene and beauty company, posted strong revenue growth during the third quarter of 2020. However its share value decreased by 18% during the last twelve months. The company is significantly outperforming the global Cosmetics, Fragrance, and Toiletries market. In fact, it managed to raise its capital by an additional $1 billion during October 2020.

During 2020, the company took another step forward in its digitalization process and successfully launched &Co Pay, which represents its proprietary financial services platform helping consultants and representatives achieve higher productivity. &Co Pay was initially launched in Latin America, and is expected to roll out globally within the next years.

9. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ: KDP)

Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ: KDP) shares witnessed an 11.46% appreciation in price during the last twelve months. Paul Tudor Jones has initiated a position in the company during the third quarter of 2020 with a market value of $19.544 million. About 0.8% of Tudor’s portfolio was allocated to KDP, which is an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

KDP benefited during the prior year from the shift in consumer behavior following the emergence of COVID-19 and the strong growth in at-home coffee consumption. This new customer behavior is expected to increase the company’s market share during the coming periods. For that matter, Keurig Dr Pepper is investing in its e-commerce operations and its distribution platforms.

Keurig Dr Pepper pays an annual dividend of $0.60 per share and currently its dividend yield is 1.81%. The company has a market cap of $44.75 billion. Its revenue increased by 66% over the last three years.

Diluted earnings per share were steadily increasing during 2020, recording $0.29, $0.38 and $0.43 per share, respectively, for the first, second and third quarter of 2020.

Oakmark Fund, in their Q3 2020 Investor Letter, highlighted a few stocks and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) was one of them. Here is what Oakmark Fund stated:

""Keurig Dr Pepper is one of North America’s leading beverage companies and commands dominant positions in single-serve coffee and flavored sodas. We believe single-serve coffee pods will capture almost all of the incremental growth in at-home coffee consumption because coffee drinkers increasingly prefer K-Cups over drip brewing due to its greater convenience, quality, variety and value. Keurig’s competitive advantages (low-cost production, the largest installed base of brewers, exclusive brand partnerships) allow it to collect a toll on most pods sold in North America. The company’s soda franchises remain highly profitable, and we do not expect health-related concerns about sugar to materially impact consumption trends. We believe that Keurig’s brands should deliver steady growth, consistent market share gains and significant excess cash. We think the company is an above-average business trading at a meaningful discount to the broader market, its beverage peers and historical private market transactions.”

If you want to skip our discussion about Paul Tudor Jones' investment philosophy, his thoughts on Bitcoin and his history, go directly to billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' top 5 stocks picks.

Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, is considered one of the pioneers of the current hedge fund industry. With over $5.1 billion net worth, PTJ is known for predicting the Black Monday collapse of 1987. Tudor teaches an undergrad class at the University of Virginia.

He uses 200-day moving average of closing prices to evaluate market trends. Paul advises against contrarian investing.

Paul began his career in commodities trading before forming the Tudor Group in 1980. After four decades, Tudor has grown into a global investment firm.

On a side note, billionaire Tudor Jones was one of the hedge fund managers who believed in Bitcoin and backed the digital currency last December. He thinks that Bitcoin is hard to value and is similar to what the internet was during its early stages where no one was able to correctly predict its value due to the possibility that lay ahead.

Earlier last year, he included Bitcoin on his list of inflation hedges and considered it ""the fastest horse"" in the race to beat inflation. According to Jones, Bitcoin scored far better profitability and liquidity levels versus its asset peers, and was extremely undervalued on a market cap outstanding basis relative to other asset classes as a hedge against inflation.

Jones traded Bitcoin for the first time in 2017. At that time he doubled his invested money before exiting the trade near the peak price of the cryptocurrency at $20,000. However, in 2020, he considered Bitocin as a store of value and inflation hedge.

He stated:

""The most compelling argument for owning Bitcoin is the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19.""

The digital currency had advanced more than 300% in 2020 and is currently trading above $45,000. Moreover, analysts think that the resurgence of the cryptocurrency last year was mainly driven by the endorsement of institutional investors which gave confidence to retail investors in this asset class. Jones’ statements on Bitcoin may have been among the catalysts that pushed its price towards new high levels.

Tudor Investment Corporation has disclosed 1,238 total holdings in their latest SEC filings, as of the end of the third quarter. The market value of the fund holdings was estimated at nearly $2.30 billion, with major investments in consumer services and technology stocks.

117,2021-02-11T09:02:59+00:00,15 Fastest-Growing Software Companies,"In this article we mention 15 fastest-growing software companies in the world. If you want to skip our discussion of the future of the software industry, analysts' predictions about software companies and job creation in the space, go directly to 5 fastest-growing software companies companies.

Software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. According to data by Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected to reach $4 trillion in 2021. Companies worldwide are embracing automation, Cloud computing, data analytics, websites, social media and AI to enhance their business and capture their customers online. This is driving the growth of software companies, especially SaaS. Data from U.S. Department of Labor shows that software is one of the fastest-growing industries when it comes to job creation. Jobs in computer and information technology as a whole are expected to grow 11% from 2019 through 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. Specifically in the software space, jobs are expected to grow by 22% through 2029, must faster than the average. To quote Marc Andreessen, software is eating the world.

Software companies create and build different programs that assist companies and individuals to solve key problems. Software companies are offering products and services in almost all walks of human life, including finance, entertainment, education, shopping, sports, military and healthcare. The coronavirus crisis fueled growth in the industry as companies scrambled to move their operations online: schools needed education software; retailers looked for ways to increase their online sales; banks started creating secure and user-friendly apps to allow customers perform their transactions by staying at home; and governments increased their IT spending to get rid of age-old ways of doing business.

IT jobs pay higher than most of the jobs in other industries. IT companies are also giving a boost to overall productivity. These factors are pushing GDP growth in the U.S. A report by the BSA Foundation shows that the software industry accounted for $1.6 trillion of the total $20.5 trillion U.S. GDP in 2018.

Story continues 15 Fastest-Growing Software Companies

The growth of software companies could be gauged from the fact that The Big Five — Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) — had a combined valuation of $3.3 trillion, and accounted for about 40% of the value of the Nasdaq 100, as of 2017. Other than these giants, software companies like Salesforce, Shopify, Palantir, ServiceNow, PayPal, Square and Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO) are posting explosive growth numbers as well. The core reason for this growth and dominance is the fact that these companies are solving key problems and offering solutions that are full of value. In the words of legendary investor Peter Thiel, they have become monopolies by virtue of the value and satisfaction they give to their customers. Software companies also grow fast because they have low marginal costs and big potential to scale.

Its solutions address complex, industrial environments where it is critical to optimize the asset design, operation and maintenance lifecycle. Companies in capital intensive industries can use Aspen Technology’s unique set of assets to maximize uptime and push the limits of performance, running their assets safer, greener, longer and faster.

We had considered the company for the inception portfolio but decided to wait and watch it as we had concerns about how low oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainty back in March might affect their business. We have since been impressed with the company’s ability to navigate the tough macro environment, and oil prices have improved. We believe it has been able to deliver very attractive growth despite the macro uncertainty, giving us more confidence to start a position during the quarter. We think the company has an outstanding competitive position, a highly recurring business model, robust margins and returns, and a management team that exhibits all the behaviors that we seek, especially value-creating reinvestment.”

RV Capital in their Q4 2020 investor letter said that they saw a spectacular value in Slack Technologies, Inc. and acquired a position in the company. Here is what RV Capital stated:

""We became co-owners in Slack, a channels-based communication service for businesses. In an unexpected twist, a few months later it was acquired by Salesforce.com at roughly a 50% premium to what we had paid.

In accordance with my usual practice, I was planning on writing about our investment in Slack. By laying out my investment hypothesis at the onset of an investment, I hope to enable investors to assess in hindsight whether it worked (or not) because of a plausible investment philosophy consistently applied. Given that Slack has effectively already played out as an investment, this rationale has gone. After all, anyone can make a successful investment decision look smart after the fact.

There is one element of my Slack investment thesis that I would like to lay out as it neatly illustrates an idea in my first-half letter and has not yet played out. I wrote then that I wanted to invest more in “early-stage, listed companies”. What I meant by this are companies whose moat is not yet fully developed, but not so undeveloped that it is difficult to say if they will ever have one. I described early-stage companies as possessing:

The kernel of an idea (however unformed), which – if you squint – you can imagine creating a new paradigm in decades to come.

Slack was the type of company I had in mind when I wrote this. Its moat in its core business of providing channels-based communication within companies is well developed. It benefits from a network effect (the more employees on Slack, the higher the value they derive from it), a broad developer ecosystem (thousands of integrations have been built for Slack) and switching costs (Slack becomes tightly interwoven into a company’s workflow through said integrations).

What really got me excited – the new paradigm – is “Slack Connect”. Connect is a feature that allows companies to extend Slack beyond their own organisation to external partners. Connect has not yet achieved viral growth – the moat is not yet developed.”

Revenue(2015): $313 million

Alger Small Cap Focus Fund in their Q3 2020 investor letter highlighted a few stocks and Veeva Systems Inc is one of them. Here is what Alger Small Cap Focus Fund stated:

""Veeva Systems is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for the global life sciences industry. Veeva’s key solutions are Commercial Cloud products, offering multi-channel customer relationship management software, and Veeva Vault, offering regulated content management for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Shares of Veeva performed strongly after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal second quarter 2021 results and raised its fiscal-year 2021 earnings and billings guidance. Veeva’s key growth driver continues to be strong adoption of Veeva Vault, with particular strength in the fiscal second quarter in its Quality Suite and Clinical Trial Management system. Veeva is making good progress on its recent acquisitions of Crossix, which provides a platform for optimizing health care marketing, and Physicians World. which provides a physicians’ speaker bureau. Since the earlier days of the pandemic in March, Veeva has offered its Veeva CRM Engage products to life sciences customers for free to enable virtual sales visits. Veeva intends to convert a large portion of these new customers into annual subscription contracts next year, as virtual selling has become more important during Covid-19. Finally, Veeva announced the formation of a board committee to explore the conversion of Veeva into a for-profit public-benefit corporation. Veeva would be the first public company to make this change. We believe this potential change would align well with Veeva’s existing culture and operations, that Veeva will still have the legal duty to maximize shareholder value and that the change could potentially create greater trust in Veeva to properly handle proprietary customer data.”

If you want to skip our discussion of the future of the software industry, analysts' predictions about software companies and job creation in the space, go directly to 5 fastest-growing software companies companies.

Software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. According to data by Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected to reach $4 trillion in 2021. Companies worldwide are embracing automation, Cloud computing, data analytics, websites, social media and AI to enhance their business and capture their customers online. This is driving the growth of software companies, especially SaaS. Data from U.S. Department of Labor shows that software is one of the fastest-growing industries when it comes to job creation. Jobs in computer and information technology as a whole are expected to grow 11% from 2019 through 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. Specifically in the software space, jobs are expected to grow by 22% through 2029, must faster than the average. To quote Marc Andreessen, software is eating the world.

Software companies create and build different programs that assist companies and individuals to solve key problems. Software companies are offering products and services in almost all walks of human life, including finance, entertainment, education, shopping, sports, military and healthcare. The coronavirus crisis fueled growth in the industry as companies scrambled to move their operations online: schools needed education software; retailers looked for ways to increase their online sales; banks started creating secure and user-friendly apps to allow customers perform their transactions by staying at home; and governments increased their IT spending to get rid of age-old ways of doing business.

IT jobs pay higher than most of the jobs in other industries. IT companies are also giving a boost to overall productivity. These factors are pushing GDP growth in the U.S. A report by the BSA Foundation shows that the software industry accounted for $1.6 trillion of the total $20.5 trillion U.S. GDP in 2018.

Story continues 15 Fastest-Growing Software Companies

The growth of software companies could be gauged from the fact that The Big Five — Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) — had a combined valuation of $3.3 trillion, and accounted for about 40% of the value of the Nasdaq 100, as of 2017. Other than these giants, software companies like Salesforce, Shopify, Palantir, ServiceNow, PayPal, Square and Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO) are posting explosive growth numbers as well. The core reason for this growth and dominance is the fact that these companies are solving key problems and offering solutions that are full of value. In the words of legendary investor Peter Thiel, they have become monopolies by virtue of the value and satisfaction they give to their customers. Software companies also grow fast because they have low marginal costs and big potential to scale.

In this article, we will be ranking fastest-growing software companies based on their revenue and headcount growth. Let's start:

We have since been impressed with the company’s ability to navigate the tough macro environment, and oil prices have improved. We believe it has been able to deliver very attractive growth despite the macro uncertainty, giving us more confidence to start a position during the quarter. We think the company has an outstanding competitive position, a highly recurring business model, robust margins and returns, and a management team that exhibits all the behaviors that we seek, especially value-creating reinvestment.”

RV Capital in their Q4 2020 investor letter said that they saw a spectacular value in Slack Technologies, Inc. and acquired a position in the company. Here is what RV Capital stated:

""We became co-owners in Slack, a channels-based communication service for businesses. In an unexpected twist, a few months later it was acquired by Salesforce.com at roughly a 50% premium to what we had paid.

In accordance with my usual practice, I was planning on writing about our investment in Slack. By laying out my investment hypothesis at the onset of an investment, I hope to enable investors to assess in hindsight whether it worked (or not) because of a plausible investment philosophy consistently applied. Given that Slack has effectively already played out as an investment, this rationale has gone. After all, anyone can make a successful investment decision look smart after the fact.

There is one element of my Slack investment thesis that I would like to lay out as it neatly illustrates an idea in my first-half letter and has not yet played out. I wrote then that I wanted to invest more in “early-stage, listed companies”. What I meant by this are companies whose moat is not yet fully developed, but not so undeveloped that it is difficult to say if they will ever have one. I described early-stage companies as possessing:

The kernel of an idea (however unformed), which – if you squint – you can imagine creating a new paradigm in decades to come.

Slack was the type of company I had in mind when I wrote this. Its moat in its core business of providing channels-based communication within companies is well developed. It benefits from a network effect (the more employees on Slack, the higher the value they derive from it), a broad developer ecosystem (thousands of integrations have been built for Slack) and switching costs (Slack becomes tightly interwoven into a company’s workflow through said integrations).

What really got me excited – the new paradigm – is “Slack Connect”. Connect is a feature that allows companies to extend Slack beyond their own organisation to external partners. Connect has not yet achieved viral growth – the moat is not yet developed.”

7. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE: VEEV)

Revenue(2015): $313 million

Revenue(2020): $1 billion

Employees: 3,501

Alger Small Cap Focus Fund in their Q3 2020 investor letter highlighted a few stocks and Veeva Systems Inc is one of them. Here is what Alger Small Cap Focus Fund stated:

""Veeva Systems is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for the global life sciences industry. Veeva’s key solutions are Commercial Cloud products, offering multi-channel customer relationship management software, and Veeva Vault, offering regulated content management for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Shares of Veeva performed strongly after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal second quarter 2021 results and raised its fiscal-year 2021 earnings and billings guidance. Veeva’s key growth driver continues to be strong adoption of Veeva Vault, with particular strength in the fiscal second quarter in its Quality Suite and Clinical Trial Management system. Veeva is making good progress on its recent acquisitions of Crossix, which provides a platform for optimizing health care marketing, and Physicians World. which provides a physicians’ speaker bureau. Since the earlier days of the pandemic in March, Veeva has offered its Veeva CRM Engage products to life sciences customers for free to enable virtual sales visits. Veeva intends to convert a large portion of these new customers into annual subscription contracts next year, as virtual selling has become more important during Covid-19. Finally, Veeva announced the formation of a board committee to explore the conversion of Veeva into a for-profit public-benefit corporation. Veeva would be the first public company to make this change. We believe this potential change would align well with Veeva’s existing culture and operations, that Veeva will still have the legal duty to maximize shareholder value and that the change could potentially create greater trust in Veeva to properly handle proprietary customer data.”

119,2021-02-11T06:07:01+00:00,Clubhouse Mania Drove $6 Billion to This Loss-Making Chinese Startup,"(Bloomberg) -- Clubhouse has in just two months become the venue of choice for luminaries like Elon Musk or Drake to expound on everything from telepathic monkeys to stock market valuations. But the real winner of the audio-chat app’s stratospheric rise is a loss-making Shanghai startup called Agora Inc.

Agora, known mostly within tech circles as an industrious but low-profile provider of software tools, has soared more than 150% since mid-January when online chatter began to circulate about how it powers the world’s hottest new social media forum. That’s because the little-known company -- now worth almost $10 billion -- provides developers with all they need to build real-time voice and video functions within applications: a template known as a software development kit.

Agora -- ancient Greek for a forum or market -- has been linked publicly since its IPO last summer to Clubhouse, though it remains unclear the extent to which the red-hot social media forum employed its software kit. Decompiling the Clubhouse app reveals Agora’s name in the code, meaning Clubhouse is using at least part of the Chinese firm’s SDK, according to two engineers familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because taking software code apart violates Apple’s iOS user policies.

Clubhouse’s co-founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, have said in conversations on the app that they use Agora, according to two people who heard those discussions but asked not to be named because Clubhouse doesn’t talk publicly about its tech stack. And in an experiment this week, German software engineer Andreas Lehr told Bloomberg News he analyzed traffic coming out of his phone while connected to Clubhouse and noticed several calls out to agora.io.

Beyond just powering Agora’s stock price however, that amorphous link is beginning to spur concerns about the security of the app. It’s the same vague fear that attaches itself to the largest of companies from TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. to unheard-of outfits: that Beijing has the power to not just demand they hand over data at will, but also compel Chinese companies to spy on its behalf. Agora declined to comment on its relationship with Clubhouse but said in a statement it takes privacy and security seriously.

Story continues

“Just like in the case of Zoom, Agora still runs its centralized service in different jurisdictions,” said Suji Yan, the founder and chief executive officer of data privacy startup Mask Network, which builds a tool for users to post encrypted messages on Twitter and Facebook. “It’s hard for a public corporation like Agora not to respond to a local government’s request.”

The debate around the extent of Agora’s involvement comes even as Beijing appears to move against Clubhouse. Many of the app’s users in China say they’ve been unable to access the service since Monday, after an explosion of discussions over the weekend on taboo topics from Taiwan to Xinjiang.

But it’s the potential for surveillance that worries international users. Chinese law requires its companies to hand over information on request and even gather data on behalf of Beijing, if it’s deemed in the interests of national security. That, along with accusations from U.S. lawmakers that Chinese firms can build backdoors into devices and software for the Communist Party can exploit, is at the heart of a growing hostility toward China’s largest tech providers.

Agora’s own customizable tools run on users’ devices as part of client applications like Clubhouse. Agora co-founder Tony Wang has told media the company doesn’t store any end-user data but serves as a “pass-over.” But from a technical perspective, it does get ahold of real-time voice data that it helps transmit on Clubhouse. It won’t be able to cross-identify that with users’ mobile numbers -- which in turn unearths their real-world identities -- because such data is managed by Clubhouse itself, according to the two engineers familiar with the matter.In theory, Chinese operatives can cross-check Agora’s voice data against other voice data that does link up with real IDs -- for example, those from state-owned Chinese telecom operators -- as a way to identify activists or dissidents, said Mask Network’s Yan.

“Right now I don’t think the government would have the computing power to do so, but you can’t rule out that possibility for the future,” Yan said. “And the cross-reference of voice data bound to the same cell number will leak more data and cause more potential problems than we thought.”

Started in 2013 by software engineer Tony Zhao, Agora has grown to become one of China’s largest providers of real-time communications technology, powering big names like teaching services provider New Oriental Education & Technology Group and dating app operator The Meeting Group. It’s attracted investment from venture capital firms including SIG, Coatue Management and China’s Morningside, which is also one of the earliest backers of short-video app Kuaishou Technology.

Revenue grew 81% to $30.8 million for the September quarter, when companies outside China contributed more than 20% of sales, executives told analysts during a post-earnings call in November.

Agora itself highlighted China’s complex internet regulatory regime as a risk factor in its IPO prospectus, adding it may be required to take further steps to comply with the European Union’s GDPR privacy laws or regulations elsewhere. It currently offer products in more than 100 countries.

Still, speculation about Clubhouse’s Chinese roots hasn’t hurt its global popularity for now, nor has Beijing’s actions.

“The Chinese-language discussions I heard over the last week were remarkable in that they touched on issues that are heavily censored in China, while allowing open discussion across the Chinese border,” said Graham Webster of the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center.

Hardware in tech terms refers to the physical parts of a computer and related devices. It can be categorized into internal hardware (motherboards, RAM, HDD, SSD, graphic cards, power supply) and external hardware (monitor, keyboard, scanner, printer). Hardware refers to the tangible parts of a computer device needed to store and run the software. The hardware is the delivery platform of the written instructions provided by the software. On the other hand, the software is intangible which consists of operating systems, programs, and applications that need to be installed on the computer. You can check out the 15 biggest software companies in the world on a separate list.

Computer hardware industry experienced a massive growth over the course of a century. In 1946, the first computer, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built in the U.S. It weighed more than 27 tons and had over 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays. Today, massive computing power has been narrowed down to chips the size of pins.

In the last few years, the tech hardware sector has faced major shifts in areas such as graphics processing and virtual reality. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as the next major trend in the computer market with the potential to establish an impact across the business spectrum. IoT and AI will fuel the demand for hardware companies. Data from McKinsey shows that by 2025, AI-related semiconductors could account for about 20% of the total hardware demand. This translates into $67 billion in revenue.  5 Biggest Tech Hardware Companies in the World

According to research firm Gartner, worldwide PC shipments increased 9% year over year in the third quarter of 2020. Overall, PC shipments jumped 3.6% to 71.4 million units in the third quarter, fueled by a 11.4% rise in U.S. This was the first time in a decade that the region saw a double-digit growth.

The global computer hardware market is anticipated to grow from $862.93 billion in 2020 to $944.09 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4%. North America was the largest region in the global market for computer hardware, accounting for 43% of the market in 2020. The tech hardware market is expected to be powered by a rapid increase in investment in smart city projects in many countries around the world. Smart city innovations use information and communication technologies to organize urban services efficiently, including transport systems, water supply, and law and order.

Hardware in tech terms refers to the physical parts of a computer and related devices. It can be categorized into internal hardware (motherboards, RAM, HDD, SSD, graphic cards, power supply) and external hardware (monitor, keyboard, scanner, printer). Hardware refers to the tangible parts of a computer device needed to store and run the software. The hardware is the delivery platform of the written instructions provided by the software. On the other hand, the software is intangible which consists of operating systems, programs, and applications that need to be installed on the computer. You can check out the 15 biggest software companies in the world on a separate list.

Computer hardware industry experienced a massive growth over the course of a century. In 1946, the first computer, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built in the U.S. It weighed more than 27 tons and had over 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays. Today, massive computing power has been narrowed down to chips the size of pins.

In the last few years, the tech hardware sector has faced major shifts in areas such as graphics processing and virtual reality. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as the next major trend in the computer market with the potential to establish an impact across the business spectrum. IoT and AI will fuel the demand for hardware companies. Data from McKinsey shows that by 2025, AI-related semiconductors could account for about 20% of the total hardware demand. This translates into $67 billion in revenue.  5 Biggest Tech Hardware Companies in the World

124,2021-02-10T20:25:32+00:00,Who Will Build the Apple Car? Here Are Candidates to Watch,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s work on a car has brought to the fore several potential manufacturing partners capable of building an electric self-driving vehicle for the technology giant.

The secret project has gained momentum in recent months, adding multiple former Tesla Inc. executives, gaining the supervision of Apple’s top artificial intelligence executive and ramping up road tests. The initiative, known as Project Titan inside Apple, is attracting intense interest because of its potential to upend the automotive industry and supply chains, much like the iPhone did to the smartphone market.

Read more: Apple’s Car Is at Least Half a Decade Away

If and when Apple commits to building a car, it is likely to seek multiple partners -- including a major one to assemble the vehicle and many others to supply key components. The following companies -- whose representatives declined to comment -- are possible candidates:

Foxconn

Foxconn Technology Group already has a close relationship with Apple. For well over a decade, it has been the U.S. company’s largest production partner, assembling the majority of the world’s iPhones and a big chunk of its Macs and iPads from vast complexes employing upwards of a million people across China.

In October, Foxconn, whose main listed arm is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., unveiled its first electric-vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. It also plans to release a solid-state battery by 2024.The Taiwanese company, founded by billionaire Terry Gou, announced a plan in early 2020 to form a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler to develop and make electric vehicles in China, though Foxconn won’t be involved in any assembly itself.In January, Foxconn signed a manufacturing deal with Chinese EV startup Byton Ltd. with the goal of starting mass production of its M-Byte model by the first quarter of 2022. It also announced another venture with China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to provide production and consulting services.

Story continues

Magna

Magna, based in Ontario, Canada, is the third-largest auto supplier in the world by sales, and has a contract-manufacturing operation with years of experience making entire car models for a variety of auto brands.

Magna produces everything from chassis and car seats to sensors and software for driver-assistance features. Automakers including BMW AG and Jaguar Land Rover have hired its Magna Steyr unit and outsourced production to its factory in Graz, Austria.Magna also pitches its engineering and manufacturing services to EV startups. Last fall, it agreed to provide Fisker Inc. with an EV platform for its Ocean SUV and added self-driving features to the deal in January.In December, Magna put about $450 million into a joint venture with Korea’s LG Electronics Inc. to make EV powertrains. It’s also expanding its manufacturing footprint in China, the largest EV market, by building the ArcFox Alpha-T for Beijing Automotive Group Co. -- the first vehicle it’s assembled outside of Europe.It also has the benefit of a prior relationship with Apple: the two were in talks to build Apple’s car when the iPhone maker first set out on this path about five years ago.

Hyundai or Kia

Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. have drawn the most attention so far this year, thanks in part to Hyundai initially confirming reports in Korea last month that it was in discussions with Apple. But the carmaker quickly walked that back and recently repeated that it wasn’t in talks.

Hyundai and Kia both have plants in the U.S., in Alabama and Georgia. Their dedicated EV platform will deliver driving range of over 500 kilometers (311 miles) and be capable of recharging car batteries up to 80% in 18 minutes.While the two sell EVs derived from existing models, they will start selling vehicles based on the dedicated EV platform from March, helping to bring down costs and improve performance efficiency. They plan to introduce a combined 23 new EV models and sell 1 million units globally by 2025.The big disadvantage Hyundai and Kia have is the recent back-and-forth on whether they are developing a car for Apple, a notoriously secretive company. Although the two automakers have said talks aren’t happening, it’s possible discussions could restart if Apple deems them the best possible partners.

Nissan

Although it’s seen as a long shot, Nissan Motor Co. brings several elements to the table that could be beneficial for Apple.

Nissan already has a common EV platform developed with French partner Renault SA, which will be used for its Ariya compact SUV debuting later this year. When asked whether the Japanese company would be willing to build cars for Apple, CEO Makoto Uchida said during an earnings news conference that Nissan “has the DNA to do things others won’t do.”The automaker has been mired in a slump, reporting its biggest loss in two decades in fiscal 2019, and could get much-needed revenue from helping Apple develop or manufacture its vehicle. It also could benefit from access to Apple’s technology.After pursuing a strategy of volume at any cost that ate into profit, Nissan needs to attract higher-paying customers largely with the technology inside of its cars.

Stellantis

One factor in determining the suitability of a partner for Apple may be availability of production capacity. This could point to European automakers such as Stellantis NV, which has been hit by the region’s sales slump and has spare room in some plants.

Stellantis is under pressure to find synergies after forming last month through the merger of PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler.Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said during a Jan. 19 press conference that Stellantis is open to working with Apple or any tech company on EVs, “as long as it doesn’t create any technology dependence” that would jeopardize the automaker’s future.Chairman John Elkann said in 2016 that the auto industry should work with “new industry participants” like Google and Apple rather than try to compete with them.

They plan to introduce a combined 23 new EV models and sell 1 million units globally by 2025.The big disadvantage Hyundai and Kia have is the recent back-and-forth on whether they are developing a car for Apple, a notoriously secretive company. Although the two automakers have said talks aren’t happening, it’s possible discussions could restart if Apple deems them the best possible partners.

Nissan

Although it’s seen as a long shot, Nissan Motor Co. brings several elements to the table that could be beneficial for Apple.

Nissan already has a common EV platform developed with French partner Renault SA, which will be used for its Ariya compact SUV debuting later this year. When asked whether the Japanese company would be willing to build cars for Apple, CEO Makoto Uchida said during an earnings news conference that Nissan “has the DNA to do things others won’t do.”The automaker has been mired in a slump, reporting its biggest loss in two decades in fiscal 2019, and could get much-needed revenue from helping Apple develop or manufacture its vehicle. It also could benefit from access to Apple’s technology.After pursuing a strategy of volume at any cost that ate into profit, Nissan needs to attract higher-paying customers largely with the technology inside of its cars.

Stellantis

One factor in determining the suitability of a partner for Apple may be availability of production capacity. This could point to European automakers such as Stellantis NV, which has been hit by the region’s sales slump and has spare room in some plants.

Stellantis is under pressure to find synergies after forming last month through the merger of PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler.Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said during a Jan. 19 press conference that Stellantis is open to working with Apple or any tech company on EVs, “as long as it doesn’t create any technology dependence” that would jeopardize the automaker’s future.Chairman John Elkann said in 2016 that the auto industry should work with “new industry participants” like Google and Apple rather than try to compete with them.

126,2021-02-10T14:17:02+00:00,"Skyworks, Harley-Davidson, Apple, Amazon and Google highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – February 10, 2021 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. SWKS as the Bull of the Day, Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

The 4th Industrial Revolution is upon us, and connectivity is becoming a central focus as 5G technology rolls out. Skyworks and its growing portfolio of digitally connected chips are essential components to the 'smart' world we live in.

Today almost everything we interact with is digitally linked to the internet, also known as the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem. 4G networks weren't built to handle the volume of data or required speed of this rapidly expanding ecosystem of connected devices. The 5G revolution is an essential transition to allow our increasingly 'smart' world to function in real-time.

Skyworks' cutting-edge chip technology is critical for the ushering out of 5G devices, and this past quarterly report really illustrated the vitality of this enterprise. The company's vision of Connecting Everyone and Everything, All the Time is coming to fruition, and analysts are getting excited. Analysts have been significantly raising their EPS estimates across every time horizon, propelling SWKS to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Recent Earnings Report

Skyworks had an exceptionally strong earnings report to round out what will go down as one of the craziest years in history. The business illustrated a blowout quarter, with an enormous top & bottom-line beat in addition to increased forward guidance that had analysts racing to boost their price targets.

The innovation-driven enterprise reported record revenues of over $1.5 billion in its December quarter, up 69% from the prior year. Skyworks has never had a more profitable quarter with $516 million on the bottom-line, illustrating nearly 100% expansion compared to last year's December quarter results.

Story continues

The new 5G iPhone release, along with other leading 5G devices, have been a sizable tailwind for the business. Skyworks' Sky5 chip portfolio is accelerating with next-generation 5G, ""supporting the next wave of 5G launches at Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other Tier-1 players"" (aka Apple, its #1 customer), according to the quarterly release.

In its earnings call, President & CEO Liam Griffin said that the company was dedicated to investing more in its own fabs (aka internal manufacturing) to keep up with the swelling chip demand. The company ended the year with $1 billion in cash & equivalents, no debt, and an over $1 billion run rate in post-dividend free-cash-flows giving the enterprise enormous financial flexibility for internal investment (which the business has continuously done), and synergy driving acquisitions.

What's Next For SWKS

SWKS shares surged to fresh highs following this unbelievable quarter, with the stock trading in a range between roughly $170 - $190 since this report was released. The markets are still digesting the earnings news, but it would appear that this stock still has some legs to rally.

Skyworks is spending the money to continue growing its footprint in fabrication, so the business doesn't have to rely too heavily on external manufacturing. The company has been investing heavily in internal development of 5G chips for the IoT explosion that has already begun and SWKS is just beginning to see the benefits.

SWKS is expected to see a 68% EPS improvement in its fiscal 2021 (ending September 30th), on top of a 47% increase in revenues.

SWKS remains at a relative discount despite its nearly 20% price surge since its earnings report at the end of January. The stock is trading at a price to 12-month forward earnings of 17.4x compared to the tech sector's 29x.

I am very bullish on SWKS positioning in the marketplace, with a nearly 25% market share in RF chips for smartphones. The company is well-positioned for the commencing IoT & 5G revolution. 14 out of 22 analysts are calling this stock a buy today with no sell ratings. Its most optimistic price target represents a 36% upside, which I believe is very attainable after that stellar earnings report at the end of January.

Bear of the Day:

Harley-Davidson is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a popular motorcycle manufacturer. The company operates in two segments, Motorcycles and Related Products and Financial Services. The motorcycle segment represents 80% of their revenues and is the primary driver of earnings growth.

Unfortunately for investors, there wasn't much growth this past quarter. The company disappointed on EPS and the stock was crushed. As we approach the summer driving season, investors are left with hope that the motorcycle consumer will come back strong with their stimulus checks. However, there might be more of a fundamental issue at hand.

More about HOG

Harley-Davidson is an iconic American brand that was founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The company is valued around $5 billion and has a PE of 14. HOG has Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" in Value but ""D"" in Growth. Harley pays a small dividend of 0.24%.

There is no questioning Harley's influence in Americana over the years, but that doesn't help its stock price today. Earnings last week forced the stock over 20% lower the day they reported.

Q4 Earnings

Before this quarter, Harley has missed on EPS only twice since 2019. The surprise miss last week wasn't necessarily surprising, but the magnitude was, with a 730% EPS miss. The company lost 44 cents instead of the expected +.10 and revenues came in below expectations as well. Both U.S. and international sales were down year after year and the operating margin hurt, coming in at -37% vs the -5.3% last year.

While the numbers may seem like a disaster, the company unveiled ""The Hardwire"" a five-year strategic plan that will target profitable growth and brand desirability. In this plan the company will target low double-digit EPS growth through 2025 by broadening the view of its customer, investing in core segments and strengthening its commitment to electric motorcycles.

Management obviously has identified the issues and had comments going forward:

""The entire Harley-Davidson team put forth tremendous effort in 2020 and we now have the right organization, structure and strategy in place to make step changes in our performance and enhance our position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world.""

While there is a plan, analysts and investors might not be on board yet. The company will have to prove itself in upcoming quarters as for now, estimates are falling.

Estimates

The quarter forced estimates lower over all time frames. The last 7 days have seen next quarters estimates fall from $1.20 to $0.90, or 20%. For the current year, estimates dropped from $2.76 to $2.34, or 15%.

The drop in estimates led to price cuts from Wedbush ($42 from $45) and BMO ($40 from $46).

A Fundamental Issue

The motorcycle industry has gone through hard years as late, with sluggish sales being blamed on more risk-averse millennials. There simply aren't enough new riders to replace the older riders that supported the industry for so long. Motorcycles simply aren't as cool as they used to be. For those with the disposable income that might have taken up the idea thirty years ago, they are not riding or buying into the brand.

But perhaps the end of COVID might change everything. The idea of getting out on the road after being stuck in your house for a year might sound great for some new customers. Harley and other motorcycle companies need to market and sell that idea if they want to change the trend away from bikes.

The Technicals

The chart looked great before earnings, but the down move broke some key levels. The $30 area is the 200-day Moving average and investors that think the company can turn things around should eyeball that level. Back over $40 would indicate the bulls know something the bears don't, so let's assume if the stock can get back there, The Hardwire plan is working

In Summary

It's going to take a while for the company to prove itself, so for now investors should consider this stock dead money. It is hard not to root for a brand like Harley, as the iconic American image has so much value in itself. Everyone loves a turnaround story, but be patient with this one.

127,2021-02-10T14:02:02+00:00,5 ROE Stocks to Profit as Markets Soar on New Stimulus Hope,"The U.S. equity markets are currently trading near record-high territories on broad-based expectations that the Congress will approve President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. The monetary and fiscal support is likely to provide added cushion to revitalize the economy against a slower-than-expected job addition amid the virus outbreak. In addition, declining cases of fresh COVID-19 infections and relatively healthy quarterly performance from hitherto reported companies have instilled market confidence.  

As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return.

Why ROE?

ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity

ROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.

Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Screening Parameters

In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.

Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.

Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.

5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screen:

CDW Corporation CDW: Headquartered in Vernon Hills, IL, CDW Corporation is a leading provider of integrated information technology solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. This Zacks #2 Ranked company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.1%. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 11.1%, on average.

Apple Inc. AAPL: Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. The company also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBook and HomePod that are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.5%, on average, and has long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.5%. Apple currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW: Founded in 1937 and headquartered in Baltimore, T. Rowe is a global investment management organization that provides a broad array of mutual funds, sub-advisory services and separate account management for individual and institutional investors, retirement plans and financial intermediaries. This Zacks #2 Ranked company pulled off a trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 5.5%, on average. It has long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.8%.

129,2021-02-10T11:00:19+00:00,Microsoft CEO's Take on Tech's Clout: `Big by Itself Is Not Bad’,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said social-media services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube need clearer laws and rules to govern whether controversial accounts, like former U.S. President Donald Trump’s, have a place on their services, rather than being asked to make free-speech decisions themselves.

“Unilateral action by individual companies in democracies like ours is just not long-term stable—we do need to be able to have a framework of laws and norms,” Nadella said in a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “Depending on any one individual CEO in any one of these companies to make calls that are going to really help us maintain something as sacred and as important as our democracy in the long run is just no way that at least I, as a citizen, would advocate for.”

Microsoft doesn’t currently run a consumer social media service, but it is among cloud-computing providers that have been pulled into the debate over the deplatforming of certain individual voices, social-media accounts and entire apps, especially following the violent pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its hosting services from Parler LLC, a social network that touts itself as anti-censorship and was popular among conservative and extremist figures. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google previously had removed Parler from their app stores. The three tech companies’ actions essentially took the service offline. Trump’s account, meantime, was banned from Twitter Inc. and remains suspended on Facebook Inc.

In the past several years, antitrust regulators have ramped up investigations into the market power of large technology companies, just as Microsoft fell under government scrutiny and faced a U.S. antitrust lawsuit more than two decades ago, when Nadella was a rising manager. It’s better for the younger technology companies to face robust competition and handle negative consequences of growing too big ahead of time, rather than waiting until their size leads to problems for consumers and rivals, the CEO said.

Story continues

“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”

The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said.

“There is no God-given right for U.S. tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said. “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.

Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”

“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”

The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said.

“There is no God-given right for U.S. tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said. “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.

Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”

133,2021-02-09T13:01:01+00:00,Contactless Payments Gaining Traction: 5 Stocks to Watch,"The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way transactions have been done so far. Social distancing to avoid contracting the deadly coronavirus has seen an increasing number of people opting for newer modes of transaction. This has seen contactless payment gaining traction.

And with almost a year into the pandemic, more than 50% of Americans are considering digital-only banks, according to a new survey by Juniper Research. Contactless payment services have not only emerged as the most convenient way to make transactions but also are likely to grow in the future given that the virus scare is far from over.

More People Prefer Digital-Only Banks

According to the new report by Juniper Research, published in which-50.com, the digital-only trend is being observed across the globe. The report states that 60% of consumers have shifted to contactless payment services because of fears of COVID-19.

Although OEM Pay had a head start in the United States, not too many people were using contactless cards despite having the facility. However, following the coronavirus outbreak, 89% of the contactless payment users in the country have started using contactless cards. Of those who are still not using them, 35% plan to start soon.

OEM pay solutions have gained prominence over the past few months. Today 89% of the customers, who use contactless payment options, have at least one OEM Pay solution. This shows the rapid growth in the use of OEM pay solutions in the country.

Contactless Payment Here to Stay

Although options for contactless payments have been present in the United States for a quite long time, the sudden surge happened only after the coronavirus outbreak. Till some time back, the nation was a laggard in terms of contactless preference, with only 24% using it, according to a report by global data and insights firm Dynata. That may, however, change fast as businesses are rapidly adopting contactless transactions keeping safety in mind.

Story continues

The surge in users of contactless cards and other touch-free options have been working miracles for companies offering these services. The coronavirus fears have not only compelled people to use contactless payment but also changed their behavioral pattern, as many now want to continue with this mode.

134,2021-02-09T11:41:45+00:00,Apple Partner Wistron to Restart Riot-Hit iPhone Factory in India,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s manufacturing partner Wistron Corp. will hire workers and restart operations in its Narasapura factory outside Bangalore after a violent protest shut the iPhone-manufacturing facility last December.Apple’s teams and independent auditors have been working with Wistron over the past eight weeks to put the necessary systems and processes in place, the Cupertino-based iPhone maker said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. However, the Taiwanese contractor will continue to face scrutiny.

“A comprehensive set of corrective actions has now been completed and Wistron has restructured their recruiting team and enhanced training and support for workers,” Apple said in the statement. “Wistron remains on probation and we will monitor their progress closely.”

Apple had suspended new orders to Wistron in December after workers who had been hired on monthly pay of about $200 stormed the factory and rioted over unpaid salaries, destroying furniture and equipment leading to losses worth millions of dollars. The incident underscored the challenges to Apple as the world’s most valuable company seeks to expand its India business while diversifying its supply chain beyond China.

All workers in the facility will undergo a new training program to ensure they understand their rights and how to raise concerns, Apple said in the statement. Its representatives will remain on site to validate that the new processes are effective.

Wistron didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio), the co-CEO of Markel Corp., disclosed his fourth-quarter 2020 portfolio late last week.

Concentrating on promising areas where Markel has good understanding and knowledge, the guru's Virginia-based firm uses a value-oriented approach to stock picking. Gayner also maintains a margin of safety within the investment portfolio and believes that since a stock is part of a business, it is worth what the present value of future cash flows are.

Keeping these ideas in mind, the guru established small positions in IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC) and Allstate Corp. (NYSE:ALL) during the quarter. Gayner's most notable trades for the three months ended Dec. 31, however, were reductions in the Rollins Inc. (NYSE:ROL) and Mohawk Industries Inc. (NYSE:MHK) holdings as well as additions to investments in International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF), Healthcare Services Group Inc. (NASDAQ:HCSG) and SEI Investments Co. (NASDAQ:SEIC).

Rollins

With an impact of -0.25% on the equity portfolio, the investor curbed his stake in Rollins by 33.33%, selling 621,637 shares. The stock traded for an average price of $38.80 per share during the quarter.

Gayner now holds 1.24 million shares total, which represent 0.72% of the equity portfolio. GuruFocus estimates he has gained 169.26% on the investment since establishing it in the fourth quarter of 2013. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

The Atlanta-based pest control company, which owns the Orkin brand, among several others, has an $18.57 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $37.57 on Monday with a price-earnings ratio of 71.26, a price-book ratio of 19.72 and a price-sales ratio of 8.59.

The Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overpriced. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 1 out of 10 aligns with this assessment.

Story continues Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

GuruFocus rated Rollins' financial strength 7 out of 10, driven by a comfortable level of interest coverage and a robust Altman Z-Score of 14.81 that indicates the company is in good standing even though its assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing. The return on invested capital also surpasses the weighted average cost of capital, indicating good value creation.

The company's profitability fared even better, scoring a 9 out of 10 rating. Although the operating margin is in decline, it, along with strong returns on equity, assets and capital, outperform a majority of competitors. Rollins also has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 5, which indicates business conditions are stable, while consistent revenue and earnings growth contributed to a predictability rank of five out of five stars. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return an average of 12.1% annually over a 10-year period.

Of the gurus invested in Rollins, Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) has the largest stake with 0.6% of outstanding shares. Other top guru shareholders include Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio) and Caxton Associates (Trades, Portfolio).

Mohawk Industries

Impacting the equity portfolio by -0.12%, Gayner trimmed his position in Mohawk Industries by 25.08%, selling 74,000 shares. Shares traded for an average price of $120.85 each during the quarter.

He now holds 221,000 shares total, which account for 0.46% of the equity portfolio. GuruFocus data shows Gayner has gained an estimated 5.44% on the investment since the third quarter of 2018. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

According to the Peter Lynch chart, the stock is overvalued. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 8 out of 10, however, leans more toward undervaluation. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

Mohawk's financial strength was rated 6 out of 10 by GuruFocus. Despite having adequate interest coverage, the Altman Z-Score of 2.96 indicates the company is under some pressure since assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing. The WACC also eclipses the ROIC, indicating issues with creating value.

The company's profitability scored a 7 out of 10 rating even though its operating margin is in decline and its returns underperform over half of its industry peers. Mohawk is also being supported by a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 5, but the 3.5-star predictability rank is on watch as a result of revenue per share declining over the past 12 months. GuruFocus says companies with this rank return an average of 9.3% annually.

With a 2.67% stake, Richard Pzena (Trades, Portfolio) is Mohawk's largest guru shareholder. John Rogers (Trades, Portfolio), Charles Brandes (Trades, Portfolio), Third Avenue Management (Trades, Portfolio), the Third Avenue Value Fund (Trades, Portfolio), Robert Olstein (Trades, Portfolio), Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio), Pioneer, Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio), Simons' firm, Ruane Cunniff (Trades, Portfolio) and Jeremy Grantham (Trades, Portfolio) also own the stock.

The guru now holds 146,000 shares total, which make up 0.24% of the equity portfolio. GuruFocus data shows he has gained an estimated 2.04% on the investment so far. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

The New York-based company, which produces value-added ingredients like flavors, fragrances and cosmetic actives, has a $31.57 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $126.82 on Monday with a price-earnings ratio of 37.99, a price-book ratio of 2.38 and a price-sales ratio of 2.83.

Based on the Peter Lynch chart, the stock appears to be overvalued. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 4 out of 10 aligns with this analysis. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

GuruFocus rated International Flavors & Fragrances' financial strength 5 out of 10. Despite having insufficient interest coverage and assets that are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing, the company is being supported by a high Altman Z-Score of 3.82. However, the company is also struggling to create value as the ROIC is below the WACC.

The company's profitability scored an 8 out of 10 rating even though margins are in decline and returns are underperforming over half of its competitors. International Flavors & Fragrances also has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 4, but due to a slowdown in revenue per share growth over the past year, its three-star predictability rank is on watch. GuruFocus says companies with this rank return an average of 8.2% annually.

Pioneer is the company's largest guru shareholder with a 1.37% stake. Gabelli, Simons' firm, Dalio, Murray Stahl (Trades, Portfolio), Greenblatt and Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) also own the stock.

The guru now holds 782,500 shares total, accounting for 0.33% of the equity portfolio. He has gained an estimated 12.63% on the investment since the first quarter of 2017 according to GuruFocus. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

Headquartered in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania, the company, which provides housekeeping and facility management services to the health care industry, has a market cap of $2.5 billion; its shares were trading around $33.55 on Monday with a price-earnings ratio of 28.01, a price-book ratio of 5.37 and a price-sales ratio of 1.42.

The Peter Lynch chart suggests the stock is overvalued, but the GuruFocus valuation rank of 9 out of 10 leans more toward undervaluation. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

Healthcare Services' financial strength and profitability were both rated 8 out of 10 by GuruFocus. In addition to comfortable interest coverage, the company is supported by a high Altman Z-Score of 8.89. Assets, however, are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing. The ROIC also surpasses the WACC, indicating good value creation.

The company also has an expanding operating margin, strong returns that are outperforming a majority of industry peers and a high Piotroski F-Score of 7, which implies business conditions are healthy. Healthcare Services also has a one-star predictability rank despite seeing a decline in revenue per share over the past year. GuruFocus says companies with this rank return an average of 1.1% annually.

Gayner is the company's largest guru shareholder with a 1.05% holding. Chuck Royce (Trades, Portfolio), Greenblatt, Caxton and Pioneer also own the stock.

The Oaks, Pennsylvania-based financial services company has an $8.05 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $56.28 on Monday with a price-earnings ratio of 18.66, a price-book ratio of 4.72 and a price-sales ratio of 4.96.

The Peter Lynch chart suggests the stock is overvalued, but the GuruFocus valuation rank of 8 out of 10 indicates it is undervalued. Tom Gayner's Top 5 Trades of the 4th Quarter

SEI Investments' financial strength and profitability were both rated 9 out of 10 by GuruFocus. In addition to strong interest coverage, the robust Altman Z-Score of 16.19 indicates the company is in good standing even though assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing.

The company also has an expanding operating margin, strong returns that outperform a majority of competitors and a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 6. Despite having consistent earnings and revenue growth, the five-star predictability rank is on watch.

138,2021-02-08T21:12:11+00:00,Only one US stock has done better than Amazon in the Jeff Bezos era,"Jeff Bezos, president and CEO of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, speaks at the Economic Club of Washington DC in 2018

With Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO of Amazon.com, let’s reflect on the company’s performance under his management. While he’s only a stock tick or two away from being the richest person in the world, during his tenure Amazon’s stock market results come in a distant second to Monster Beverage, the energy drink maker.

Amazon’s stock performance since IPO

Why don’t we have an ideal mask yet?

A $1,000 investment in Amazon’s stock at its IPO on May 15, 1997, would be worth $2.2 million today. A $1,000 investment in Hansen’s Natural Corp—what Monster was called in 1997—would be worth $3.9 million. A distant third is Apple, where those $1,000 in shares would be worth $1.1 million today. These calculations include stock splits and the reinvestment of dividends, though Monster and Amazon didn’t issue any payments to investors during the time period.

Amazon’s changing business model

China is marching closer to a population crisis

Amazon’s business has expanded significantly since its market debut. At the time, it reported $15.7 million in annual sales and Dow Jones Newswires described the company as “an upstart that made a flashy business out of selling books over the Internet.” In 2020, the company made $386 billion in sales while operating its own multi-national parcel-delivery fleet, offering services to control satellites, and running a streaming entertainment platform.

Monster Beverage’s outsized profits

Hansen’s $1.3 million of profit on $43 million sales in 1997 came primarily from carbonated fruit-juice drinks made without additives like caffeine or artificial coloring. The intervening years have led it to sell off non-energy drink divisions to Coca-Cola, change its name to Monster, and grow profit to a cumulative $1.2 billion on $4.4 billion in sales in its four most recently reported quarters.

Though still at least a decade away from becoming reality, 6G — which could be up to 100 times faster than the peak speed of 5G — could deliver the kind of technology that’s long been the stuff of science fiction, from real-time holograms to flying taxis and internet-connected human bodies and brains.

The scrum for 6G is already intensifying even as it remains a theoretical proposition, and underscores how geopolitics is fueling technological rivalries, particularly between the U.S. and China.

“This endeavor is so important that it’s become an arms race to some extent,” said Peter Vetter, head of access and devices at Nokia Oyj’s research arm Bell Labs. “It will require an army of researchers on it to remain competitive.”

Years of acrimony under the Trump administration have hit Chinese technology companies hard, but that hasn’t stopped the country from emerging as the leader in 5G. It has the world’s largest 5G footprint, and — despite multiple attempts by the U.S. to take it on — Huawei Technologies Co. towers over rival 5G vendors globally, mostly by offering attractive prices.

The development of 6G could give the U.S. the opportunity to regain lost ground in wireless technology.

“Unlike 5G, North America will not let the opportunity for a generational leadership slide by so easily this time,” said Vikrant Gandhi, senior industry director of information and communications technologies at consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan in the U.S. “It is likely that the competition for 6G leadership will be fiercer than that for 5G.”

It’s clear that 6G is already on the minds of policy makers in both Washington and Beijing. Former President Donald Trump tweeted in early 2019, for example, that he wanted 6G “as soon as possible.”

China is already moving ahead. The country launched a satellite in November to test airwaves for potential 6G transmission, and Huawei has a 6G research center in Canada, according to Canadian media reports. Telecommunications equipment manufacturer ZTE Corp. has also teamed up with China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. to develop the technology.

The U.S. has demonstrated that it has the ability to seriously handicap Chinese companies, as in the case of ZTE, which almost collapsed after the Commerce Department banned it for three months in 2018 from buying American technology. Similar moves could hamper Huawei’s 6G ambitions.

Washington has already started to sketch out the 6G battle lines. The Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, a U.S. telecom standards developer known as ATIS, launched the Next G Alliance in October to “advance North American leadership in 6G.” The alliance’s members include technology giants like Apple Inc., AT&T Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Google and Samsung Electronics Co., but not Huawei.

The alliance mirrors the way that the world has been fractured into opposing camps as a result of 5G rivalry. Led by the U.S, which identified Huawei as an espionage risk — an allegation the Chinese giant denies — countries including Japan, Australia, Sweden and the U.K. have shut the firm out of their 5G networks. However, Huawei is welcomed in Russia, the Philippines, Thailand, and other countries in Africa and the Middle East.

The European Union in December also unveiled a 6G wireless project led by Nokia, which includes companies like Ericsson AB and Telefonica SA, as well as universities.

The lack of trust in Chinese companies like Huawei is unlikely to abate with 6G. Democracies are growing increasingly worried about how 5G technology is being used by authoritarian regimes, with fears that 6G could enable technologies such as mass drone surveillance. China is already using surveillance cameras, AI, facial recognition and biometrics such as voice samples and DNA to track and control citizens.

“Currently China seems to be doing everything in terms of surveillance and suppression to make sure that they lose future markets in the U.S. and Europe,” said Paul Timmers, a senior adviser at Brussels-based think tank European Policy Centre and former director of digital society and cybersecurity at the European Commission. “This indicates that the technical approach to 6G cannot be trusted to be decoupled from state ideological objectives.”

While commercial 5G was introduced around 2019, countries are still rolling out networks and developing applications that could attract businesses and turn the technology profitable. Likewise, 6G may not reach its potential at least 15 years from now, said Gandhi of Frost & Sullivan. Only about 100 wireless carriers worldwide offer 5G services in limited areas right now.

But researchers have an ambitious vision for what the next-generation network could offer. At a potential rate of 1 terabyte per second, 6G is not only much faster, but also promises a latency — which causes lags — of 0.1 millisecond, compared to 1 millisecond, or the minimum for 5G. To achieve that, scientists are focusing on the super high frequency terahertz waves that could meet those speed and latency requirements, though there is not yet a chip capable of transmitting so much data in a second.

It still remains too early to tell whether the envisioned futuristic world defined by 6G will eventually materialize. In that theoretical world, everything in our environment will be connected to the 6G networks — not only can people communicate with things like furniture and clothes, but those gadgets can also communicate among themselves.

Major scientific obstacles abound — for example, researchers must solve the question of how airwaves traveling extremely short distances can easily penetrate materials such as water vapor or even a sheet of paper. Networks may need to be ultra-dense, with multiple base stations installed not only on every street, but also in each building or even each device people use to receive and transmit signals. That’s set to raise serious questions over health, privacy and urban design.

“Technological advances, especially those as futuristic and complex such as 6G radio communication should be developed carefully,” said Gandhi. “We believe that countries cannot start soon enough. The private sector cannot start soon enough. And that is why we already have initiatives such as the Next G Alliance.”

141,2021-02-08T12:47:14+00:00,Upstart Rises 879% as Founder Bets on Making Phones in India,"(Bloomberg) -- Almost three decades ago, Sunil Vachani borrowed $35,000 so he could start making 14-inch television sets in a rented shed outside New Delhi. It was an unconventional choice given India, though renowned for software and services, had long lagged behind in manufacturing.

Today, Vachani’s startup has grown into a sprawling electronics empire. His Dixon Technologies India Ltd. boasts a market value of more than $2.8 billion and the capacity to produce about 50 million smartphones this year. It’s an early indicator of the country’s opportunities -- and challenges -- in building a sophisticated manufacturing sector, a top priority for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

While Vachani, 52, struggled in his early days, his company’s shares surged 879% since a 2017 initial public offering through Monday’s close. Sales and profits have boomed with domestic demand for smartphones, along with India’s ambitious plans to develop its own local industry.

“This is only a start,” Vachani said in a telephone interview. “We are bringing about a mindset change that global manufacturing can happen in India.”

The founder and his siblings are now in the league of India’s billionaire families. Vachani, who controls a one-third stake worth about $939 million, just bought one of the more extravagant homes in the country -- a $20 million mansion in New Delhi’s tony Lutyens neighborhood.

Dixon’s shares rose 6% in Mumbai on Monday.

India has been plagued for decades with rickety infrastructure, heavy taxes and crushing bureaucracy. The Modi administration has tried to change the dynamic through a range of policies and incentives, with the goal of creating jobs and economic growth. Along with hefty tariffs on products like imported smartphones, the country kicked off a cash incentive program last October to encourage local producers.

That has helped spark the construction of new factories from homegrown device makers like Dixon and global contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Group and Wistron Corp. The effort has taken on new urgency with the rising tensions between the U.S. and China, and the coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted supply and underscored the risks of concentrating production in one place for phonemakers like Apple Inc.

Story continues

India still lags well behind China, making about 330 million smartphones annually compared with 1.5 billion in its larger Asian neighbor, according to the Indian Cellular Association. Yet Dixon is an example of how quickly India is changing: It has ramped up production capacity from about 2 million smartphones a month last year to about 4 million units after the government’s incentive program began, with more planned next year.

”All global companies are looking for an alternative to the world’s major manufacturing hub, China,” Vachani told Bloomberg Television on Monday.

“India is well qualified to be the world’s alternative to the China supply chain,” said P.N. Sudarshan, partner at Deloitte India. “Once component makers move, vibrant manufacturing clusters will form.”

Vachani comes from an entrepreneurial family. His father and siblings started a business that produced electronics and appliances under the Weston brand. They made the country’s first color televisions and video recorders -- and operated a string of video game parlors on the side. The Vachanis are Sindhis, a small community in India with a reputation for business acumen.

After studying business in London, Sunil opted to go his own way in 1993 rather than join the family business, a decision that quickly led to difficulty. He ran out of working capital and found banks wouldn’t lend to him without collateral. He finally landed bank financing backed by an export contract.

So desperate for business was he early on that he agreed to make his 14-inch color televisions for $1.50 in profit apiece. He later made Sega game consoles, Philips video recorders and push-button mobile phones for Bharti Airtel Ltd., the country’s leading mobile operator. Dixon’s fortunes began to improve in the 2000s, when a regional political party gave the company a contract to manufacture televisions for free distribution.

Vachani tried persuading the federal government to do more to build a domestic manufacturing sector -- mostly without success. “All I heard from policymakers was that India’s future was in software,” he said.

Investors were skeptical early on too. During Dixon’s road show ahead of its IPO, money managers argued that India simply couldn’t compete with China. Vachani eventually raised about 6 billion rupees, or $82 million.

Dixon now makes televisions for Xiaomi Corp., washing machines for LG Electronics Inc. and lighting products for Philips. It began producing mobile phones in 2016 for brands like Panasonic Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.

Phones are becoming a substantial growth market. The number of smartphone users in India is projected to rise from 468 million in 2017 to 859 million in 2022. For Dixon, mobile could account for 44% of revenues in the next fiscal year, compared with 12% last year.

The government finally turned its attention to domestic manufacturing a few years ago, aimed at slashing a massive electronics import bill and creating much-needed employment. But progress has been slow. Manufacturing accounted for 17.4% gross domestic product in 2020, nearly the same as the 15.3% in 2000, according to McKinsey & Co.

Wistron, the first Apple supplier to produce iPhones in India, ran into trouble last year when workers rioted over delays in pay. Apple put the Taiwanese company on probation and said it would hold off on providing new orders.

Modi has refined his “Make in India” policy to include financial incentives and simplified policies for infrastructure. The country has declared it wants to create 100 million new manufacturing jobs by 2022. It’s targeting a spike in phone exports from the current $7 billion to $110 billion by 2025, according to the Indian Cellular Association.

Dixon is positioning itself to get a major share of this by manufacturing and exporting globally for large brands, Vachani said. Motorola, now owned by China’s Lenovo Group Ltd., has contracted Dixon to make devices for the U.S. market. Finland’s HMD Global, which has a license for the Nokia brand, has signed a similar deal recently. By next year, the company plans to produce about 75 million mobile phones and expand into categories like tablets, laptops and wearables.“This is the golden moment for electronics manufacturing,” said Vachani. “Finally, India is the place to be.”

5 Top-Ranked Growth Stocks to Tap February's Market Rally

Wall Street has resumed its northbound journey after last week's disappointing performance that was incidentally the worst since October 2020. The primary reason for last week's extreme volatility — a typical trading practice in which a few key heavily shorted stocks by hedge fund giants were favored by a group of individual investors organized via Reddit’s wallstreetbets forum — has evaporated. Moreover, a series of good economic data and news boosted investors' confidence.

At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Notably, growth investors are primarily focused on stocks with aggressive earnings or revenue growth, which should propel their stock price higher in the future. Higher fiscal stimulus and vaccination process are likely to drive the overall growth of the economy.

Wall Street Resumes Northbound Journey

All the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — gained in each of the first four trading days of this week barring a marginal loss of Nasdaq on Feb 3. On Feb 4, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite recorded their all-time highs at 3,872.42 and 13,778.42, respectively. The Dow is just 0.7% away from its all-time high of 31,272.22 recorded on Jan 21.

Positive Economic Data and News

First, on Feb 1, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the U.S. economy will expand 4.6% in 2021 after contracting 3.5% last year. The economy is expected to reach the pre-pandemic level of February 2020 by mid-2021, much earlier than what was projected in July. In its latest projection, the Atlanta Fed estimated that the U.S. GDP will grow 6% in first-quarter 2021.

Second,  we are in the middle of the fourth-quarter 2020 earnings season, which has so far delivered better-than-expected results. As of Feb 3, total earnings of 223 S&P 500 companies were up 2.5% from the same period last year on 1.5% higher revenues.

Overall, the fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 Index are projected to be up 0.4% year over year on 2% higher revenues. This is in contrast to the projection of a 7.8% decline in earnings on 0.3% higher revenues at the beginning of the reporting cycle.

Third, the Democrats are moving forward with President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package. The proposed plan will include increasing direct payments to $2,000 from the existing $600 and supplemental unemployment benefits to $400 per week through September. The proposal also mentions that the minimum wage rate would be hiked to $15 per hour and moratoriums on eviction and foreclosure on mortgages would be extended to Sep 30.

Fourth, per the COVID Tracking Project, daily average new cases in the United States averaged 136,438 in the past week, down 30% from the average two weeks ago. As of Feb 3, there were 91,440 COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals on, down from 92,880 a day earlier and the lowest since Nov 27.

Fifth, initial jobless claims totaled 779,000 for the week ended Jan 30, lower than the consensus estimate of 837,000. Previous week's data was revised downward from 847,000 to 812,000. Initial claims fell for the third straight week and the latest data was the lowest since Nov 28.

147,2021-02-08T10:34:35+00:00,Dialog Agrees to $6 Billion Takeover by Renesas Electronics,"(Bloomberg) -- Renesas Electronics Corp. of Japan has agreed to acquire Apple Inc. supplier Dialog Semiconductor Plc, the latest U.K.-based chipmaker being sold to Asian investors.

Dialog accepted the all-cash offer of about 4.9 billion euros ($5.9 billion), at 67.50 euros per share, the companies said in statements Monday. Dialog shares rose as much as 18% in early trading in London on Monday. Renesas shares dropped as much as 6.9% in Tokyo.

The offer price is a 20% premium to Dialog’s Friday close of 56.12 euros. Shares of the company -- headquartered near London but listed in Frankfurt -- have risen around 25% since the start of the year, boosted by strong demand for Apple’s 5G handsets as well as takeover speculation.

The company had been working with advisers and was holding discussions with STMicroelectronics NV before the Franco-Italian company was outbid, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday.

“We had multiple interested parties in the acquisition of Dialog,” Jalal Bagherli, chief executive officer of Dialog, said in a call with investors on Monday. Renesas was chosen for its culture, reputation, technology and market reach, he said.

Stephane Houri, analyst at Oddo, said he doesn’t expect to see a counteroffer though the bid may need to be sweetened. The 20% premium, while acceptable given historic levels, may not represent the full value.

The volume of deals involving semiconductor companies more than doubled last year to $144 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia Corp. agreed in September to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, taking control of some of the most widely used chip technology in the industry’s largest-ever deal.

Arm, once the U.K.’s largest listed tech company, was sold to SoftBank in 2016, while chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc was sold to Chinese-backed investor Canyon Bridge Capital Partners in late 2017.

Key Terms

Dialog shareholders to receive 67.50 euros per share in cashOffer represents premium of about 20% to Dialog Friday closing priceRenesas to sell up to 270 billion yen in shares to repay Dialog debtExpected to close by the end of calendar year 2021Renesas plans to finance the transaction with bank loans of about 735.4 billion yen

Story continues

Any deal could draw scrutiny from U.K. regulators as countries grow more protective of strategic industries such as semiconductors. Nvidia’s deal for Arm is set to be investigated by the country’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority has said it will apply greater scrutiny to strategic tech deals, regardless of size.

The U.K. government is also planning to introduce new rules that would allow officials to look at past takeovers and mergers where concerns have been raised.

Renesas, which had a market value of $20.5 billion as of Friday’s close, is one of the largest suppliers of semiconductors used in cars. It also has European offices in the U.K. and Germany. In 2019, Renesas completed its acquisition of U.S. firm Integrated Device Technology Inc., a deal valued at more than $6 billion that helped it expand beyond the automotive sector.

Dialog and Renesas have been working together for over a decade. The U.K. company, which specializes in designing power management chips, said in August that it would collaborate with Renesas on car computing platforms.

Both companies have found themselves part of tensions concerning the semiconductor supply chain. Apple has grappled with a shortage of vital chips that manage power consumption in iPhones and other devices, people with knowledge of the matter said in November. Within the auto industry, a semiconductor shortage is forcing carmakers to halt production lines and is straining their relationship with chip suppliers.

Like Dialog, Renesas is also a supplier to Apple. The U.S. tech giant was reported to be in talks to buy Renesas SP Drivers, 55% owned by Renesas, in 2014. The unit, which managed LCD displays, was later sold to Synaptics Inc. for $475 million.

Renesas’s financial adviser is Nomura International Plc while Covington & Burling and Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu are its legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Qatalyst Partners are Dialog’s financial advisers and Linklaters are acting as legal counsel.

149,2021-02-08T07:45:17+00:00,"Apple Car Talks Aren’t Happening, Say Automakers Hyundai, Kia","(Bloomberg) --

Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. said that they aren’t in talks with Apple Inc. to develop an autonomous vehicle, responding to intense speculation about the potential new product by the maker of the iPhone.

Apple paused discussions with Hyundai and Kia weeks ago about building an electric vehicle, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg late last week. The Cupertino, California-based company has discussed similar plans with other auto manufacturers, the people added, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public.

The South Korean carmakers also said in regulatory filings Monday they were in talks with multiple companies about autonomous EVs, but that no decision has been made. Shares of Hyundai, which said discussions with partners were in early stages, fell 6.2% in Seoul, while Kia slumped 15%.

Reports surrounding Apple’s possible foray into the global market for automobiles re-emerged recently after going quiet since development first began in 2015. Apple has sought to keep its plans for an EV shrouded in secrecy, given the project’s potential to upend the industry — similar to how its iPhones have shaken up the consumer-electronics market. There are now millions of design-conscious shoppers globally devoted to the tech giant.

“Talks with Apple ending aren’t going to dampen Hyundai’s strategy because the automaker already has set up plans on its EV business with the Ioniq brand,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “There’s still possibility for Hyundai and Kia to cooperate with other automakers for its EV platform.”

Hyundai’s statement is almost identical to one it issued a month ago, after the company muddled its message around the highly anticipated Apple vehicle, first confirming local Korean media reports that it was in discussions with the tech behemoth, then revising its statement twice in a matter of hours. Hyundai finally said it had received requests for potential cooperation from a number of companies.

Story continues

Investors sent shares in Hyundai up almost 20% on Jan. 8 and the weeks since have been peppered with speculation over which automaker Cupertino, California-based Apple may team up with. Earlier this month another report said Kia would be the recipient of a 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) investment from Apple to make EVs, sending its stock up 10%.

A report from Japan’s Nikkei newspaper last week said Apple is in talks with at least six automakers for the development of its EV while Dow Jones said Kia had approached potential partners about a plan to assemble Apple’s electric car in Georgia.

Geely, Baidu

Like many big tech companies that are working on connected and intelligent mobility solutions, Apple likely needs to partner with an automobile manufacturer. Setting up a car plant can cost billions of dollars and take many years.

The past few months have seen a rash of tie-ups in that regard, from China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. forging collaboration pacts with Chinese search behemoth Baidu Inc. and Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology Group, to Foxconn signing a manufacturing deal with Chinese EV startup Byton Ltd.

An Apple car would rival EVs from Tesla Inc. as well as offerings from upstarts like Nio Inc., Li Auto Inc. and Lucid Motors and established players such as Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG.

EV sales are booming in Europe, reaching a record high in 2020 and this year is expected to mark yet another period of growth, supported by a string of new models. China is already the world’s largest EV market, with deliveries rising almost 10% last year to 1.11 million units, China Passenger Car Association data showed last month.

BloombergNEF forecasts that adoption of EVs will accelerate in the 2030s, and by 2050, around 65% of all passenger-vehicle kilometers traveled will be electric. By 2050, EVs will account for 73% of all new car sales globally and there will be around 800 million passenger EVs on the roads out of a total passenger-vehicle fleet of 1.5 billion.

Kia Refresh

Hyundai has recently developed a new EV-dedicated platform, and plans to build 23 models on it, beginning with the Ioniq 5 in March in Europe and followed by a Kia marque later this year. EVs made on the platform will be able to charge up to 80% capacity in 18 minutes and add as much as 100 kilometers (62 miles) of driving range in just five. They’ll have a top range of 500 kilometers on a single charge.

Kia last month rebranded with a new, sleeker logo, scrapping its oval shaped badge and announcing a fresh slogan ‘Movement that inspires’ to replace its older ‘Power to surprise’ mantra.

“Kia’s new logo represents the company’s commitment to becoming an icon for change and innovation,” Chief Executive Officer Ho Sung Song said. “The automotive industry is experiencing a period of rapid transformation, and Kia is proactively shaping and adapting.”

151,2021-02-08T01:59:26+00:00,Clubhouse App Offers Chinese Rare Glimpse of Censor-Free Debate,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. app Clubhouse erupted among Chinese social-media users over the weekend, with thousands joining discussions on contentious subjects such as Taiwan and Xinjiang undisturbed by Beijing’s censors.

On the invite-only, audio-based social app where users host informal conversations, Chinese-speaking communities from around the world gathered to discuss China-Taiwan relations and the prospects of unification, and to share their knowledge and experience of Beijing’s crackdown on Muslim Uighurs in the far west region of Xinjiang.

Open discussion of such topics is off limits in China, where heavy government censorship is the norm. Unfavorable comments or articles are rapidly removed on platforms such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Sina Corp.’s microblogging platform Weibo.

As of Sunday, Clubhouse was accessible in mainland China without needing a VPN, which is commonly used to bypass the so-called Great Firewall and access foreign internet services from Gmail to Twitter. Clubhouse, backed by California-based venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has skyrocketed in popularity following its debut in March 2020 after attracting high-profile users such as Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey.

Since Clubhouse so far is only accessible on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and users must have a non-Chinese Apple account, the app has only gained traction among a small cohort of educated citizens, according to Fang Kecheng, a communications professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

“I don’t think it can really reach the general public in China,” he said. “If so, it will surely get blocked.”

Clubhouse did not respond immediately outside of business hours to an emailed request for comment on Chinese user requirements, content related to the country and if the government had reached out to it.

Media reports have suggested the Chinese company Agora Inc. helps support Clubhouse’s underlying platform, though the little-known developer of chat-service technology has so far refrained from commenting directly on a possible connection. Shares of the U.S.-listed Agora have more than doubled since mid-January to a lifetime high, helping boost its market value to more than $10 billion.

‘I Can Tell My Story’

On Friday night, a room attracted more than 4,000 people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to share their stories and views on a range of topics including uniting the two sides.

In another room on Saturday, several members of the Uighur ethnic community now living overseas shared their experience of events in Xinjiang, where China has rolled out a widely criticized re-education program that saw an estimated 1 million people or more put into camps. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed with the Trump administration’s move to call China’s actions “genocide.” China has defended the policies, saying they are necessary to fight terrorism.

Some Clubhouse participants in the Xinjiang chat said they had lost contact with their family members and hadn’t returned home for at least four years.

“Thanks to Clubhouse I have the freedom and the audience to express my opinion,” a Finland-based doctor and activist who goes by Halmurat Harri Uyghur told Bloomberg News. “The app is beneficial to me, providing a platform for dialog between Uighurs and Chinese where I can tell my story.”

While most discussions were polite -- in line with Clubhouse’s aim to provide an alternative to the toxicity of other social media platforms – some couldn’t hide their distrust and dismissed the views shared by some of the Xinjiang participants.

There were also “silent rooms” including one to mourn the one-year anniversary of the death of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who was reprimanded by police when he tried to warn peers that a new pathogen was circulating, and who later died from Covid-19.

Another room popular with Chinese speakers discussed sexuality, while others kept the discussion to relatively “safe” topics such as books and music. The voice of “official China” wasn’t completely absent from Clubhouse: One room was dedicated to rebroadcasting Xinwen Lianbo, the country’s prime-time news program aired by the state-backed channel CCTV.

Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, said most Chinese Clubhouse users he’d spoken to are part of tech, investment and marketing circles -- people keen to hear from overseas peers and industry titans such as Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.

“Those who do engage in political discussion on Clubhouse take on a degree of personal risk,” he said. “While most are aware Clubhouse records real names, phone numbers and voice, they are broadly unaware about recent cases in China involving interrogation and jail for errant posts on Twitter.”

152,2021-02-08T01:31:36+00:00,Chip Shortage Spirals Beyond Cars to Phones and Consoles,"(Bloomberg) -- The first hints of trouble emerged in the spring of 2020. The world was in the early throes of a mysterious pandemic, which first obliterated demand then super-charged internet and mobile computing when economies regained their footing. That about-face -- in a span of months -- laid the seeds for potentially the most serious shortage in years of the semiconductors that lie at the heart of everything from smartphones to cars and TVs.

Auto and electronics makers that cut back drastically in the early days of the outbreak are now rushing to re-up orders, only to get turned away because chipmakers are stretched to the max supplying smartphone giants like Apple Inc. This week, Qualcomm Inc.’s Cristiano Amon, head of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker, flagged shortages “across the board,” citing the industry’s reliance on just a handful of players in Asia.

Amon joined a growing chorus of industry leaders warning in recent weeks they can’t get enough chips to make their products. Carmakers appear in direst straits and have spurred the U.S. and German governments to come to their aid -- General Motors Co. this month was forced to mothball three North American plants and Ford Motor Co. is bracing for a 20% drop in near-term output. But more industries have lately copped to shortages, emphasizing how Covid-19 and a boom in a new breed of 5G-ready smartphones like the iPhone 12 is exacerbating a shortage of capacity plaguing the entire consumer industry. Chip shortages are expected to wipe out $61 billion of sales for automakers alone, but the hit to the much larger electronics industry -- while tough to quantify at this early stage -- could be far larger.

Apple, a major Qualcomm customer, said recently that sales of some new high-end iPhones were hemmed in by a shortage of components. Europe’s NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG -- whose roles near the top of the supply chain grant them visibility over global chip flows -- have both indicated the constraints are no longer confined to autos. And Sony Corp. said Wednesday it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks.

“The virus pandemic, social distancing in factories, and soaring competition from tablets, laptops and electric cars are causing some of the toughest conditions for smartphone component supply in many years,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst with Strategy Analytics. He estimates prices for key smartphone components including chipsets and displays have risen as much as 15% in the past three to six months.

PC makers were among the first to hint, in the spring of 2020, at an impending crunch, a warning echoed by Lenovo Group Ltd. on Wednesday. At the heart of the crisis sits Taiwan and its largest company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the chipmaker of choice to the world’s technology and auto giants. It spent billions in past years ensuring it remains at the forefront of semiconductor production technology -- a costly exercise that’s both paid off and also thrust it into the middle of a global geopolitical dogfight.

On Friday, Qualcomm and Corning Inc. joined Biden administration officials to discuss the gathering storm with their Taiwanese counterparts and the island’s top industry representatives including TSMC. Both sides repeatedly stressed their interdependence, Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-Hua told reporters. The presence of several senior U.S. officials and the Semiconductor Industry Association -- which represents America’s biggest chipmakers -- emphasized the urgency of the situation.

The current crisis stems from several factors that converged last year. Like most every chip designer on the planet, Qualcomm outsources production to Asian companies, foremost among which are TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. The pair are increasingly the only recourse for producing the most advanced semiconductors. But their capacity takes years to plan and billions of dollars to build in tandem with customers, and the post-Covid 5G phone and internet boom took their clients by surprise.

Industry executives also blame excessive stockpiling, which began over the summer when Huawei Technologies Co. -- a major smartphone and networking gear maker -- began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei, Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020 -- making up almost a fifth of the country’s overall imports for the year.

Rivals including Apple, worried about their own caches, responded in kind. At the same time, the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers, all of which now come with smart, customized chips. TSMC executives said on its two most recent earnings calls that customers have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against uncertainties, a maneuver they see persisting for some time.

“There’s a chip stockpiling arms race,” said Will Bright, co-founder and chief product officer at Drop, which uses custom chips in headphones and keyboards.

All that has dried up the spigot for smaller-volume buyers such as the makers of cars and gaming consoles: Nintendo Co., Sony and Microsoft Corp. have struggled to make enough Switches, PlayStations and Xboxes for about a year. The game hardware industry is bracing for supply to get worse before it gets better in 2021, potentially even affecting the next holiday season, people familiar with the matter say.

It didn’t help that automakers -- the most visible cohort to be affected -- misjudged the situation. Some industry observers blame their predicament on near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in auto demand. Others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.

On Friday, Minebea Mitsumi Inc. -- a vital supplier to the transport and electronics industries -- suggested shortages may plague even more sectors, including aviation. “Demand is springing up everywhere at a faster-than-expected pace,” CEO Yoshihisa Kainuma told analysts on a call. “Airlines around the world are scrapping old aircraft to slim down their balance sheet. And people’s desire to travel will explode after the pandemic.”

It’s anybody’s guess when production will catch up with demand. But a growing number of industry observers don’t see quick or simple resolution.

“A lot of it can be traced back to the second quarter of last year, when the whole world basically shut down. Many auto companies shut down manufacturing and their suppliers re-prioritized,” said Mario Morales, an analyst with IDC. “Not until the second half will we see relief for some of these markets.”

153,2021-02-08T00:04:58+00:00,"Hyundai, Kia Shares Fall, Did-They-Didn’t-They Game Over Apple Talks Continues","By Gina Lee

Investing.com – South Korean's Hyundai Motor (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (KS:000270) saw their shares plunge, after saying that they are not in talks with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the latest round of a did-they-or-didn't-they game between the three companies.

Shares in Hyundai fell 5.01% to KRW237,000 ($211.91) by 11:59 PM ET (4:59 AM GMT) and Kia shares slumped 13.40% to KRW87,900 after both companies said earlier in the day in separate regulatory filings that “we are not having talks with Apple on developing autonomous vehicles.”

Both Korean companies saw their shares surge in early January, after Hyundai released a statement that said, “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided."" A local media report first broke the news of the collaboration, with the report also saying that the companies were ere in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or Kia.

However, Hyundai released a statement later in the day that backtracked on the earlier one, which erased all mentions of Apple but added that the company was “getting requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies.” These “various companies” were not identified.

Apple has so far declined to acknowledge that it is in talks with the Korean companies to build the vehicles. However, Apple was in December 2020 moving forward with autonomous car technology, aiming to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024, according to Reuters.

154,2021-02-07T17:41:54+00:00,Apple Supplier Dialog Semi Holds Talks With Suitors Including Renesas,"(Bloomberg) --

Dialog Semiconductor Plc, the U.K. chip designer whose clients include Apple Inc., said it’s in advanced discussions to sell the company to Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp. for about 4.9 billion euros ($5.9 billion).

The all-cash offer price of 67.50 euros per share is 20% above Dialog’s Friday close of 56.12 euros. Shares of the Frankfurt-listed company have risen around 25% since the start of the year, boosted by strong demand for Apple’s 5G handsets as well as takeover speculation.

“A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate,” Dialog said in a statement after Bloomberg reported on the talks. “There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made for the company, nor as to the terms on which any firm offer might be made.”

Dialog had been in advanced talks with suitors including Renesas and working with advisers, people familiar with the matter said earlier on Sunday. The company was previously holding discussions with STMicroelectronics NV before the Franco-Italian company was outbid, the people said.

The volume of deals involving semiconductor companies more than doubled last year to $144 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia Corp. agreed in September to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, taking control of some of the most widely used chip technology in the industry’s largest-ever deal.

Any deal could draw scrutiny from U.K. regulators as countries grow more protective of strategic industries such as semiconductors. Nvidia’s deal for Arm is set to be investigated by the country’s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority has said it will apply greater scrutiny to strategic tech deals, regardless of size.

The U.K. government is also planning to introduce new rules that would allow officials to look at past takeovers and mergers where concerns have been raised.

Renesas, which has a market value of $20.5 billion in Tokyo, is one of the largest suppliers of semiconductors used in cars. It also has European offices in the U.K. and Germany. In 2019, Renesas completed its acquisition of U.S. firm Integrated Device Technology Inc., a deal valued at more than $6 billion that helped it expand beyond the automotive sector.

Story continues

Dialog and Renesas have been working together for over a decade. The U.K. company, which specializes in designing power management chips, said in August that it would collaborate with Renesas on car computing platforms.

Both companies have found themselves part of tensions concerning the semiconductor supply chain. Apple was grappling with a shortage of vital chips that manage power consumption in iPhones and other devices, people with knowledge of the matter said in November. Within the auto industry, a semiconductor shortage is forcing car makers to halt production lines and is straining their relationship with chip suppliers.

Like Dialog, Renesas is also a supplier to Apple. The U.S. tech giant was reported to be in talks to buy Renesas SP Drivers, 55% owned by Renesas, in 2014. The unit, which managed LCD displays, was later sold to Synaptics Inc. for $475 million.

156,2021-02-07T12:41:47+00:00,20 Fastest Growing Tech Cities in the World,"In this article we are going to list the 20 fastest growing tech cities in the world. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 fastest growing tech cities in the world. According to the World Health Organization, two-thirds of the world’s population will be residing in urban cities in about 35 years. This would lead to an additional increase in the population residing in the urban cities. The demand of such an increase can only be met with the aid of cutting-edge technology. Technology will not only help with food production but also provide employment opportunities to people and a source of income. These tech cities further bring venture capital investment into the country and as a result, lead to economic prosperity and increase in standards of living.

Tech cities provide a huge benefit to their local and national economies. They help in attracting investment and skilled human resource from all over the world. Although tech cities do bring a bundle of advantages, they may also create challenges for the economies. In case of an increase in demand, the working spaces may become expensive for startups operating at a smaller scale with limited access to funds. Also, a threat of insularity may develop over time which may lead to lesser chances of external collaboration.

Government policies play a major role in the creation of tech cities. It is impossible that a city prospers in the global tech race without the intervention of its government. David Cameroon, ex-prime Minister of the UK, wanted London to be the next Silicon Valley. For this purpose, “Tech Nation” was launched by the government since their ultimate strategy was to boost technological capabilities within the UK. Similar was the ambition of the Dutch government in the Netherlands where the government focused on making favorable trade deals that would increase the technological potential of the cities like Eindhoven, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. For example, Startup Amsterdam was initiated by the Dutch Government to increase the collaboration between the city and the private companies. Through this initiative startup could seek help and expand within the same environment, thus helping the Netherlands economy grow and become one of the tech countries that promotes innovation and collaboration.

Huge tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are based in USA because of tech-friendly initiatives and policies by the government. On the other hand, the French government, under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged to make Paris the capital among all the tech nations, giving stiff competition to other European countries like Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. Paris has been home to the multi-million-pound startup, Station F, which serves as the biggest startup campus. There has been a large influx of startups moving to Paris and working at Station F. Not just small-scaled startups are using Station F’s resources and services, but also partners like Vente-Privée, HEC (NASDAQ:HEC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), L'Oréal and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN).

Berlin, arguably the world’s coolest city, is not far behind in technology and innovation. The organizational culture thrives on focusing on innovation. It is also home to one of the most successful startups, Delivery Hero, operating in more than 40+ companies and a parent company to Foodpanda, which rivals Uber Eats in certain countries. The German government introduced the Digital Hub Initiative to encourage collaboration between various startups in the digital era. The rankings and listings of the fastest-growing tech cities in the world have been compiled from London and Partners, Forbes, and Savills. So without further ado, let's take a look at the cities which are going to be the future tech capitals of the world, starting with number 20:

20. Eindhoven

Eindhoven is the hub of technology and innovation in Netherlands. This city is home to companies such as ASML, Phillips and VDL.

Moreover, the Lithuanian government has introduced what is known as a “start-up visa” to encourage tech businesses and top talent from all over the world to settle in Vilnius.

18. Tallinn

What is fascinating about the tech capital of Estonia, Tallinn, is that with an e-Residency permit, an individual can start their business in Estonia, without actually living there. This is because around 99% of the public services are available online, which makes it incredibly easy for tech companies to establish there, something the other countries are still struggling with. In addition, the government has also introduced a digital nomad visa, which will allow individuals working remotely to live and work in Estonia for up to one year. This provides a supportive environment for tech businesses or startups.

17. Cape Town

Cape Town is not only home to a scenic landscape but also to the largest financial institutions of the country. Startups are now taking advantage of the wide availability of the financial services in the city to expand their operations and services. As per the data by Invest Cape Town, around 60% of the South African startups are situated in Cape Town. However, venture capital investment is on the rise as well, in particular, it grew by 147% from 2016-2019. Thus, making Cape Town a popular choice among the tech companies.

8. New York City

Before 2010, New York was quite far behind Silicon Valley and Boston in technology and innovation. Now it is catching up and it is catching up fast. It is not because of its infrastructure, but because of its progress as a metropolitan city offering access to diverse and skilled labor. During 2013, there were around 7000 high tech companies operating in the city, as per the state’s office. The city also provided a free Wi-Fi facility, known as LinkNYC, which was made available to the public including small scale businesses. Worst Neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn in 2018

157,2021-02-07T12:41:47+00:00,20 Fastest Growing Tech Cities in the World,"In this article we are going to list the 20 fastest growing tech cities in the world. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 fastest growing tech cities in the world. According to the World Health Organization, two-thirds of the world’s population will be residing in urban cities in about 35 years. This would lead to an additional increase in the population residing in the urban cities. The demand of such an increase can only be met with the aid of cutting-edge technology. Technology will not only help with food production but also provide employment opportunities to people and a source of income. These tech cities further bring venture capital investment into the country and as a result, lead to economic prosperity and increase in standards of living.

Tech cities provide a huge benefit to their local and national economies. They help in attracting investment and skilled human resource from all over the world. Although tech cities do bring a bundle of advantages, they may also create challenges for the economies. In case of an increase in demand, the working spaces may become expensive for startups operating at a smaller scale with limited access to funds. Also, a threat of insularity may develop over time which may lead to lesser chances of external collaboration.

Government policies play a major role in the creation of tech cities. It is impossible that a city prospers in the global tech race without the intervention of its government. David Cameroon, ex-prime Minister of the UK, wanted London to be the next Silicon Valley. For this purpose, “Tech Nation” was launched by the government since their ultimate strategy was to boost technological capabilities within the UK. Similar was the ambition of the Dutch government in the Netherlands where the government focused on making favorable trade deals that would increase the technological potential of the cities like Eindhoven, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. For example, Startup Amsterdam was initiated by the Dutch Government to increase the collaboration between the city and the private companies. Through this initiative startup could seek help and expand within the same environment, thus helping the Netherlands economy grow and become one of the tech countries that promotes innovation and collaboration.

Huge tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are based in USA because of tech-friendly initiatives and policies by the government. On the other hand, the French government, under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged to make Paris the capital among all the tech nations, giving stiff competition to other European countries like Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. Paris has been home to the multi-million-pound startup, Station F, which serves as the biggest startup campus. There has been a large influx of startups moving to Paris and working at Station F. Not just small-scaled startups are using Station F’s resources and services, but also partners like Vente-Privée, HEC (NASDAQ:HEC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), L'Oréal and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN).

Berlin, arguably the world’s coolest city, is not far behind in technology and innovation. The organizational culture thrives on focusing on innovation. It is also home to one of the most successful startups, Delivery Hero, operating in more than 40+ companies and a parent company to Foodpanda, which rivals Uber Eats in certain countries. The German government introduced the Digital Hub Initiative to encourage collaboration between various startups in the digital era. The rankings and listings of the fastest-growing tech cities in the world have been compiled from London and Partners, Forbes, and Savills. So without further ado, let's take a look at the cities which are going to be the future tech capitals of the world, starting with number 20:

20. Eindhoven

Eindhoven is the hub of technology and innovation in Netherlands. This city is home to companies such as ASML, Phillips and VDL. Eindhoven enjoys lower costs of living which attracts businesses to set up their offices and operations within this city. Moreover, a good standard of living also attracts talent from all over the world. There are currently 220 companies operating within a single High-tech campus in Eindhoven.

19. Vilnius

Vilnius, a city in Lithuania, is known for its leadership in cybersecurity, fintech and software engineering. Although the city is not widely thought of as a travel destination, it is popular among fintech companies or startups that wish to expand. Currently, Lithuania has more than 1000 startups and 200 fintech companies. Moreover, the Lithuanian government has introduced what is known as a “start-up visa” to encourage tech businesses and top talent from all over the world to settle in Vilnius.

18. Tallinn

What is fascinating about the tech capital of Estonia, Tallinn, is that with an e-Residency permit, an individual can start their business in Estonia, without actually living there. This is because around 99% of the public services are available online, which makes it incredibly easy for tech companies to establish there, something the other countries are still struggling with. In addition, the government has also introduced a digital nomad visa, which will allow individuals working remotely to live and work in Estonia for up to one year. This provides a supportive environment for tech businesses or startups.

17. Cape Town

Cape Town is not only home to a scenic landscape but also to the largest financial institutions of the country. Startups are now taking advantage of the wide availability of the financial services in the city to expand their operations and services. As per the data by Invest Cape Town, around 60% of the South African startups are situated in Cape Town. However, venture capital investment is on the rise as well, in particular, it grew by 147% from 2016-2019. Thus, making Cape Town a popular choice among the tech companies.

16. Bogota

With a jump of 200 places from 2016-2020, Bogota is now one of the fastest-growing tech cities of the world. Businesses enjoy cheaper costs, better tax incentives and rising availability of talent. The local government provides training schemes to the tech businesses, as well as promotes business wellbeing by introducing the iNNPulsa and Apps. co initiatives. A report by Ernst and Young in 2019, states that 76% of the entire population uses fintech services in Columbia which makes it the highest fintech adoption rate in any Latin nation.

15. Yokohama

Being the hub of shipping and trade for 150 years, Yokohama has attracted international investors and businesses as a result of its highly educated and skilled labor force. In addition, its close proximity to Tokyo has also been a factor in the city becoming one of the fastest growing tech cities in the world. Companies like Lenovo, Samsung and Apple have set up research and development centers in the city, owing to its wide specialty in the field of R&D. Hence more and more tech companies prefer to establish their businesses in the city.

14. Detroit

Detroit was known for its auto industry before the Great Depression. It is now building itself to be a tech city of the world. Its major focus is now shifting to mobility technology, for which it has entered into partnerships with giants like Google, Fiat and Ford. Furthermore, Detroit offers a low cost of living which attracts skilled talent from all over the country.

13. Manchester

Manchester is on the track to become the world’s fastest-growing tech cities. It currently has a tech industry comprising of more than 10,000 digital and tech companies, which includes Google, Microsoft, and IBM. The Manchester University, because of its strong link with the industry, produces highly skilled workforce which works on projects in the tech companies, allowing them to grow.

12. Beijing

Beijing has jumped up 15 spots from 2016 to 2020, for being the world’s fastest-growing tech economy. Although the city may not offer the same incentives or a supportive culture towards startups, relative to other high-tech cities, it is widely recognized as a smartphone hub which attracts smartphone companies and ventures.

11. Shenzhen

The city is known for its patent filings and IP litigations. However, it has recently emerged as a technology leader within the region, after a focus towards manufacturing. As a result, telecom industry giants have made their way into this city.

10. Shanghai

Just like other Chinese cities Shanghai also specializes in patent making. This patent filing for some companies is important in order to protect their intellectual property. Therefore, increasing manufacturing companies have set up their operations in this city to utilize this service while they focus on R&D and manufacturing. Currently, Shanghai’s ‘Silicon Valley’ has more than 1000,000 workers employed within the companies.

9. Toronto

The city of Toronto attracts many small and medium-sized enterprises. This is a result of its business-friendly policies and a pro-immigration government. Toronto has a very strong diverse culture which supports collaboration among businesses and encourages startups to seek expertise and expand. Furthermore, the Economic Growth Division offers innovative infrastructure facilities like co-working spaces, incubators, hubs, and accelerator programs to boost startups.

8. New York City

Before 2010, New York was quite far behind Silicon Valley and Boston in technology and innovation. Now it is catching up and it is catching up fast. It is not because of its infrastructure, but because of its progress as a metropolitan city offering access to diverse and skilled labor. During 2013, there were around 7000 high tech companies operating in the city, as per the state’s office. The city also provided a free Wi-Fi facility, known as LinkNYC, which was made available to the public including small scale businesses. Worst Neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn in 2018

158,2021-02-05T21:35:33+00:00,"Apple Talks With Hyundai, Kia on Electric Car Paused Recently","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has held talks with Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. about building an electric vehicle, though the discussions paused recently, according to people familiar with the situation.

Apple has also been discussing similar plans with other auto manufacturers, the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

The secret project has ramped up in recent months. It has the potential to upend the automotive industry and its supply chain in a similar way to Apple’s reinvention of the consumer device market.

Apple declined to comment. In January, Hyundai, which owns a controlling stake in Kia, backed away from a statement that said it was in talks with Apple.

That announcement, and other reports of talks, have upset Apple, which keeps development projects secret for years and controls relationships with suppliers with ruthless efficiency.

It’s unclear if -- or when -- discussions between Apple and Hyundai might resume. There are only a handful of global automakers with the capacity and capability to mass manufacture vehicles, and it’s unclear how many of them would be interested in collaborating with Apple.

There are other hitches, too. One is a dispute within the Hyundai group over which of its two brands, Hyundai or Kia, may get to manufacture a car for Apple, one of the people familiar with the situation said. If talks end up resuming, Kia is seen as more likely and is seeking to build an Apple car at its plant in Georgia, said the person.

A key question for the industry is how serious Apple is about taking on Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and other electric vehicle makers, and whether it needs an established manufacturer to be able to roll out its own product.

The Cupertino, California-based company has a small team of engineers developing drive systems, as well as designers, but with development work is at an early stage, any roll out probably won’t happen for another five years. That suggests Apple has more time to decide on potential auto-industry partners.

159,2021-02-05T21:25:39+00:00,RPT: Apple in talks to build autonomous EV with Kia,"According to recent reports, Apple has entered talks with Kia to build an autonomous electric vehicle. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joined Yahoo Finance Live to break down the details.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: I want to talk about another big story this week, and that, of course, is Apple's car plans. Now we talked about reports that Apple is on the verge of reaching a deal with Hyundai. Well, Dan Howley is digging a little bit deeper into this story for us. And Dan, when we talk about Apple's car, you actually think it could be Tesla's biggest rival. Why?

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think the big idea here has to do with the fact that, A, Apple already has firm knowledge of supply chain throughout the world set up-- excuse me-- by current CEO Tim Cook. And so that would give them a lot of strength.

And beyond that, they have great customer service, or great understanding of customer service, in the fact that they changed, really, the paradigm for how people go into stores and purchase smartphones or cell phones. It used to be a huge hassle to deal with carriers, to go into your local electronics store. Apple basically came and said, OK, we'll be able to sell everything through our own storefront, make it very easy, very customer centric.

And so, some of the experts that I spoke to essentially said, look, if they can do that with the automotive industry, take away the problem of having to go to a dealership and deal with, you know, hassles of salespeople, then that would be incredible.

And on top of that, they've been working on this technology for some time now. This isn't something that they haven't, you know-- or just jumping into headfirst. They've been working on self-driving technology. They've had vehicles on the road for some time now. And they do have an understanding of the battery. So they wouldn't have to deal with a ramp-up similar to the way Tesla did in building up its own factory. Because according to the reports, they're going to work with Hyundai, Kia. So I think if there's a company that's going to rival Tesla in the EV space, it may just be Apple.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/rpt-apple-talks-build-autonomous-212539264.html?.tsrc=rss,"['000270.KO', 'AAPL.US']","['APPLE', 'DAN HOWLEY']","{'polarity': 0.935, 'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.077}"

Powerful enough to gut check some of Wall Street’s most influential hedge funds. Because of the euphoria, there’s a temptation to join in. However, newcomers should really focus on stocks for beginners.

Now, don’t get me wrong — I’m not here to tell you what to do with your money. Certainly, an argument exists for speculation. While the best investing roadmap involves tried-and-true strategies, sometimes, you want to try to bake in some luck. Throw a few dollars into potentially viable startups and eventually, you may hit pay dirt. But that’s not a core strategy for stocks for beginners.

Instead, if one of the Reddit plays has got you thinking about investing in general, at least the craziness was good for something! While I’m not sure how long the boom will last, eventually, these euphoric rallies crumble. Regarding stocks for beginners, your main purpose is to find compelling opportunities that will either provide stable growth or are undervalued relative to their company or industry fundamentals.

As well, we’re entering a new era under the administration of President Joe Biden. Of course, I’m not naïve to assume that every American is happy about it. But the important point here is that Biden, with Democrats controlling Congress, will push policies that overtly benefit certain sectors, such as clean energy and electric vehicles. And there are plenty of stocks for beginners in these arenas.

Also, there might be some upside regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic. As I write this, Covid-19 infections are sharply declining, which is a huge positive. However, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that such a shock health and economic crisis will impose a lingering effect. Ultimately, you have many areas to explore regarding stocks for beginners:

Story continues

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) American Well (NYSE:AMWL) Livent (NYSE:LTHM) Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Ford (NYSE:F) AT&T (NYSE:T) Ocean Power Technologies (NASDAQ:OPTT)

Before we dive in, I kept with one exception the unit price under $100. Although fractional share ownership is becoming popular among online brokerages, it’s not a standard feature. Since we’re talking about stocks for beginners, I deliberately crafted a list of accessible names.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Apple (AAPL) An Apple (AAPL) MacBook Air laptop sitting under bright purple lights.

We’re going to start with the exception among this list of stocks for beginners and that is consumer electronics giant Apple. Previously, I wondered about how sustainable AAPL stock would be with Steve Jobs tragically out of the picture. It was really his vision and his outside-the-box thinking that catapulted Apple to where it is today.

Further, I worried about the increasing competition. With the smartphone market being saturated, it didn’t seem that there was enough distinction for the company moving forward. But I was wrong.

Frankly, I’m still not sure if Apple products are really all that much better to justify their price tag relative to rival offerings. Nevertheless, you have the power of Apple’s brand, which truly resonates with the consumer. In addition, the Apple ecosystem is intuitive and convenient, both from a personal and professional standpoint.

And that has kept consumers buying more — even during this once-in-a-century pandemic. That bodes well for AAPL stock as a core holding for newcomers’ portfolios.

When the coronavirus pandemic first roiled our nation, the last thing that Americans had on their mind was visiting the doctor’s office. With a mysterious virus rippling throughout the globe, seeking medical treatment was a hazardous activity and not worth the risk — unless of course the situation was life-threatening.

However, you can’t ignore medical advice indefinitely, which is what caused Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) to skyrocket throughout 2020. A leading investment in the telehealth industry, TDOC is extremely relevant today. However, it’s not what I would call the most accessible among stocks for beginners. That’s why you may wish to consider American Well.

At a time of writing price under $40, AMWL stock better fits the newcomer’s portfolio. You can buy shares of this and other viable names, giving you greater diversity. But what I really like about American Well is its contrarian pertinence.

True, declining Covid-19 cases don’t necessarily do AMWL stock any favors. However, as research published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research indicates, the 1918 influenza outbreak “had long-lasting social consequences leading to a decline in social trust.”

7 Hot Robinhood and Reddit Stocks That Are Likely to See Price Action Soon

This fairly sums up what we should expect in the next few years, creating an intriguing setup for AMWL.

Livent (LTHM) Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipes

Over the next several decades, the U.S. and other nations will push for net-zero-emissions policies. Logically, this means that we’ll see more electric vehicles hitting the road, while simultaneously witnessing a phasing out of the internal combustion engine. However, I believe the mistake is to assume that the EV revolution will happen overnight. Therefore, we’re seeing some EV manufacturers sporting some crazy valuations.

Yes, I get the argument that many EV companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are aspirational. Therefore, standard analyses may not apply. Setting that aside, it’s hard to ignore that EV shares look frothy. To better avoid holding the bag while still getting exposure to this market, you may want to consider Livent as one of the stocks for beginners.

With LTHM stock, you don’t have to figure out which EV brand will outshine its rivals. Instead, you’re going with an organization that feeds the core lithium commodity to these manufacturers. Look at it this way: you’re selling tickets to the game instead of gambling which team will win.

Better yet, LTHM stock is tied to many other relevant markets — such as aerospace, polymers and pharmaceuticals — giving you broad exposure and thus a measure of reliability.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) The Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of a digital American flag background.

As one of the world’s largest publicly traded renewable power platforms, Brookfield Renewable Partners was already an important component of the broader push for clean energy. However, the heightened political state of 2020 made the case for BEP stock all the more pertinent.

There’s some truth to the concept that regular folks shouldn’t get too emotional about what’s happening in Washington. For the most part, whether Democrat or Republican, the drama appears the same old manufactured dog-and-pony act.

Nevertheless, elections do have consequences, and this is perhaps no more evident than in the environmental realm. As the Washington Post reported, President Trump stripped protections from Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, an ecologically significant region. I can’t imagine that had Biden been president during that time, such a move would have occurred.

7 SaaS Stocks to Buy Today for the Smartphone Generation

Thus, BEP stock may have a viable upside pathway, at least for the next four years (although we’ll see how the Democrats fare in the upcoming midterm election). Even if a power struggle occurs, both conservatives and liberals should agree on clean energy in terms of independence from foreign markets.

From the get-go, I’m going to warn you that CVS Health is a forward-looking contrarian play baking in some assumptions about society and the economy. Therefore, it’s not the safest idea among stocks for beginners. But if you don’t mind the threat of volatility and have a patient outlook, CVS stock could work for you.

Economically, I believe analysts are being more optimistic than what the data justifies. For instance, we hear the weekly ups and downs of new jobless claims. But the overriding narrative is that since late August/early September of last year, these initial claims have stabilized around the 800,000 mark.

That’s utterly terrible when you consider that these figures are worse than the Great Recession peak — and have been occurring weekly. Not only that, check out the personal saving rate in December, which ticked up to 13.7% from 12.9% in November. Clearly, consumers were not feeling the holiday spirit in terms of gift purchases.

In my view, this suggests that we’ll see less medical visits, and an increase in self-care purchases. Cynically, this bodes well for CVS stock.

Previously, I mentioned that lithium providers offer a more reasonable risk-reward profile toward the EV market. Because it’s such a new concept that requires a broader infrastructural buildout among other challenges, going all-in on one particular EV company isn’t the most prudent choice. And I’m not about to suggest that Ford is an exception. However, regarding EV stocks for beginners, this is one to consider for a balanced portfolio.

Here’s the deal with EVs — they’re awfully expensive, especially when you take out the tax incentives which won’t be there indefinitely. For instance, the median household income in the U.S. is just under $69,000. When you take into account taxes, the net amount makes buying a Tesla Model 3 — the cheapest car in its lineup — a questionable proposition.

That’s why I think combustion cars will be around for a while. With their superior economies of scale, Ford can deliver reasonably priced cars and SUVS for the masses. This alone is a catalyst for F stock.

As well, you have the Ford Mustang Mach-E. While it peeved Mustang enthusiasts, the Mach-E is an able competitor in the EV arena. Watch F stock carefully because this might be one of the most underappreciated automotive investments.

AT&T (T) Image of AT&T (T) logo on a gray storefront

Although AT&T fundamentally benefits from the widescale 5G rollout, many investors have taken a dim view on T stock. Relevance isn’t enough to overcome some ugly fundamentals, primarily the underlying company’s massive debt load. Thanks to the cord-cutting phenomenon and some very unfortunately timed acquisitions, AT&T on paper does not look appetizing.

Even its generous dividend yield is not a cause for celebration. Indeed, many analysts warn that such a high payout indicates instability. In other words, AT&T has to do something to earn your investment dollars. A high yield just might lure some naïve people in.

I could be one of those naïve people. Time will tell. However, at these prices, T stock is certainly intriguing because it doesn’t seem to reflect the potential of its HBO Max streaming service. The reality is that HBO has a history of delivering compelling content, which should draw in consumers.

Further, most Americans are afraid to go to the movie theater for the first six months of this year. Therefore, people will have to rely on streaming services for the big Hollywood hits. More so than other streaming companies, this benefits AT&T in my opinion, making it a risky but intriguing name among stocks for beginners.

Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT) a light buoy in the middle of the ocean. stocks under $10

If you really want to get crazy with your stocks for beginners, Ocean Power Technologies is it. On a year-to-date basis, OPTT stock is up nearly 82%. I mention this because a possibility exists that shares could tumble having gone up so much in a short period of time.

Then again, we’ve seen some gravity defying investments, including some publicly traded companies with incredibly flawed fundamentals. So if those organizations can fly, I like my chances with Ocean Power Technologies.

As you might infer from its name, Ocean Power specializes in wave energy, essentially harnessing the movements of the ocean to generate clean, renewable energy. Primarily, the advantage is that OPTT stock is levered toward an always-on source, unlike solar and wind which are intermittent.

Second but just as importantly, wave energy platforms are out of sight and out of mind. While the technological improvements in wind and solar are exciting, they’re either eyesores or require much real estate.

“We have said we believe our order-to-delivery is going to come down. This investment certainly will help. We see light at the end of the tunnel for sure, with these manufacturing ramps. We've added two new factories in Taiwan over the last four months alone. And so we feel like we're in a good place with manufacturing and sourcing,” Lynch said, who is also a Peloton board member.

Lynch added, “We expect continued accelerated growth, which is exciting for us and exciting for the community as it builds. So we do see a light at the end of the tunnel, yeah. And we do expect it to get better in the spring.”

To help overcome port congestion and limited capacity, Peloton said it will spend $100 million in its current fiscal year to address the issues.

Peloton shares fell about 5% in early trading Friday despite a strong quarter, paced by a 128% improvement in sales compared to last year.

164,2021-02-05T06:32:00+00:00,Apple Car Reports Fuel Speculation of Kia or Japan Carmaker Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Speculation that Apple Inc. is seeking a partner to develop its own electric vehicle swept through South Korea and Japan, where shares of major car companies climbed on reports of discussions with the maker of the iPhone.

Kia Motors Corp. is talking to potential partners about a plan to assemble an Apple-designed car, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Separately, the Nikkei newspaper said Apple was in discussions with at least six automakers. Conjecture around Apple’s secretive project to design and sell its own car re-emerged in December after a hiatus of several years, with Kia’s part-owner Hyundai Motor Co. mentioned as a potential partner.

The key question is how serious Apple is about taking on Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle makers, and whether it has determined it will need a established manufacturer to be able to roll out its own product. The Cupertino, California-based company is said to have a small team of engineers developing drive systems, as well as designers, but with development work at an early stage, any roll out probably won’t happen for another five years.

Tatsuo Yoshida, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that Japanese automakers are usually too busy with their own development, manufacturing, sales and customer service to take on a task like working with Apple. However, Nissan Motor Co. or Mitsubishi Motors Corp. “don’t have much work, and are somewhat idle, so they might sign up,” he said.

When asked if they were approached, Honda Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. said they couldn’t comment, the Nikkei said. Mitsubishi Motors said it was not contacted and Nissan declined to comment, according to the report. Subaru Corp.’s chief financial officer said on an earnings call that he hadn’t heard anything about an Apple car.

Kia shares rose 1.5% in Seoul, adding to gains from earlier this week on a local media report that Apple would invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) as part of a collaboration with the automaker on making EVs. In December, Hyundai backed away from a statement that said it was in talks with Apple.

The Journal reported a deal between Apple and Kia will involve a multibillion-dollar investment, with assembly to take place in the state of Georgia. This week, CNBC reported that Apple is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to build an autonomous EV at Kia’s U.S. plant. No agreement has been reached, but they are tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, the news channel said.

A representative for Kia declined to comment.

Hyundai has developed a new EV-dedicated platform, and plans to build 23 EVs, beginning with the Ioniq 5 in March in Europe, followed by a Kia model later this year. EVs made on the platform will be able to charge up to 80% capacity in 18 minutes and add as much as 100 kilometers (62 miles) of driving range in just five. They’ll have a top range of 500 kilometers on a single charge. Hyundai is aiming to sell 1 million cars by 2025.

In Japan, the report fueled gains among automakers, which in turn boosted the benchmark Topix, with Toyota Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors, and Nissan rising. Mazda shares also jumped 19%, the most in 12 years, after the company boosted its operating income forecast for the full year.

Among Japan’s carmakers, Nissan probably has the right solution for a non-automaker seeking to enter the EV market. The Japanese automaker has developed with French partner Renault SA a common EV platform that can be used by to develop distinct, branded products for their global automaking alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors.

Nidec Corp., a major Japanese supplier of electric motors, is also seeking to offer nearly complete EV platforms. Jun Seki, the company’s chief operating officer, said in a recent interview that new entrants in the sector would prefer to focus on a vehicle’s interior and styling.

“Any new company entering into the realm of electric vehicles is a chance for us,” Seki said. “Our expectations of Apple are quite high. Apple is our important customer in other fields as well.”

166,2021-02-04T16:36:26+00:00,12 Most Influential Chinese Entrepreneurs,"In this article we are going to list the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs.

The People’s Republic of China has evolved into one of the richest countries of the world in just a few decades. According to data published by the World Bank in 2019, the Gross Domestic Product or GDP of China has had a sharp increase since 1990, with the number climbing almost exponentially. David Mann, global chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, commented on this rapid economic growth, stating that ""From the end of the 1970s onwards we've seen what is easily the most impressive economic miracle of any economy in history.""

This success can be accredited to a number of reasons. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, beginning the boom of Chinese goods in World trade. Research published by London School of Economics further illustrated this massive increase. By 1985, exports were $25 billion, $15 billion more than what they were 9 years ago in 1976. Just 25 years later, in 2010, exports valued at an amount of $3 trillion dollars; 300 times more than what the value was in 1985.

As trade between nations increased, so did the Chinese public’s interest in entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur is someone who participates in the act of setting up a business, while also bearing the effects of this risk in hope of a profit. A good business idea has the power to rake in millions but getting to that point where profit is being generated consistently can be a long, difficult journey. 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs

The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is one platform which studies entrepreneurial behavior and attitudes of several countries across the world. Data collected in 2019 for China showed that 9.33 percent of the public (ages 18-64) owned an established business. This included those who are owning and managing a running business that has paid salaries, wages, or any other payments to the owners for more than 42 months. The same platform also displayed data on the attitude of Chinese society towards entrepreneurs. Almost 80 percent of people agreed with the statement that in their country, most people consider starting a business as a desirable career choice.

All this evidence points towards the fact that in general, entrepreneurs are viewed in a quite favorable light by the Chinese public. Because of this, those entrepreneurs who have a considerable reach may have the distinct power of influencing those around them. Whether this is by inspiring the population with their success story, or by introducing a revolutionary idea through their product, Chinese entrepreneurs have affected the general public in one way or another.

For this reason, we have prepared a list of the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs. To prepare their ranking, we have used Fortune China and Forbes as our source, ranking each business leader based on not only their company’s success, but also their influence on the general public. Let us look at the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs, starting with number 12.

12. Zhang Jindong

Zhang is the chairman of Suning.com, one of the largest retailers in China, and is said to be among the top 3 in the Chinese e-commerce industry. Zhang has certainly come a long way from when he first started the company in 1998 as an air-conditioning store. Throughout the years, he has diverged into many markets, moving from air conditioning to home appliances to online shopping. Zhang is also the owner of a privately-held company called Suning Holdings Group, which is particularly famous for having acquired the famous Italian football club Inter Milan. In 2019, Suning.com acquired 80% of Wanda Department Store and Carrefour China, increasing the reach of his company even further. 10 Biggest Universities in the US

The business model is similar to that of the American service Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN), while Meituan itself boasts an aspiration to be the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of services. Having built Meituan to become a multi-billion dollar company, that dream doesn’t seem too far off. Meituan, formerly known as Meituan Dianping after the two companies’ merger, is not the only entrepreneurial stint of Wang. In 2005 and 2007 he created Chinese versions of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), called Xiaonei and Fanfou respectively. Although not at the level of Meituan, both websites proved to be hits for Wang, and showcased his drive for being a business leader.

After graduating from university, he worked for several companies, climbing to the rank of director. At age 39, he decided to start his own company, named Evergrande, which currently ranks within the first 200 on the Fortune Global 500 and is a top competitor in the Real Estate Market.

Chicago, IL – February 4, 2021 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Computers, including Apple Inc. AAPL, HP Inc. HPQ and Lenovo Group Limited LNVGY.

Coronavirus outbreak has been beneficial for the Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry as it raised demand for PCs and tablets significantly. Despite massive supply-chain disruption the ongoing work-from-home and online learning wave have been beneficial for industry participants like Apple, HP and Lenovo Group.

Although extensive job losses are expected to hurt demand for high-end laptops and smartphones in the near term, the availability of 5G-based iPhones has been a key catalyst. Further, the launch of foldable as well as AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables are major growth drivers for the industry participants.

Industry Description

The Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry comprises prominent companies like Apple and HP that offer devices including smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers.

Such devices are based either on Apple’s iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS or on Microsoft Windows or on Google Chrome and Android operating systems. They predominantly use processors from Apple, AMD, Samsung and MediaTek, among others.

3 Mini Computer Industry Trends to Watch Out For

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Aids Momentum: The industry is benefiting from the rapid adoption of BYOD in workplaces. Enterprises practicing BYOD allow employees to use their personal devices, including mobiles, laptops and tablets, for work purposes. BYOD helps in bridging communication gaps between remote workers and desk-bound employees, thereby improving process management and workflow. Moreover, BYOD has been proved more productive as it lowers training time. Moreover, the coronavirus-induced remote working and online learning model bodes well for industry participants as demand is expected to increase for desktops and laptops. IDC expects PC shipments to increase 1.4% in 2021 driven by work from home and remote education.

Impressive Formfactor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm (Snapdragon-branded), NVIDIA (Tegra X1), Apple (A14 Bionic) and Samsung (Exynos 9609). Moreover, improved Internet penetration and speed along with the evolution of mobile apps have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Further, the improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing games like PUBG and Fortnite. This is expected to boost demand for high-end smartphones and open up significant opportunities for device makers.

PCs Face Extinction Risk: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based, have been facing the risk of extinction due to the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. Stiff competition from smartphones has compelled global PC makers to not only upgrade hardware frequently but also add apps and cloud-based services to attract consumers. Nevertheless, the emergence of 5G, AI, machine learning and foldable computers is likely to be the key catalyst in expanding the total addressable market (TAM) of the PCs.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects

The Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #2, which places it in the top 1% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

Subscription-based video streaming, news and gaming services are expected to benefit from Apple’s strong installed base. Moreover, its wearables and hearables businesses are expected to be driven by solid demand for Apple Watch and Airpods. Additionally, strong demand for 5G-enabled iPhone is a major growth driver.

Further, the Cupertino, CA-based company currently has more than 620 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company offer appealing new apps that drive App Store traffic.

Further, a growing number of AI-infused apps will attract more subscribers on App Store. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company recently unveiled Apple One bundled plan, which is expected to drive Services revenues further. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has moved up 10.9% to $4.47 per share over the past 30 days. Shares are up 69.4% in the past year.

Lenovo Group: This Hong Kong-based company is dominating the PC market. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is well-poised to gain from the ongoing remote working and online learning wave due to its ever-expanding portfolio. Per Gartner’s latest report, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Lenovo retained the top spot with a 27.1% market share, followed by HP’s 19.8%. The next three positions are held by Dell, Apple and Acer Group, with a market share of 16.6%, 8.7%, and 6%, respectively.

Lenovo’s position has also improved in the server market. Per IDC’s third-quarter report, Lenovo was placed in the fourth spot with market share improving 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Markedly, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard tied at the #1 position.

HP – This Zacks Rank #2 company is benefiting from solid PC demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic-led remote working and online learning wave. Solid revenue growth in retail solutions business and gaming as well as services orders is a positive. HP has been launching several innovative models in the PC segment as well as in the Printing segment. We believe that the continuous product launches will help this Palo Alto, CA-based company stay afloat in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.

Furthermore, stringent cost-control measures are expected to drive margins over the long run. Moreover, HP expects to return at least $1 billion to shareholders every quarter in the near term, which is encouraging.

The consensus mark for fiscal 2021 earnings stayed at $2.67 per share over the past 30 days. The stock is up 15.5% in the past year.

These Stocks Are Poised to Soar Past the Pandemic

The COVID-19 outbreak has shifted consumer behavior dramatically, and a handful of high-tech companies have stepped up to keep America running. Right now, investors in these companies have a shot at serious profits. For example, Zoom jumped 108.5% in less than 4 months while most other stocks were sinking.

Our research shows that 5 cutting-edge stocks could skyrocket from the exponential increase in demand for “stay at home” technologies. This could be one of the biggest buying opportunities of this decade, especially for those who get in early.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Falling COVID case numbers and ramped-up vaccines offer real hope in the fight against the pandemic. But the job crisis continues to get worse as almost a million people file for unemployment benefits each week. CareerBuilder CEO Irina Novoselsky, who has led the online recruitment company for over three years, knows the job market better than just about anybody.

To get where she is today, she worked 50-hour weeks at Morgan Stanley to put herself through New York University's Stern School of Business and rose quickly up the ranks at the cloud company Novitex. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" Irina joined me to talk about what the recovery will look like, whether more stimulus will make a difference, and how job-seekers can make their application stand out.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Irina Novoselsky. And she is the CEO of CareerBuilder. Irina, nice to see you.

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Good to see you again, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot to talk about on the job front. I guess the big question is the unemployment picture is still pretty bad. How dire is the job market?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: You know, we like to look at it in terms of progress. And we're making some progress. We made a lot of progress in the summer. And really with this holiday wave of COVID, we've seen a big setback. And one of the things that all of our clients are looking to is really to get some certainty around the timeline of the vaccinations and COVID, because one of the things that businesses are looking for in planning their 2021 budget is signs and timelines of stability.

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you a couple of questions about that-- the vaccine-- the rollout being slower than anticipated, is that impacting hiring, do you think?

Story continues

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I think it's a combination of as more and more people are getting COVID or being affected by those in their pods that are getting COVID, we're seeing productivity get impacted. So whether it's more of our employee base is starting to get COVID, or their child care, or their education providers-- and so that's slowly coming through companies at a much higher rate than it was earlier.

And then the combination of really not having a clear timeline yet on the vaccines is helping companies or forcing companies to really think through their hiring timelines. And so it's a few of these starts and stops that we're seeing where hire fast, OK, hold on, let's watch. Hire fast, let's wait and see.

ANDY SERWER: And then also going back to the office, right, I mean, that's being impacted here. How is that affecting hiring plans?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Well, it's definitely impacting candidate plans. One of the things that we surveyed is that 40% of candidates would not work for a company that is not offering a work-from-home option. The searches that we've seen candidates conduct on work-from-home has gone up by 80%. And also the reverse side, employers are putting more flexibility out there.

But one of the conversations that we're not seeing as much is there's really huge parts of the population in really big industries that aren't able to offer a work-from-home option. And so what are those candidates going to be looking at as they consider do they want to go into one of those industries or not?

ANDY SERWER: But does that confer an advantage to those businesses that are having people in offices?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Definitely-- well, an advantage to those that are offering work-from-home. And it's also offering, actually, an advantage to suburban cities. A lot of times middle market companies, small businesses that weren't in major cities were competing with talent with a major zip code. And now, given the flexibility of work-from-home, how we've shown that productivity can sustain itself, all of a sudden, you're seeing middle-sized businesses step up and compete for talent with some of the big guys.

ANDY SERWER: What about seniors in college right now, Irina? That's got to be tough. What are they facing?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: It is really hard, especially one of the things that we spend a lot of time on. And it's really affecting the whole part of the population, but specifically seniors, is they're entering the workforce in this unprecedented. Time many of them will never meet their employers face-to-face. Virtual hiring events, we are doing those for almost every single one of our clients, which means that they're interviewing via Zoom, or Teams, or whatever their communication practice is.

And they also come from this disadvantage in some ways where they might not know how to bring up a resume, because they don't have the experience set. And so we spend a lot of time working with both employers and candidates of, how do you really focus on skills instead of experience?

ANDY SERWER: And how much of this stuff is going to last after COVID?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I think that's the million dollar question, Andy. And some of what we're seeing is the flexibility of it-- of offering that as part of your brand, as part of your values as a company, that's going to last. I think the days of we're 100% at work and 100% at home, those extremes are going to evolve more towards the middle. You might have summer Fridays, you might have a more flexible workforce allowing people to work a little bit more than standard hours. But that flexibility is what candidates are rewarding employers about. So employers are going to be forced to think outside the lines going forward.

ANDY SERWER: I want to get back to the stimulus package. Do you think that's going to make a meaningful difference for the job market?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I think it's going to have to. There's two things that are really happening is that there was a really big part of the frontline employees during the first several months of COVID, and really through July, that weren't looking to go back to work. Because of the stimulus checks that they were getting, they were essentially making more by not putting themselves at-risk in these front-line, COVID-infected industries.

And so as the vaccine comes through the country, that proposition is going to become hopefully less and less attractive, and it's going to force some of these candidates to want to come back to work. And the other side on small businesses is really where we're looking from the other side of the stimulus checks-- you mentioned the candidate side-- but the employer side is also really important, because watching that small and medium-sized business sentiment is really important for the economic recovery that we're all going through. And the last few months, it's declined for small businesses-- that sentiment index that we all follow.

ANDY SERWER: Do you have any thinking on the amount of the stimulus-- too much, too little, or where it should be?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I will tell you that our view, and our clients' views-- and we work with most of the Fortune 500-- is clarity and transparency is more important even than the number-- it's getting out there with a plan and a timeline of how do we get back to some sense of normalcy and stability is what businesses are craving.

ANDY SERWER: Included is the $15 minimum wage. Some people say that kills job growth. What do you think?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: We haven't talked a lot in the media and in general is we spend a lot of time talking about work-from-home roles. But one of the things that this $15 minimum wage starts to open up the conversation around is, what about all those workers that are front-line workers-- that we want them to come back into those industries. We need them in those industries.

And one of the things that we're seeing is a really big migration of those workers not wanting to go into those spaces. They are preferring and opting to go to work-from-home roles-- whether it's call center jobs, whether it's office jobs. And so one of the things that we're seeing is something, a stimulus, to help really even out some of the distribution of the workforce.

ANDY SERWER: Some controversial stuff here, Irina-- some employers have looked to social media to see if prospective employees are members of white national groups or white supremacist groups. Are you hearing about that? And should they do that?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Social media-- and we tell this to the candidates, and we tell this as we work with a lot of hiring practices with our clients-- social media is one of the boxes that almost every single recruiting function we work with checks. So whether you're coming through college and you're graduating, whether you are just out there on social media, you should expect that your potential future employer and your existing employer are checking your social media profiles.

One of the things that has become really important and highlighted more in COVID, and has been important before, is what the company's values are. And so companies are spending a lot more time making sure that not only are they transparently sharing what their values are and continuing to honor those, but also, are their employees doing the same?

And social media is one of those things that it's out there. It's going to keep happening. And if you have something that shouldn't be on there, you shouldn't be posting it. But we as leaders want to make sure that our employees are bearing the values that we have out there.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned companies sort of becoming more political, or at least taking a stand politically, or making those views known. How much of that has to do with signaling to their workers where they stand?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: I would say, Andy, that, at least in my view, it's less about the political nature of it, and it's more about the right and wrong. As leaders, one of the things that we not only have a responsibility to our employees, but also as leaders of companies is we have this rare opportunity, especially right now, with what we call the great re-hire, to really change what the workforce looks like in our own companies-- what the faces of our workforce look like.

And so a lot of this is not political. It's, how do we make sure that we have a diverse group of people that are working for us? How do we make sure that it's not just diversity, but also inclusion? And that starts with what we say, how we say it, the holidays that we recommend and that we respect, the words we use, the hiring practices we make. So it's this fulsome and really full view of what it means to be a leader at the company, and as a result, to be employed at that business.

ANDY SERWER: Some people have suggested that former aides to President Trump might have a hard time getting jobs. Do you think that major employers might shut them out?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Again, it depends less on your experience and what your values are and what you did. One of the things that we speak a lot about is you want to make sure that you are pushing forward the right mission, that you are bringing in people that believe in that mission. And that might align with certain companies, and it most likely might not align with all of them.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Back to COVID-19 a little bit, Irina-- the downturn has hurt low income workers more than upper income workers. So it's kind of exacerbating a divide here. Why is that? And what can be done about that, do you think?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: And not only the low income workers-- one of the things that we're also seeing is there's really been a divide around just the race inequality that has been happening. So the unemployment for black Americans is almost double that of white Americans. And so we're seeing, essentially, this hollowing out that that's happening. And as far as what can be done from an employer perspective, it's a few things.

One, you want a diverse workforce, you have to advertise where there is diversity. One of the things that we talk about at CareerBuilder is we happen to be one of the more diverse job boards out there. And so whether it's us or with somebody else, how do you stay in front of where the diverse candidates are?

Two, it's really-- and we touched on this a little bit, Andy, but this is so critical for where we're going, and as we go into this great re-hire and post-COVID years, is really how this openness and flexibility around job mobility. And that comes around the skill set. We for so long have been hiring based on experience. And a lot of what that yields is the same demographic outcome for the same type of roles.

And one of the things that we have to start moving towards is a skill set view instead of experience. And instead of asking, have you done it? Asking, can you do it? And that starts opening up a completely different pool of candidates. I'll give you one experience-- one example that we've done from a technology perspective is as you know, over the first few months of COVID and really over the last few months is flight attendants have been really impacted by the minimal travel that has been happening.

And so there was this whole cohort of workers that were looking for jobs. And so instead of looking on their experience, we did matching based on their skill set, and they had an over 95% match to customer service representatives. So they'd never actually done that role based on their resume or their experience, but they had all the underlying skill sets of communication, of problem solving, of logistics handling.

And it happens that those customer service reps are one of the highest in-demand jobs that we had with not enough supply. And so all of a sudden, you're fixing this market mismatch using technology as long as employers are keeping a little bit more of an open mind around it and also candidates, so that they're not leading with, here's what I've done, and I'll only interview with that. But here's what I can do. And so we're going to have to see a lot more of that to impact a lot of the changes that need to happen.

ANDY SERWER: Interesting stuff. You said something that caught my ear there, Irina, which is the great re-hiring. Is that what you're calling what we hope to see in 2021?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: It is. And it represents not just the bringing back of the American workforce, but also bringing back diversity to all the American companies that are part of this. And so we have spent a lot of time on helping our clients prepare for this great re-hiring. Some of it is just building pipeline, Andy, because a lot of the questions you asked around the stimulus, and the timeline of COVID, and when are we going to be back-- and the answer is, nobody really knows.

And so how do you prepare for this uncertainty-- and a lot of that is building a talent pool so that when we are ready, you have these people to pull from. And we talk about this often-- that in recessions or in economic downturns, the companies that emerge the fastest are those that invest. And whether it's investing in your marketing spend, in your technology, investing in your people can be one of the best returns on investment and one of the most important ones.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of recovery, Irina, what sectors or companies will fare better or worse than what people expect as we recover?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Gaming companies, we're seeing a really big push. We're seeing companies around anything with financial services and insurance services. It's actually stayed-- not only is the recovery expected to be a little better, but we've also seen pretty consistent growth during COVID as well. And then the roles aspect is also really interesting, because sometimes it's not necessarily the industry, but the underlying roles across many different industries.

And around the roles, we're seeing a really big push in software developers, accountants are in a big shortage. So if you're thinking about what to recertify or where to retrain, we post several of these. But there's definitely a lot of these roles that are in high demand and not a lot of supply today.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned flight attendants. What about the poor hospitality business? How is that going to recover? What do you anticipate there?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: We saw some promises of growth in August. And when they started showing up in the top 10, obviously, in Q4, we saw a dip again. But one of the things that hospitalities is looking for is they're also building their pipeline for the future-- that one of the things they're preparing for is instead of a u-shaped recovery, a v-shape. That as soon as people are getting vaccinated, there's an expectation that people are going to hit the hospitality sector pretty quickly-- of wanting to travel, wanting to get out there, because they've been cooped up for the last several months.

So the industries-- those industries particularly are really spending a lot of time with us, of how do they plan to have a workforce get to work really quickly, versus some of the other ones are expecting a little bit more of a u.

ANDY SERWER: I want to go back to the diversity points that you were making a little bit, Irina. And last September, you called gender and race inequality in hiring, disturbing. And have things started to change as the world has changed as we move into 2021, do you think?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Not enough. I will say that the conversation is continuing to stay top of mind, which is really good to hear. One of the things that I continuously talk to CEOs and CHRs of our clients about is they're asking, where can they continue to get diverse talent? And previously, it was something that was a nice to have, a metric that a company was measuring themselves on, but it is much more top of mind and here to stay from a conversation perspective.

But when you look at the data, it's going to be lagging some of the activities that we're seeing. And it's continuing to lag when you look at unemployment, when you look at some of the wage discrepancies, they're really alarming-- that Black Americans are making 61% of median white household income, and that only went up from 57% in the 1970s.

So the progress has been really slow over the last few decades. But I am really hopeful and optimistic based on what I'm hearing that the activity is starting to be not only consistent but very top of mind for many employers.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, do CEOs get this?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: They understand it. And it's one of the most important things that we can do as CEOs. And not only is it good for culture and engagement, but it's also good for your bottom line. There is a lot of studies out there that say when you have a diverse pool of talent compared to your competitors that don't, you're outperforming your P&L by 25% to 30%, your stock prices perform better, your teams work better, you get more innovation. So there's data-- not only is it a good thing from a morale and an employee perspective, it's also just good for business.

ANDY SERWER: Irina, let me shift gears a little bit and ask you about you. You and your parents immigrated from Ukraine when you were young. And my understanding is you started off as a kid washing cars in your neighborhood. How did that shape the way you approach your work and your career?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Andy, I did anything. I sold water bottles at garage sales. You name it, I was doing it. But it shaped it a lot. It shaped-- when I think about when we came here, we came as refugees, as you mentioned, in the late-80s during a recession.

My parents didn't know a lot of English. We weren't able to take almost anything with us, so we came with $270 and a few suitcases. And it was interesting to see just so much of my wanting to really work and help drive CareerBuilder came from that early immigration experience, because how do you translate your work experience if you don't have tools to help you do that?

And so one of the things I would do with my dad-- and he had a PhD in engineering-- and it's hard to figure out how to take mechanical engineering from Russian to turn it into English. And I would watch him send thousands and thousands of resumes out. And it's really inspiring to see now that we're putting technology in front of people that can just literally help them do that translation by putting in the role. And it helps them write their resume for them.

But it's influenced-- every part of my life it's influenced, from a work ethic, from an appreciation perspective, from a hard work mentality. But it's something that stays with you.

ANDY SERWER: And what do you think the keys to your own success are, Irina? What is your-- I mean, sounds like hard work and determination definitely, but what is your key skill set?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: One of the things that-- and we talk about it, but it's something I have a lot of pride in-- is the team that I'm able to build and the team that is willing to come and work with me is really important. And it's a diverse team. It's diverse thought. One of the things that I've really spent a lot of time on is, how do I hire people that are better, smarter, wiser than me?

Because the exciting thing about being part of a team is them telling you ideas and pushing you. And it's also exciting for me, because we all want to be learning animals. We want to continuously improve. And putting yourself and surrounding yourself with people that push you to do that, it's very contagious. And it feeds off each other. And so that would be one of the biggest things, I would say.

ANDY SERWER: And you worked, what, on Wall Street, and went to business school at the same time, and had to pay for the school, and all of that, right?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Well, so, again, I was putting myself through college. And so I was able to get a job on Wall Street. I actually went to NYU's undergrad business school because it was in New York. And so I knew it would allow me to have internships. And I had jobs that I didn't have a degree-- and really leverage those skills instead of that experience top track that we talked about.

But I was able to find the minimum wage jobs-- sometimes it was a few of them-- to help pay for school. And it gave me such a different experience that I was able to get access to all these different jobs before graduating and working all these different roles. And not only that, but it allowed me also to pay for school, which is always nice when you definitely need to finance your own education.

ANDY SERWER: What advice do you have for others, maybe especially young women, who want to achieve that same level of professional success?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: The number one thing I would say is believing in yourself. Especially coming through finance and moving into operations, it's really important that sometimes you might be the only one at the table that is your first of your kind-- whatever it is, a woman, whether you are a man at the table with all women, whether you're a Black American, white American, Hispanic-- but it's really being focused on believing in yourself and not really taking, no, for an answer.

One of the things I always talk about at CareerBuilder is you're either asking the wrong person, or you're asking the wrong question. And so how do you really push through that? And sometimes it's a lot easier to listen to the negative sayers or to the negative perspectives out there than to really continue to believe and push forward. And hard work-- a lot of it is hard work. It's continuing to stay at it-- you know more than anybody, Andy. And a little luck doesn't help-- doesn't hurt.

ANDY SERWER: All right, let me ask you the most important question of this interview, which is, how did you get your job at CareerBuilder?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Well, it's interesting. I happened to get a phone call from Apollo that owns CareerBuilder and the board of CareerBuilder. And they were looking for somebody that would really believe in the mission, which is about empowering employment. And they wanted somebody to help really capitalize on the growth opportunities that were there for the business.

And it's a 25-year-old brand that is pretty well-known and one of the leaders in the employment space. And they wanted to bring somebody in that had passion for employment and for what could be really realized with CareerBuilder. And, Andy, you asked about my immigrant experience, and those two really overlapped for me. To go through really that kind of childhood that I went through, I have just such an appreciation on how employment can be really a great equalizer on so many different levels.

And having an ability to influence that in some way is just something that's really exciting for me. And the team it's-- where our mission-driven values come from, it's why we come every day to work to see how we can help have a little bit of an impact on the world we're in.

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you a little bit more about CareerBuilder-- what's the business model? How does it make money?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Yes. So we are a two-sided marketplace. So we are one of the largest job advertising sites. We have over 160 million candidate profiles. So for candidates, it's absolutely free. They come and look for different job openings, they post their resume, and then on the employer side, we work with the majority of the Fortune 500, most of the small and medium-sized businesses-- again, we're one of the largest. And they essentially pay us to advertise their jobs to those 160 million candidates that we have. So it's essentially a matching service for jobs.

ANDY SERWER: What are mistakes or maybe the biggest mistake that applicants make?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Not really reviewing what they're posting. Grammar-- there is a lot of mistakes on grammar. Not highlighting their skill set is a second one. A lot of people spend a lot of time on their experience, but they don't pull out what is it that they did at their experience. And then really what they're looking for as well-- again, highlighting their skill set.

But the employers make a lot of mistakes as well. One of the things that we've seen is the biggest employer mistakes is the job description-- is whether it's written biased, or it's not as inclusive as it can be. And it's actually the biggest reason, Andy, that candidates don't click on a job or don't want to apply for a job is based on the job description.

ANDY SERWER: And similar kind of question-- what's your top advice for people applying for jobs during the pandemic?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Make yourself as available as possible. So make sure that you are where recruiters are looking, that you are on the top job sites, that you are attending virtual networking events, that you're attending virtual hiring events. And sometimes that means that you might get a few rejections, but you're going into their queue, you're going into their pipeline.

And one of the things that we do with all of our clients is we re-engage past candidates. The majority of our matches are based on our recommendation engine, which reengages candidates. So making sure that you're out there and in front-- and also, again, highlighting the skill set. And we talked about this a little bit, but the economy is changing, roles are changing.

Postal meter readers used to be one of the biggest roles out there, and that doesn't exist anymore. And so how do you pivot that if you're in a role that no longer has a lot of demand, how do you make sure that you are considered for your skill set into other industries?

ANDY SERWER: And final question, Irina-- you have many more years ahead of you in your career. So I'm going to ask you one of those, again, job interview questions-- where do you see yourself in 10, 15, 20 years? What do you hope to accomplish?

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Andy, I will tell you that one of the things that has made me successful and has allowed me to do what I do is I really focus on the present and the now. And it's hard to think too far out. I think one of the important things for me in the role that I do is I really wanted to be part of helping to build American culture. And I feel so grateful to be in this country and have had the opportunities that I do-- that in every role that I'm in, I really try to see if I can leave some sort of mark on what has made this country great.

And so it's not a great, clear answer for you, Andy. But it's how do I stay focused on what I'm doing? And it's helping employ America, and helping get that American re-hire going, and making sure that I'm getting and giving the best to my employees, and leaving a little bit of a mark on a country that's left a huge, huge mark on me.

ANDY SERWER: No, I think it's a great, clear answer-- I have to disagree with you. A great answer.

[LAUGHTER]

Thank you so much, Irina Novoselsky. Thank you very much for your time.

IRINA NOVOSELSKY: Thank you, Andy. It's a pleasure.

169,2021-02-04T00:45:31+00:00,"Sony Surges to 20-Year High as IPhone, Games Spur Outlook Hike","(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. surged to a 20-year high after raising its annual operating income outlook by 34%, banking on robust games sales and Apple Inc.’s iPhone 12.

The Tokyo-based company now expects to make 940 billion yen ($8.9 billion) in the fiscal year ending March, up from 700 billion previously. It’s forecasting a pickup in divisions spanning pictures, music and games as well as its imaging unit providing camera sensors for iPhones and other devices.

Shares jumped as much as 10.4% in Tokyo on Thursday, their biggest intraday gain since May 2019.

The newly launched PlayStation 5 sold 4.5 million units in its debut period despite production challenges limiting its availability. Sony is on track to surpass its goal of 7.6 million units by end of March and aims for a further 14.8 million or more in the next fiscal year, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said. Demand for the games machine has exceeded Sony’s expectations, but component shortages across the industry may prevent the company from increasing production beyond its existing plans.

“We are doing our best on production so that we can ship as many units as possible at the earliest timing,” the CFO said. The PS5 will continue to be sold at a loss next fiscal year, but the impact would be “neutral” once peripherals and PS4 sales are factored in, he added.

Sony also added 1.5 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, taking it to 47.4 million, and sold 4.1 million copies of its flagship Spider-Man game. The subscriber growth and software sales helped Sony beat all analyst estimates with 359.2 billion yen in operating profit for the quarter ended December. Demand for camera hardware from the iPhone 12 helped shore up Sony’s semiconductor business and that division should rebound in 2021, said Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst Damian Thong. Sony resumed supplying image sensors to a “major Chinese customer,” Totoki said, without specifying which company.

“In addition to boosting hardware supply, Sony should make a bunch of PlayStation 5 games ready in the next fiscal year to push PS4 owners to move over to the new system,” said Morningstar Research analyst Kazunori Ito.

The PlayStation business is Sony’s top contributor and Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida has told other units of the group that they should follow the same path in building a recurring revenue model. The company registered record subscriber numbers for its PlayStation Plus service in 2020 on the strength of stay-at-home entertainment demand.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

“Digital downloads accounted for about half of full-game sales in 2019 and 55-60% in 2020 and may continue to gain until it approaches the 90%+ of PC games, though the pace of gains may slow from the five points per year shift experienced pre-Covid.”

Further subscriber growth for Sony’s services is limited, however, as most of the potential audience of gamers who’d consider joining may already be signed up, Nomura Securities analyst Yu Okazaki said before results were released. Signaling the importance of those digital subscribers to Sony’s bottom line, he expects the company’s operating profit from the game unit to be roughly flat for the next few years.

“Sony’s recurring business model is targeting a niche market of enthusiastic fans and thus its new member sign-up pace is likely to slow down,” Okazaki said.

Top 5 Dow Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio in a Capricious Market

Wall Street witnessed a spike in volatile trading last week primarily owing to a typical trading practice in which a few key heavily shorted stocks by hedge fund giants were favored by a group of individual investors organized via Reddit’s wallstreet bets forum. Moreover, a slower-than-expected rollout of COVID-19 vaccines also dented investors confidence to some extent.

A section of market participants have already raised concerns regarding a bubble in the market. All the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — suffered their worst weekly performance since October 2020 in last week.

The stock-market volatility is likely to continue in the days to come. Despite an unpredictable market, five Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are likely to provide solid returns in the near term. Investment in these stocks at this stage is likely to be prudent.

Markets May Remain Volatile in Near Future

Wall Street is expected to continue fluctuating in the near future as we are reeling under the resurgence of coronavirus and its newly found mutated strings. Nationwide vaccination is still a long way to go.

Moreover, the recent spike in prices of some highly shorted stocks fueled by the Reddit-based platform is spiraling into the metals market. On Feb 1, the prices of silver futures surged 8% to $29.06 per ounce, marking the largest single-day gain on NYMEX since Feb 15, 2013.

Story continues

Furthermore, discount online brokerage firm Robinhood said that it has mobilized $3.4 billion from retail investors since Jan 28 amid extreme market volatility. The figure exceeds the total amount that the online broker has raised since its inception in 2013.

Persistence of volatility is evident from the COBE VIX reading  — popularly known as the best fear-gauge of Wall Street. In a nutshell, the VIX indicates the market's expectation of a 30-day forward-looking volatility based on the near-term S&P 500 Index options (both puts and calls).

Notably, VIX is currently hovering in the range of 30 to 35 while it was in the range of 20 to 25 in December and January. At its current level, the fear gauge is well above its long-term reading at around 20.

At its current level of 30.24, the VIX is higher than its 50-day moving average of 23.47 and the 200-day moving average of 27.38. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trend setter while the 200-day moving average is the long-term trend setter. This clearly indicates that the market will remain volatile and stocks may swing widely in either direction in the near future.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed down our search to five Dow stocks that have strong growth potential for both short and long-term (3-5 years) and have witnessed robust earnings estimate revisions in the last 7 to 30 days. All these stocks carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Apple's Services and Wearables businesses are expected to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Although its business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the new cash cow. The company's focus on autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality technologies presents growth opportunities in the long haul.

The Zacks Rank #1 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 36.3% for the current year (ending September 2021). It has a long-term growth rate of 11.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 10.9% over the last 7 days.

The Goldman Sachs Group's key source of earnings stability is its business diversification. Within traditional banking, a diversified product portfolio has better chances of sustaining growth than many other banks, which have exited some of these areas. It operates in four segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management.

The Zacks Rank #1 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.4% for the current year. It has a long-term growth rate of 19.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 12.9% over the last 30 days.

Microsoft has a dominant position in the desktop PC market, with its operating systems being used in the majority of PCs worldwide. The company has doubled down on the cloud computing opportunity. Moreover, it is one of the three largest providers of gaming hardware.

The Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 26.9% for the current year (ending June 2021). It has a long-term growth rate of 11.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 8.6% over the last 7 days.

The Travelers Companies provides a range of commercial and personal property, and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals in the United states and internationally. It operates through three segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance.

The Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 10.6% for the current year. It has a long-term growth rate of 6.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 2.2% over the last 7 days.

Intel Corp.'s primary focus area is the data center and cloud, where it is doing everything possible to maintain its market share and profitability. It operates through Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, Programmable Solutions Group, Client Computing Group and All Other segments.

Although the Zacks Rank #2 company has a negative expected earnings growth rate for the current year, it has a long-term growth rate of 7.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days.

Zacks Names “Single Best Pick to Double”

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it’s poised for a monster turnaround. Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Ford Motor Company F, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. CFG, Ally Financial Inc. ALLY and Capital One Financial Corporation COF.

Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:

Top Momentum Stocks for February Despite Recent Turmoil

Wall Street halted in the first month of this year after rallying in the last two months of the previous year. In January, the Dow and the S&P 500 lost 2% and 1.1%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.7%. For the week ended Jan 29, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.2%, 3.3% and 3.5%, respectively, posting their worst weekly performance since October 2020.

However, a closer look at last week's trading pattern clearly revealed that it was not any major economic, financial or political factor that led to a meltdown. A typical trading practice in which a few key heavily shorted stocks by hedge fund giants were favored by a group of individual investors organized via Reddit's wallstreetbets forum.

Market's volatility may persist for a few more days as a section of market participants have already raised concerns regarding a bubble in the market. Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain stable and the northbound journey of Wall Street is likely to resume soon.

Momentum Likely to Continue

Momentum investing calls for continued appraisal of stocks, ensuring that an investor does not pick a beaten-down name or overlook a thriving one. Momentum investors buy high on the anticipation that a stock will only ascend in the short to intermediate term. Although coronavirus-induced woes are persisting in the United States, causing occasional market fluctuations, the overall movement of Wall Street is likely to remain northbound due to the five main drivers.

Story continues

First, President Joe Biden and his administration has decided to meet the Trump administration's goal of immunizing 100 million people in 100 days despite a slower-than-expected rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. This means that the economy should reopen and gradually operate at the pre-pandemic level. Since the lockdowns imposed in March, the U.S. economy is operating at a significant sub-optimal level.

Second, President Joe Biden proposed a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid package called ""American Rescue Plan."" The proposed plan will include increasing direct payments to $2,000 from the existing $600 and supplemental unemployment benefits to $400 per week through September.  It will provide support to small businesses and aid to state and local governments.

Third, on Jan 26, the IMF raised its global growth forecast for 2021 to 5.5% from 5.2% projected in October 2020. The agency reduced its projected global GDP contraction rate for 2020 to 3.5% from 4.4% in October. On Jan 5, the World Bank reported that the global economy is likely to grow 4% after an estimated 4.3% contraction in 2020.

Both agencies have said that the developed countries will be less affected owing to unprecedented fiscal support and major central banks' decision to pursue ultra-dovish monetary policies.

Fourth, the fourth-quarter earnings season has started with better-than-expected results. Strong overall earnings results and future guidance will support the current stock market valuation.

As of Jan 29, the fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 Index were projected to be down 2.6% year over year on 1.5% higher revenues. This is a notable improvement over the projection of a 7.8% decline in earnings on 0.3% higher revenues at the beginning of the reporting cycle.

Fifth, the Conference Board reported that its Consumer Confidence Index for the month of January improved moderately and came in at 89.3 compared to 87.1 in December which was revised downward from 88.6 reported earlier. The metric surpassed the consensus estimate of 87.5. Notably, the Expectations Index, which is a measure of consumers' short-term (for the next six months) outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, increased from 87.0 in December to 92.5 in January.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Who are your role models, Mabarak, in terms of tech CEOs and leaders and maybe people in other fields of endeavor. For instance, Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Do you, do you look to them?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I'd say I look to Bill Gates quite a bit from an aspect of competitiveness and from an aspect of focus, because he has this ability to look at things and look at them to a level that, until he gets what he wants. But I think what I borrow mostly, who I borrow mostly from is Warren Buffett, because I think Warren Buffett represents, he represents a mature American business person that is so neatly organized and thorough and to the point.

ANDY SERWER: Have you ever met Warren Buffett or been to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: No, but I will one day.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the rest of your career and your life, Mubarak? You're only 26 years old. What are your aspirations? What do you hope to achieve over the next decade and throughout your lifetime?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: You know, I think the most important thing is to figure out a way in which I can make enterprise software basically accessible to all. That's around the world, just not in Africa. Thanks to statistics and newly acquired information that informs insight on multiple things. So I think for the foreseeable decade that, I think, is what I really want to achieve, because what we've been able to do is make enterprise software standard, which was something that was really not possible in the past.

ANDY SERWER: And last question, Mubarak if you could ask Warren Buffett one question, what would it be?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I'd say investment, but then, yeah, I'd say investments.

ANDY SERWER: You'd ask him about investment?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Right. Not actually investment, but actually, ask him to invest with me.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Oh, you would ask him to invest. Right. Good one. Love it. All right, we're going to have to leave it there, Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace. Thank you so much for joining us, Mubarak.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Thank you.

182,2021-01-29T05:47:45+00:00,SK Hynix Sounds Upbeat Note on Chip Demand After Tripling Profit,"(Bloomberg) -- Memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc.’s fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled after lockdowns and stay-at-home orders boosted demand for PCs and purchases from Chinese smartphone makers.

Hynix struck a more optimistic tone than rival Samsung Electronics Co., which warned a day earlier of weakness in the first quarter. The supplier of silicon to Apple Inc. said Friday that it expects the memory market to recover, but warned of uncertainty over disruptions to supply from the pandemic and tightening global chipmaking capacity.

“Demand this year is going to be much more positive than the supply side,” said MS Park, Hynix vice president for DRAM marketing. “Both the market and customers appear to be upwardly adjusting their outlook.”

Operating profit rose to 965.9 billion won ($860 million) in the three months ended December, beating the 928 billion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed about 15% to 7.97 trillion won. Shares rose in Seoul after the report.

While Hynix no longer supplies memory chips to Huawei Technologies Co. because of U.S. sanctions that took effect in September, Chinese smartphone makers including Oppo and Xiaomi Corp. are increasing orders. Apple’s earnings for the holiday quarter jumped more than analysts expected on sales of the iPhone 12, its first device for 5G wireless networks. Demand for servers and gaming consoles is also rising which is likely to continue this year.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:

“SK Hynix’s DRAM shipments in 2021 may grow in the high teens or as much as 20%, while NAND shipments this year could rise in the low 30s in percentage terms, as management expects.”

- Masahiro Wakasugi and Anthea Lai, analysts

Click here for the research.

Hynix signaled there may be shortages in the memory chip market, as demand growth for DRAM is likely to exceed supply because of increasing use in data-center servers and 5G smartphones. The auto industry has been struggling with semiconductor shortages that have led to plant closures across the industry.

The company is expediting its two-year plan to relocate 8-inch foundry equipment from its M8 fab in Cheongju, South Korea, to its fab in Wuxi, China in order to cut costs and address booming demand.

Hynix also said that while its capital spending will increase compared to last year, the extent will be limited, despite opening its M16 fabrication facility. It is planning prudent spending given uncertainties in the market.

Bit growth, or the amount of memory produced, exceeded expectations in the fourth quarter thanks to stronger-than-expected demand, Hanwha Investment & Securities said in a research note. Inventories recovered to a normal level toward the end of the year, a positive sign for chipmakers, Hanwha said.

Hynix peers including Micron Technology Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. issued upbeat outlooks for the first quarter as demand is recovering for chips that go into PCs, automobiles and servers. Samsung said it expects the market for DRAM memory chips to rebound in the first half with solid sales for mobile and rebounding data-center demand.

DRAM prices are set to increase starting in the first quarter as rising orders from mobile-device makers bring inventories down, while producers tighten capacity, said Jaeyun Lee, an analyst at Yuanta Securities. “This means that the timing of rebound has been brought forward by 2-3 months,” Lee said.

184,2021-01-28T17:57:31+00:00,12 Most Famous Monopolies Of All Time,"In this article we are going to list the 12 most famous monopolies of all time. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Most Famous Monopolies of All Time.

There was a long time when entrepreneurship wasn't really considered to be a very viable option for the vast majority of people in the world. Only the upper class people could consider going into business on their own, while the middle class and the lower class would work 9 to 5 jobs, and then go home to their families. However, nowadays, more and more people are fed up of the normal office job life and it's easy to see why. At least when you're in public service such as a police officer or a doctor, you are actually making a difference and helping to improve the world and improve the lives of people as well. But when you're simply in a normal job for the corporation, all you're doing is taking home a meagre salary and actually helping the corporation make all the money, which is why many people are much more interested in starting their business.

When you start your own business, you need investment from people. Even this part is becoming much easier thanks to funding websites which allow you to ask for investment by people into your product, as well as the improvement in globalization. And of course, when you start your own business, then you want it to grow and grow and become huge, earning you a windfall as your company becomes world famous. However, there is a certain threshold after which the company cannot continue to grow, not because it has reached its peak, but because it is gaining too much power and influence and disrupting the flow of a free economy.

Of course, I'm talking about the creation of a monopoly. So what exactly is a monopoly? A monopoly comes into being when only one seller or an enterprise is engaged in the business of any specific commodity. Why is this an issue, you may be asking? After all, if there's just one major company, then doesn't that mean that company has achieved economies of scale and can actually sell the product to you cheaper and can end up being entirely beneficial to everyone involved? Well, not exactly. You see, in a monopoly, there is no competition whatsoever, and it is competition which drives everyone to succeed and consistently better themselves. Imagine if you were the only employee in your company who could do a certain task and there were no available substitutes at all which meant that you were irreplaceable. Would you give the same effort you'd give in a normal environment trying to succeed and compete with fellow professionals or would you just phone in your work and laze around, since the company can't harm you any way. The latter is the much more common option, and in the same way, the monopoly won't work hard and pass of all the savings to you. In fact, due to the fact that there are no other suppliers, and hence, no viable substitutes, the company can charge as much as it wants and you'd be bound to pay the amount, which is exactly why monopolies are a major issue.

Story continues 12 most famous monopolies of all time

Kritchanut/Shutterstock.com

This is why by law, a monopoly is defined as an entity which has significant market power, which includes the ability to charge extremely high prices and prevent the entry of competition. The company doesn't necessarily have to be extremely large, although you'll find most of the 12 most famous monopolies of all time to be so. Instead, a company may be a monopoly even if it isn't very large but is the only player in a small industry. Now, it might seem anti-capitalistic to put limits to the growth of a company, but actually this move is pro-capitalistic, ensuring everyone has a chance to enter the industry, though yes, the move has been mostly geared towards protecting the welfare of citizens and to all the naysayers, this is actually a good move! In fact, it is a great move. Imagine if there was just one pharmaceutical company making all the essential medicine in the world. You need it to survive and yet the company could charge whatever price it wanted, possibly quickly bankrupting you. Or if there was just one car company, which refused to incorporate safety features and sold a below average car for extremely high prices. Again, you'd be powerless especially if you lived in a country with little public transport infrastructure. Or even if an oil company was a monopoly, and this is a real life example which you'll learn more about further on in the greatest monopolies of all time.

Monopolies have been present throughout history, though some have gained much more fame than the others. In fact, if one company acquires another company, even that transaction has separate laws to ensure that the acquisition won't result in the creation of a monopoly and such acquisition deals can be reversed by the relevant regulatory authorities to ensure a fair and free market remains. Even now, when such laws are much more strict than they used to be, there are cries of some companies effectively being monopolies and having way too much power. These companies include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because of its app store, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) because of its search dominance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) because of its operating system two decades ago and even AT&T (NYSE:T), which itself is a descendant of one of the most famous monopolies in history. Tech companies have come more under fire though, as their influence is completely unparalleled and there have been talks of breaking companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon, to ensure that their dominance does not remain. Now that Joe Biden has become the new President of the United States, and Democrats have gained control of both the House and the Senate, it does look like there might be a day of reckoning for these companies soon enough. But till, then let's sink our teeth into monopolies that achieved both fame and infamy simultaneously, starting with number 12:

12. Salt Commission

We start off with the oldest organization in our list, for which we have to go back more than 1,200 years, in China. The Salt Commission was an organization created by the State, which had a monopoly on the salt trade in the country. The purpose of the organization was to collect tax from salt trade, and the funny thing is, it took till 2014 for the announcement to be made regarding ending the monopoly on the salt trade by the government.

11. Thurn and Taxis Mail

The private company operated postal service back in the 1800s and enjoyed a monopoly on postal services. The company's dominance came to an end after Prussian victory, after which it transferred over its assets to Prussia. Highest Paying Part-Time Jobs for College Students

10. Hudson's Bay Company

The company had a monopoly on the fur trade in Canada, and is a Canadian company. The company enjoyed this monopoly until the end of 1849, where its power was finally weakened and it had to secede some of the market share it enjoyed over the last couple of centuries. Best Tinder Bios for Tall Guys

9. Luxottica (ESLOF)

It owns nearly every major eyewear brand you've heard of, including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Sears and many more, and has been accused of monopolistic pricing of its premium brands.

8. Dutch East India Company

The company was established in the 17th century to trade with India and had a monopoly on the Dutch spice trade which was incredibly lucrative. The company is infamous for using its power as a monopoly to gain more money and influence, as well as using violence, slavery and colonialism as tactics to keep on growing.

7. Pan Am Airways

Pan Am was in existence from 1927 to 1991 as the largest American airline, and is said to have been a monopoly in the US, where it was also its unofficial flag carrier. Its main claim of being a monopoly came from its international routes, where there was no competition to the airline. 15 Countries with the Strictest Customs, Border Control and Airport Security in the World

6. De Beers

De Beers is one of the most controversial companies among the biggest monopolies of all time, which is saying something. The company is 133 years old and has operations in 35 countries regarding everything related to diamonds including its mining, retail, trading, exploration and manufacturing. It has mines in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Canada and Australia, and has controlled close to 85% of the total diamond trade globally from inception till the start of the 21st, making it a through and through monopoly. While competition has broken the iron grip of the company, its power still remains with 30% of the market share.

185,2021-01-28T13:00:05+00:00,Samsung Net Profit Misses Estimates After 5G iPhone’s Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. missed analyst estimates for the fourth quarter and warned profitability will likely decline this quarter, citing weakness in its memory chip business and challenges with currency fluctuations.

South Korea’s biggest company reported net income in the three months ended December of 6.45 trillion won ($5.84 billion), missing the 7.3 trillion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares fell 2.2% in Seoul on Thursday.

Samsung, the world’s largest maker of memory chips and displays, struck a cautious tone that stood in contrast to that of many technology companies benefiting during the coronavirus lockdowns. Just hours earlier, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. reported financial results that handily exceed estimates.

“In the first quarter, we expect overall profitability to decline due to relative weakness in the memory and display businesses,” said Ben Suh, executive vice president of investor relations, during a call with investors. In the memory business, Samsung’s most important profit engine, “results are likely to weaken due to currency effects and continued costs associated with new fab ramp up.”

Operating profit for the semiconductor unit was 3.85 trillion won in the fourth quarter, short of the 4.62 trillion estimate from analysts. The company said it expects a recovery in the business in the first half.

Samsung said it’s tracking whether chip shortages that have hit the global auto industry could spill over to other sectors, including tech products.

“This is a global issue,” said Han Jinman, executive vice president of the memory business. “There is a possibility that the shortage of other semiconductor parts may impact mobile demand and so, we are carefully watching how that plays out.”

In the smartphone business, Samsung struggled in the holiday period as Apple introduced its first 5G-capable iPhones and Chinese rivals put up fierce competition. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company took over the No. 1 position in the fourth quarter, ahead of Samsung and China’s Xiaomi Corp., market research firms said on Thursday.

With a lot of good devices on the market, “there is only so much that Samsung can grab out of it,” said Kiranjeet Kaur, research manager at IDC.

Investors had anticipated Samsung could increase its dividend payout substantially, in part because the founding Lee family faces an enormous inheritance tax bill. Instead, the company said it would continue to return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2021 and 2023, although its annual dividend payout will increase slightly to 9.8 trillion won.

The results come just days after Samsung’s de-facto leader, billionaire heir Jay Y. Lee, was sent back to prison on bribery charges. Although professional managers lead the company’s operating units, Lee has played a central role in major strategic decisions.

The company signaled it will continue to press ahead with critical deals and investments. Samsung will use its capital to expand the capacity of its foundry business, which fabricates chips for clients like Nvidia Corp., to meet demand and overcome current supply shortages. It will also invest in facility expansions and “meaningful” acquisitions, the company said.

“For the last few years, we have been evaluating possible M&A opportunities very carefully and have made significant progress in terms of preparation,” Choi Yoon-ho, chief financial officer of Samsung, said during the earnings call. “Although it is difficult to pinpoint a specific timing due to uncertainties in the internal and external business environment ... we are optimistic of carrying out meaningful M&A activities during this term.”

Analysts including Yungsan Choi of Ebest Investment & Securities have been anticipating a long-awaited rebound in memory chip prices due to demand for servers and more powerful 5G smartphones. Component supplier Murata Manufacturing Co. and chipmaker MediaTek Inc. both anticipate more than half a billion 5G handsets to be shipped this year.

Chipmakers Intel Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. gave a bullish forecast for the first quarter of this year on continued demand for computers and phones that enable working and studying from home. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning another record-breaking year of investment with as much as $28 billion set aside to expand and improve its production capacity at a time of silicon supply shortages affecting everyone from global automakers to mobile tech giants like Apple and Qualcomm Inc.

Samsung’s contract chip manufacturing is expected to expand with the addition of Intel as a customer. The two companies have discussed development and production of Intel’s mainboard chipsets over the last two years and Samsung will produce the chipset at its Austin, Texas plant starting from this quarter, Meritz Securities said in a note.

Samsung Is Said to Mull $10 Billion Texas Chipmaking Plant

The existing Austin fab is capable of operating on a 14-nanometer process. With rising expectations of growth in the foundry market, Samsung is considering building a cutting-edge logic chipmaking plant in the region that would be capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3nm in the future, Bloomberg News reported earlier.

“Regarding investments including building a fab in the U.S., we haven’t made a decision yet,” said Shawn Han, senior vice president. “Due to the nature of foundry business that requires timely and efficient responses to customers’ demand, we routinely review capacity expansions. We continue to study ways to optimize operations at fabs in all regions from Giheung, Hwaseong to Austin.”

Video Transcript

- At some point, you applied to Harvard, though--

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Right.

- --and then got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: What was the case was this. When I won the award the very first time at national level, the thing became, what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, Chris Kirubi? So he had been an alumni of Harvard, so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school.

And he had gotten to almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time, so I was supported through the whole application process. And it was really an amazing experience, but then it got to a point, where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this on [? Zetia. ?] So it brought in, like, a new dynamic in the competition.

Because for the first time, what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds. They already had employees, and they were already competing. And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them, so it became a situation, where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead, so that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a weight on this.

And actually, what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of, like, three years by the time I came to think about it again.

Story continues

- Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to-- every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. And at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind, so I wouldn't say, I regret. I just think that there was a different path to take.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/business-growth-africa-depends-big-110000591.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0P00012B2W.TO', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'ASBCX.US', 'ASBFX.US', 'BB.US', 'CAAFX.US', 'CCAMX.US', 'CEAMX.US', 'CFAMX.US', 'CSCO.US', 'FB.US', 'FFTSX.US', 'FSBTX.US', 'FTSBX.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US']",['HARVARD'],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.187}"

Investing.com -- The tug of war continues between Wall Street hedge funds and an army of exuberant and sometimes grievance-driven retail traders. The first reading of U.S. fourth-quarter GDP is due, as are weekly jobless claims. Apple, Tesla and Facebook stock all struggle despite strong results, and oil has a tightening physical market to thank for withstanding the sell-off in stocks. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, January 28th

1 The Great Stonks Revolt

Buckle up, it’s going to be another wild day in the Great Stonks Revolt of 2021. Monday and Tuesday saw one of the biggest gross reductions in exposure to the market by hedge funds in the last decade, according to Morgan Stanley.

That’s down to the licking given to hedge funds and other pros by the army of retail traders organizing on Reddit and other social media. How long the movement can last isn’t clear. Unless the day traders actually want to be the long-term owners of failing game stores and debt laden, empty movie theaters, the urge to take profits may very soon start to become irresistible.

2. GDP, Jobless Claims due

For those still attached to the quaint notion that the state of the economy has any role in price formation for financial assets, the U.S. will announce its preliminary reading of fourth-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).

Analysts expect the economy to have grown at an annualized pace of 4%, a sharp slowdown from the 33% seen in the third quarter. Core personal consumer expenditures, the favored measure of inflation at the Federal Reserve, are seen rising 1.5% year-on-year.

At the same time, more timely data on the labor market will be released. Initial jobless claims are expected to have stayed at a high level of 875,000 last week. New home sales data for December completes the data roster.

3. Stocks set to open mixed

U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed after their sharpest one-day sell-off in weeks on Tuesday.

Story continues

By 6:35 AM (1135 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 10 points, less than 0.1%. S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq futures were down 0.8%.

The deluge of earnings continues, with both Mastercard (NYSE:MA) (early) and Visa (NYSE:V) (late) reporting, along with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Altria (NYSE:MO) and Dow (NYSE:DOW), Stanley Black&Decker (NYSE:SWK) and three of the country’s biggest airlines – American (NASDAQ:AAL), JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV).

4. Tesla, Apple can’t meet high expectations

Tesla recorded its first ever full year of profits, and Apple recorded its first ever quarter of $100 billion in revenue, but neither could live up to the sky-high expectations implicit in their current stock prices.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was marked down 4.9% in premarket trading after forecasting growth of only 50% in both of the next two years, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was indicated down 2.3%, despite raising the average selling price of its iPhone from $803 to $879 in the space of a year.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the other megacap to report after the bell on Wednesday, fell 0.5% after warning of regulatory challenges to its dominance of the online ad market, accompanied by some highly critical comments of Apple by its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.

5. Oil steady despite pressure on risk assets

The selling pressure in the stock market had only a limited effect on crude oil prices, which remain well supported by a steady drawdown in global inventories – illustrated by a sharp drop in U.S. stockpiles announced by the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.

By 6:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.2% at $52.77 a barrel, while Brent futures were down by a similar amount at $55.41 a barrel.

190,2021-01-28T05:17:37+00:00,Apple Takes Top Spot in Phone Market With Record Shipments,"(Bloomberg) -- Record iPhone shipments pushed Apple Inc. to the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market as Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Co. lost significant ground, market research firms said on Thursday.

Canalys and Counterpoint estimate iPhone shipments jumped to roughly 82 million units in the last quarter, marking a new high for Apple and crowning it the leading smartphone vendor. Samsung slumped more than 10% to just over 62 million shipments in a period that was marked by the release of the first 5G-enabled iPhones. Xiaomi Corp., Oppo and Vivo filled out the top five while Huawei suffered a 41% drop after U.S. sanctions deprived it of access to key suppliers and chipmakers.

“Huawei dramatically receded in most markets as the result of the U.S. sanctions,” said Canalys analyst Amber Liu. “Its decision to divest Honor, however, may prove vital, as Honor is not bound by the same restrictions and component supply is resuming.”

Huawei sold its budget-friendly sub-brand Honor at the end of the year, giving it a chance to regain supply of critical components. “Over the last year, our smartphone business has developed robustly, and tablet, PC and wearable have seen a significant growth. We remain confident about the future,” Huawei said in an email.

The new iPhones boosted Apple’s revenue to more than $100 billion for the first time, with Tim Cook telling analysts on Wednesday that customer response to the new models has been “enthusiastic even in light of the ongoing Covid-19.”

A widely predicted recovery from the coronavirus slump appears to be taking hold in the smartphone market. “Apple is championing 5G sales and it will be the catalyst for 5G adoption in many countries across the world,” said IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo. Executives at component maker Murata Manufacturing Co. and chipmaker MediaTek Inc. have said they expect to see half a billion 5G handsets shipped this year.

191,2021-01-28T05:17:37+00:00,Apple Takes Top Spot in Phone Market With Record Shipments,"(Bloomberg) -- Record iPhone shipments pushed Apple Inc. to the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market as Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Co. lost significant ground, market research firms said on Thursday.

Canalys and Counterpoint estimate iPhone shipments jumped to roughly 82 million units in the last quarter, marking a new high for Apple and crowning it the leading smartphone vendor. Samsung slumped more than 10% to just over 62 million shipments in a period that was marked by the release of the first 5G-enabled iPhones. Xiaomi Corp., Oppo and Vivo filled out the top five while Huawei suffered a 41% drop after U.S. sanctions deprived it of access to key suppliers and chipmakers.

“Huawei dramatically receded in most markets as the result of the U.S. sanctions,” said Canalys analyst Amber Liu. “Its decision to divest Honor, however, may prove vital, as Honor is not bound by the same restrictions and component supply is resuming.”

Huawei sold its budget-friendly sub-brand Honor at the end of the year, giving it a chance to regain supply of critical components. “Over the last year, our smartphone business has developed robustly, and tablet, PC and wearable have seen a significant growth. We remain confident about the future,” Huawei said in an email.

192,2021-01-27T19:25:33+00:00,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: There is ‘a big crisis right now’ for cybersecurity,"Microsoft (MSFT) is officially a cybersecurity giant. For the first time on Tuesday, Microsoft disclosed revenue from its various security offerings as part of its quarterly earnings — $10 billion over the last 12 months.

That amounts to a 40% year-over-year jump in the growing security business, making up roughly 7% of the company’s total revenue for the previous year.

“We waited in some sense [until] this milestone to show the depth, the breadth, the span of what we are doing,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Wednesday, a day after the company released its quarterly earnings report.

“And, you know, [there’s] a lot of work ahead, but we are investing very heavily because guess what? You know 10 years from now we'll still be talking about it as technology becomes even [a deeper part] of our lives in our society in all critical industries.”

The $10 billion figure comes from the security-related revenue generated by services including Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory, Intune, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Office 365, Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Information and Governance, Azure Sentinel, Azure Monitoring, and Azure Information Protection.

Each of those makes up what Microsoft calls its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. Those overarching segments generated $14.6 billion and $13.4 billion in revenue, respectively, in the company’s fiscal Q2 2021.

“What we have built is very helpful in times of crisis and there is a big crisis right now,” Nadella said. “But you need to sort of obviously build all of this over a period of years if not decades and then sustain it through not just product innovation, but also I would say, practice every day.”

The announcement follows Microsoft’s involvement in uncovering the breadth of the massive SolarWinds cyber attack in December, which hit private companies like cybersecurity firm FireEye (FEYE) and government agencies including the Treasury, Commerce, and State Departments, as well as the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.

Microsoft itself was also hacked, though no customer data was breached. A Reuters report indicated that, as part of the hack of the National Telecommunications and Information Agency, Microsoft’s Office 365 software was attacked, allowing the intruders to monitor agency emails for months. Microsoft, however, said at the time that it has identified no vulnerabilities in its cloud or Office software.

Though hit by the attack, Microsoft also worked with the government and customers to help determine the scale of the hack.

“I was most proud that we became the first responders for this attack,” Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft corporate vice president of security, compliance, and identity marketing, told Yahoo Finance.

“We were the defenders that other defenders were turning to. We were working with FireEye and across the public sector and private sector coming together saying ‘What should we do, and how should we protect our world against it?’ ” she said. The U.S. Treasury Department was one of the victims of the SolarWinds hack. (Image: Xinhua/ via Getty Images)

Part of Microsoft’s ability to respond to the hack has to do with what’s called “zero trust” architecture, Nadella explained. Essentially that means a company’s cybersecurity capabilities always function as though there has been a breach of some kind. It’s a defense against being left flatfooted when a new hack comes along that you’re not able to protect against.

“One of the things about Microsoft’s investment is really not just about the security investment — which is substantial when you look at Defender or Sentinel or Azure Active Directory and the list goes on — but it is that ability to take all of our investments in AI and data and infrastructure and bring it to bear for security,” Nadella said. “And that I think is what makes us pretty unique.”

Working from home adds to companies’ security needs

The SolarWinds hack came as the coronavirus pandemic spurred many companies to allow their employees to work from home, which introduced a new attack vector for hackers. When you’re working from your office, you’re, hopefully, hooked into a secured connection that can monitor for things like malware or other strange network activity.

At home, though, you’re running on your own network, adding a wrinkle to your employer’s ability to protect itself. It wouldn’t take much for you to download malware on your computer at home, then accidentally send that software to your company’s systems when you connect to its network to update a spreadsheet or upload a report.

“Security has to be built in at every single point,” Jakkal said. “It cannot be an afterthought,”

Microsoft says it currently protects more than 400,000 customers across 120 countries, including 90 Fortune 100 companies. The tech giant breaks its security offerings down into four categories: security, compliance, identity, and management.

Part of that includes providing security not just for Microsoft-powered devices, but those running Apple’s (AAPL) iOS and macOS and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android, as well as products running on competing cloud platforms like Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Google’s Google Cloud Platform.

“There needs to be a real different approach to creating a cybersecurity solution for customers,” Nadella said.

“In what is an interconnected world it's not about any one point solution, it is about having, I would say, an architectural approach, which then needs to be reinforced every day.”

As cloud services continue to expand, and Microsoft’s stake in the industry grows alongside it, protecting the customers who use those services will prove ever more important.

“It is not just transformation in order for you to remain in business. You need to have that digital control plane, not just for your workers so that they can log on to their PCs from home and be on Teams calls,” Nadella said.

“Your manufacturing plant needs to continue where the engineers, the operational data all need to be reasoned over. That is the transformation that I think we are seeing the acceleration of.”

Of course, hackers and cybercriminals will continue to hit at businesses regardless of what company they have protecting them. But with the continued growth in cloud computing and an expanded work-from-home environment, Microsoft stands to benefit as a player in the cybersecurity industry.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: At some point you applied to Harvard, though, and got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, what was the case was this. When I won the award in my very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, [INAUDIBLE].

So he had been an alumni of Harvard. And so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he got into the almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time. So I was supported through the whole application process. And was really an amazing experience.

But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this [INAUDIBLE]. So it brought in like a new dynamic in the competition, because for the first time what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing.

And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them. So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a wait on this.

And actually what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. So at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret it. I just think that there was a different path to take.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/kenyan-tech-entrepreneur-explains-why-144921570.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0P00012B2W.TO', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'CSCO.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'NFLX.US', 'ORCL.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SPXL.US', 'TQQQ.US']",['HARVARD'],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.191}"

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: It's often said that life is about the journey, not the destination. Well, Mubarak Muyika's path to success is like none you've ever heard. Growing up in Kenya's middle class and orphaned at a young age, opportunities in a tech industry were limited. But as Mubarak tells it, he refused to be a victim. Driven by his competitive spirit and win at all cost attitude, Mubarak first revealed his knack for technology by taking the top spot in not one, but two, nationwide science fairs and went on to launch a web services business at the age of 17.

Now at 26 years old, Mubarak is in Silicon Valley with a new company and a dream to bring big tech to Africa's small businesses. In this episode of Influencers, I'm joined by Mubarak Muyika, founder and president of Zagace, as we discuss his entrepreneurial journey, why he turned down a scholarship from Harvard, and what he admires about billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.

[INTERLUDE MUSIC]

- Hello and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace, an enterprise software company, and Mubarak joins us from Nairobi. Mubarak, nice to see you.

- Thank you very much for having me here.

- So I want to ask you about your company, and it's fascinating, and you've got an incredible story. First of all, why don't you tell us about what Zagace does.

- Zagace is an enterprise management platform that seeks to make enterprise software basic and accessible to all with a focus for small businesses. That's basically what Zagace does, and that's what it is.

ANDY SERWER: And who do you compete with? And who are your customers? And how does that all work?

Story continues

MUBARAK MUYIKA: We compete with a number of customers that are described as point tools. So the first point tool that we consider a competitor is Quickbooks, Quickbooks and TurboTax. These are primary competitors, but they don't address the direct line of business that we're in because we have a suit of products that focus on making a full experience for small businesses, but TurboTax and Quickbooks tend to focus more on accounting and the taxation piece.

So we tend to address a wide range of business, small business needs. So you find that small customers tend to use a variety of tools. They could use Excel at one point, you could use a different subscription, so when you tend to look at the experience of a small business, it's more like-- it's just a chaotic alternative to Zagace. They are-- they have all these subscriptions they have to use.

- And are your customers in Africa? Are they all over the world?

- We have customers in over 60 countries. Our primary and largest customer market is in Africa, but then over time, the business-- the business needs and the business pardons are almost the same in different parts of the world. So it's enabled us to acquire customers from different parts of the world.

- I want to talk about your story, as I mentioned. It's a pretty incredible one, but you had personal tragedy. You were orphaned at a young age, and then started a business when you were 17. Can you talk about your upbringing first for us?

- OK, so I grew up-- I grew up in a household that was pretty middle-class from a Kenyan standard. At the time, that's in the 90s, being born in the 90s. My dad being a civil servant. So it was a pretty middle-class standard type of lifestyle. And then when my dad passed on, there used to be a number of circumstances that we started to experience that's from we were having issues keeping up with our active lifestyle, our beating on beetles, living a single mother, so it was really a challenge. So in all that period, it was an environment that was super competitive because we used to have multiple relatives and multiple friends that we didn't have. Suddenly, we couldn't keep up. So it used to feel like it was really a big deal to keep up.

So in that whole process, at a later time a couple of years later, I lost my mom, too. So when I lost my mom, it became a point where it required that I personally start to take care my younger brother and start to be like, I thought a thing, and make sure that all problems that we have are solved, not more than just it, but they needed kind of solutions. So in that whole process where multiple relatives supported, and then in the whole process of supporting, I had grown up being a competitive person. That's from my childhood. I like video games. I've always wanted to win. So it was always a thing of mine.

So in that whole process, I figure that, me, I'm not going to be a victim of any of this kind of stuff. So my only thing is that what's my play? And how I'm going to win. So that's what I became my focus. So when I got into high school, the very first thing that really changed my perspective in high school was the fact that I actually never got into a high school that I really wanted to because I kind of felt like, it wasn't the really best, but it was really good. And so it made me feel like I got beat at some point, something that I'm not used to. You know, I've gotten used to winning, getting what I want.

So when you fail to get that at some point, it makes you feel like you need to compete even better. So when that began to happen in high school, we had this situation or school arrangement where there were science fairs that you could participate in, and compete in schools all over the country. So it had multiple stages. So you'd have to come up with, a project convince people to with you convince multiple people to support it by allocating resources and multiple things.

So from that whole experience I got into it I go to a national level when I was about 17. That was I was actually-- I was actually not 17. I was 16. Then that was just I was the youngest person to get to the national level. It was a completely new experience. For the first time at my age I could see people from different schools. I had a perspective that was a national level. So the whole thing about it was that it became a new reality that I had to embrace.

So with that, the following year now, I became the best, and when I became the best at national level, I had known a couple of people so many times. So the thing was now, what's the next thing? The next thing was now how do I look at it from an international level? So you know that in high school, I won two awards at the national level. And that's the science fairs, although I had multiple projects, all of them at the national level. But the two of them that I won was more of a perspective of things that were my interests, things that I liked, and things that I really believed were the best.

And so with that, it changed my game from an aspect of persons that I interacted with because the largest companies in Kenya were the ones supporting the events. So it felt like a really new experience. So with that, a whole new angle came in. Some of the participants that were in older theme, I'd really defeated them, and then there was this aspect of an African competition called the Anzisha prize. So it used to be it was more like I'd been beaten at a point or something that I didn't know about. So I entered it the following year, and I actually won an award for the work that I was doing with a company called Hype Century.

So Hype Century was a company that I started when I was in my final year in high school. The specific thing about it was it came as a result of my initial innovation, which was creation of a database to track multiple tracking tracks for oil tankers, and for just purposes of management office of management of a business. So with all that I used to get requests from clients to build websites, and then in that whole process of building websites, the clients was starting to stock up. And when they started to build so many, what used to be the case I got-- I decided to structure our business in which companies could pay subscriptions.

- And then, let me just jump in here, so at some point, you applied to Harvard though,

- Right.

- And then got a scholarship but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

- What was the case was this: when I won the award in my-- the very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level? Which was the advice of multiple partners and teachers and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting that the whole event, Chris Kerubi. So he had been an alumni of Harvard, and so it felt like the next best thing to do-- considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he'd got into almost the highest level from a business perspective --so I applied to Harvard, and it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time.

So I was supported through the whole application process, and it was really an amazing experience. But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had set some of my peers, had actually won an award which was this Anzisha. So it brought in a new dynamic in the competition because for the first time, what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing, and that would take me five years behind for me to actually catch up with them.

So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this, I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide I can put a wait on this, and actually, what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first, then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

- Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

- I actually-- I never thought about it like that because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs because the problem at the time was I used to-- every time I look at multiple people and peers I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me? So that whole thing used to be like that, so and at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret, I just think that there was a different path to take.

- Right. And you made your way to Silicon Valley eventually. Talk to us about that.

- Yeah, so the very first thing was, you know, with this whole experience about raising money, reality started to set in from a business perspective. So the ecosystem in Kenya and Africa is pretty much very small, and the equals really small at the time. So from a fundraising perspective, we were looking at a situation where I already had close to 1,000 business customers in Nairobi from a perspective of 2013-2014.

That was really huge because if you have really huge corporate customers, any expansion in business would mean extending into a business line that's outside of my scope of excellence, or my scope of expertise. So it got to a point where the only most relevant place where it would be practical to expand to and move to, would be the Bay area because of the time, I had multiple contacts I had interacted with from investors to customers to different mentors who were helping out, and they had multiple people that had been supported to move to the Bay Area to raise funding, get customers, so it became a thing that was the next best thing to do when you reach a certain customer point. So it is at that point that it became obvious and necessary that moving into the Bay Area is the next most practical thing.

So what I decided to do, I decided that this is an important and crucial thing. So I made a business decision to decide to expand to the Bay Area. That was like having the company registered, getting an office, and moving to the Bay Area to start initially with a focus to get investors. But then when I got to the Bay Area, the thing of the time was I didn't think that it would turn out the way it did because I think the experience was so blissful because 1, at the time, there was this thing that Obama was a Kenyan.

So when I got to the Bay Area, being a Kenyan was just like the coolest thing I'd ever experienced in my life. I was treated so well. I was invited to so many places. I used to get so many messages and so many emails that it took me to close to two years to actually read them because at the time, the experience was just exciting. That whole process, I figure that there's actually a possibility of value and expansion in terms of business from things like joint ventures, from things like partnerships, where products can actually-- products from Africa can actually be sold to different customers bundled together and that whole that whole thing.

So in that whole process, I figured out a way in which we can structure a corporation. That's good advice from multiple mentors and multiple partners who are helping out, and that's pretty much how I ended up in the Bay Area. Then ever since, it's been more like-- it's been more like a thing that's been really good because it's really helped the business development around the world because that single thing has given Zagace the ability to acquire customers in multiple places around the world with so much ease, and the level of sophistication also changed significantly because the amount of data that we were working with in Nairobi as a Nairobi company, is really different from what we do now as a multinational company. And then the operations--

- And you mentioned how it was advantageous to be from Africa when Barack Obama was president, had things gotten more difficult when Donald Trump was president? Because, of course, he notoriously denigrated African countries.

- I'd say that Trump is more of a businessman than Obama, so the thing is what happens is that at the time, people didn't meet me like a businessman. People met me as a Kenyan. So during Trump's time, I did both. I had grown up so my interactions with people are more business, terms, agreements. So I'd say that it didn't affect much, it was just at a different time, and not grown up.

- Right, OK. So Zagace found a market in the trend of African companies going online. Where does that trend stand now? And has COVID-19 accelerated that?

- Big time, big time. As of today, we are doing close to 10 million sign-ups-- businesses that we've acquired through multiple product stocks from businesses that have signed up online from resellers or partnerships. With all that, we've gotten approximately two million customers. So this whole process is-- 70% of the customers come from Africa, and it's largely driven by COVID-19.

And then the other thing about it is that what's really driving growth in Africa isn't really COVID-19, it's about big tech politics in the Bay Area, because you realize that the technical system in Africa isn't controlled in Africa. If you want to expand a business in Africa, it doesn't make sense to really invest in Africa. You invest in the Bay Area, because that's where the talent that's where is the big tech. And so it's more of we are at the point where the next billion customers for the big tech, the big five, are going to come from Africa. We are talking about a population that's going to be joining the internet as users or becoming banked users. That's from an aspect of fintech.

Persons who have no-- persons who have no access to banking facilities or have no access to internet, and it also presents a direct opportunity considering the countries are so many, and it's so different. So regulation is easy to go around as compared to a country like India, which offers the same opportunity for big tech in the Bay Area. So the thing about it becomes that the only way we can live with the trend in Africa, to become a big tech company in Africa, we have to be like the big five in the Bay Area, and they're like, we are, we follow them, so we're just like a bear on their back.

- Let me-- I want to get back to Zagace in a minute though, but I want to ask you about COVID in Kenya and in East Africa generally? What is the situation like there right now?

- The situation-- I think the situation is really-- could be really bad, but the problem is that 1, the economy is really bad. And then the process of tracking it is really slow. So we cannot get an accurate picture in the short term. So right now the information is foggy and hazy, but what I'd say the situation could be really bad because what's on the ground and what's reported takes time before you can actually match the two.

- Right. So getting back to your company, how big is it right now, Mubarak, in terms of revenue? And what are the key ingredients for growth?

- I think from an aspect of last year, we did around $2 million in revenue. And the key aspects of growth are we're talking about users, APIs, those are just the main things that are driving growth in the short term. And here we're talking about users, we talk about small businesses, and individual solopreneurs.

- Right, and how fast is the company growing right now? How do you measure that?

- I'd say during-- since COVID started, we've done close to 5 million sign-ups, businesses that we would never had access to that we do have access to right now from the multiple product stocks.

- Right. Do you think there is room for a company like you in enterprise software with all the big giants like Salesforce and Oracle?

- Big time. There is so much room for us because you see the biggest problem about small businesses is usually around customer lifetime cycles and the support cost. So our innovation isn't really enterprise software. Our innovation is the distribution. What we've innovated is the distribution. So the main reason why we built Zagace is more of to make enterprise software basic and accessible to all. So the enterprise software already existed, and it will continue to exist, but is it an Oracle thing to make it basic and accessible to all? Definitely not, and that's not their business.

So and then the other thing is that the economics around getting small business owners and solopreneurs are completely different from enterprise customers because from the time they begin to pay from the amount of data that it requires to collect for them to actually find value in those products, so there is room for us. Big time.

- You talked about how you were accepted when you went to Silicon Valley because you're from Kenya, but on the other hand, have you faced any issues of discrimination or being limited in terms of the capital that you like to get because you're a person of color?

- I'd say how I'd look at it is more I felt that, but I haven't felt-- I haven't experienced it directly because I've been fortunate because at the time that most of the people that I got to interact with were persons that looked at me as a person of industry, as a professional in the industry. So it wasn't more of a startup thing, and in as much as the discrimination exists, I didn't experience it because of a controlled network and a controlled group of people that were helping me out. So, yes, it's there, from an aspect of larger rounds, but then I haven't had first-hand customer experience where someone has directly done it to me as a person individually.

- Do you see other people in your shoes in Kenya and maybe beyond in Africa who need financing who can't get it? Or do they have access to capital?

- I think it's a really big problem in Africa, but there you see in terms of corporate, if your structure matches as a corporate, there are many ways to go around some of those things, because I think about it like this: if I have $50 billion that I am to give to somebody in the Bay Area and to give to someone in Nairobi, I definitely have a preference for someone that I know in an environment that I know. So if you look at it from that perspective, I think it isn't more about discrimination, it's about how to structure it because it's more about just going for it.

People tend to work with people that they feel comfortable around and people that they feel comfortable with. So I look at it from that perspective, as a as opposed to an aspect of discrimination because the issue is usually yes, you can say this discrimination, but is there really value or too much of the need for that money? Because the problem becomes in as much as there are so many people who don't have funding, there are also not very good innovative stuff that need accurate a money. Most of it is just stuff that can't pass the statistical, [INAUDIBLE] viable to meet those investment needs. So if you look at it from that perspective, any business or innovation that is financially viable and sustainable over time can have access to funding with proper corporate structuring that can still be [INAUDIBLE] discrimination problems.

- What tech companies are-- American tech companies --have large market shares in Nairobi? In other words, is it Apple? Is it Facebook? Is it Twitter? Do people use Skype? What are the tech products and services that Kenyans use?

- We're talking like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and yeah, I think WhatsApp. So pretty much those are the main ones from an aspect of the largest number of customer ba-- actually Facebook is more of a pointer, in terms of how we grow in the business because of their style of business operation.

- And I want to ask you about microfinance because that's a popular way for Western entrepreneurs to support businesses in developing countries. Do you see that in Kenya much? And what do you think about that?

- Microfinance is a really reliable thing because it creates a personal relationship between the financing and the persons involved, but then the thing about it is that it may be good for small scale, but the impact-- the impact is only from an aspect of getting out of poverty but not big business growth. It's the one for small businesses and individuals from a poverty perspective, and it's really sustainable, but when it comes to big business, I think it's a really unsustainable model because it creates politics in big business and then brings in unnecessary bureaucracy from an aspect of big business operation.

- Mubarak, you mentioned that the economy is not very good in Kenya. Why is that?

- I think it's because of one-- there's a discrepancy between information that we acquired from debt and corruption matter, so what usually happens is that the stories that we read today are information that will take more like three months for you to actually get a clearer picture of what's going on, and that's from an aspect of government information and independently collaborated information because we have constant information being disputed over time.

So the only way you can have information that's constantly reliable is that it takes like three months or something like that. So the economy-- the economy's really bad because of one the debt thing, and then the COVID situation, and then you add to that the corruption, so when you bring in the corruption in the equation, information exchange gets hazy because we cannot tell what up to a certain point when it's undisputable, or indisputable.

- Do you live full time in Nairobi? Or do you split time between Nairobi and Silicon Valley? Where do you-- where do you live most of the time?

- I actually moved full time to Silicon Valley. I only-- I only come to Nairobi once in a while because it's more of I have family and family ties and things like those, so it's more I moved to the Bay Area fully.

- Who are your role models, Mubarak, in terms of tech CEOs and leaders and maybe people in other fields of endeavor? And for instance, Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Do you-- do you look to them?

- I'd say I look to Bill Gates quite a bit from an aspect of competitiveness and from an aspect of focus because he has this ability to look at things and look at them to a level until he gets what he wants. But I think what I borrow mostly-- who I borrow mostly from is Warren Buffett because I think Warren Buffett represents-- he represents a mature American business person that is so neatly organized and thorough and to the point.

- Have you ever met Warren Buffett or been to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting?

- No, but I will one day.

- And what about the rest of your career in your life, Mubarak? You're only 26 years old. What are your aspirations? What do you hope to achieve over the next decade and throughout your lifetime?

- No, I think the most important thing is to figure out a way in which I can make enterprise software basic and accessible to all. That's around the world, just not in Africa. Thanks to statistics and newly acquired information that informs insight on multiple things. So I think for the foreseeable decade, that I think is what I really want to achieve because what we've been able to do is make enterprise software standard, which was something that was really not possible in the past.

- And last question, Mubarak. If you could ask Warren Buffett one question, what would it be?

- I'd say investment, but then yeah, I'd say investments.

- You'd ask him about investment?

- Right. Not actually investment. I'd actually ask him to invest with me.

- Oh, you would ask him to invest. Right. Good one. Love it. All right we're going to have to leave it there. Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace. Thank you so much for joining us, Mubarak.

- Thank you.

195,2021-01-27T02:21:36+00:00,"LG Display reports stronger profit on iPhone demand, rising panel prices","By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd reported its highest quarterly profit in over three years on Wednesday, with help from increased shipments of Apple Inc's new iPhones.

The Apple supplier posted an operating profit of 685 billion won ($622 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of 422 billion won in the same period a year earlier.

It was the display panel firm's highest quarterly profit since the second quarter of 2017, and soundly ahead of market expectations for a 286 billion won profit, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate derived from 12 analyst estimates.

""As the global work-from-home situation continued in the fourth quarter, demand for TV and IT products remained strong,"" LG Display said in a statement.

Shipments and prices of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels rose for both TVs and smartphones, while the strong earnings were helped by full-scale production at its Guangzhou OLED plant, the company said.

Analysts highlighted increased shipments of OLED panels for Apple Inc's new iPhone 12 and higher prices for liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. LCD prices rose on the back of growing demand for TVs from global consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apple's iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter were likely up 21% on-year due to the strong performance of the iPhone 12, according to Counterpoint data.

Stronger iPhone sales should spill over into LG Display's first quarter result, analysts said.

""The first half of the year is usually a seasonal down-cycle, but this year is different. It will continue to swing to profit, as iPhone 12 sales are expected to increase panel shipments by 1.5 to two times the amount a year earlier,"" said Kim Kwang-jin, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.

LCD panel prices should also remain high in the first quarter, he said.

LG Display, which had previously said it planed to halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by 2020, said in an earnings call on Wednesday that it will be flexible on domestic production based on market conditions this year.

A power outage in Nippon Electric Glass' (NEG) Japan-based glass manufacturing facility in December may affect LG Display's first-quarter shipments, as about 80% of its glass came from NEG in the first half of 2020, analysts said.

But the lower supply of large-sized glass could further lift panel prices in the first quarter, offsetting the impact of any fall in shipments, they added.

Revenue rose 16% to 7.5 trillion won, LG Display said in a regulatory filing.

Its shares fell 5% on Wednesday compared with a 0.6% drop in the wider market, which analysts put down to profit-taking. The stock has still gained some 63% since the start of November.

($1 = 1,101.0000 won)

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: I'd love to begin by talking a bit about the work you've done at Revolution, the Rise of the Rest fund, and this distribution dynamic we've seen play out as a result of COVID, people leaving San Francisco, leaving New York, and if you feel like this is COVID specific or if this is the market coming to the thesis that you've been outlining here for several years.

STEVE CASE: A little bit of both. As you said, we started the Rise of the Rest initiative and Startup America almost a decade ago and said, we need to have a more evenly dispersed innovation economy. We can't just have the successful startups in a few places like Silicon Valley. We need to spread them all around the country. And the data from the venture capital associations over the last few years, about 75% of venture capital has just gone to three states-- California, New York, and Massachusetts.

So we've been on this for a while. And we've long predicted that at some point, there would be a, after a brain drain of talent, people leaving the middle of the country to go the coast because that's where the opportunity was, there'd be a kind of a returning, a boomerang. And we're seeing an acceleration of that because of the pandemic. So maybe that is one of the silver linings.

A lot of people that were in San Francisco, were in New York, some of these major startup cities, did decide to shelter in place. I think initially, they thought they would just do that temporarily. Some of them have decided to stay, whether they be entrepreneurs or venture capitalists. I think that bodes well for the Rise of the Rest.

JULIE HYMAN: How is that distribution going to play out? Because, you know, I'm looking at the map of your footprint of the Rise of the Rest fund and some tour dates that you guys were making. I mean, Miami is on here. That has obviously been a hot destination for people to move to. Nashville has been hot. Dallas has been another place that people have been looking to, Denver. Are we going to get-- are you at all concerned about new kinds of unequal distributions based on the migrations that we're now seeing as a result of the pandemic?

Story continues

STEVE CASE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, right now, if you look at the last couple of decades, in terms of what's happened with the innovation economy in this country, it has overwhelmingly been in three cities. What we're trying to do with the Rise of the Rest is spread that to more, like, 30 cities. And so far, we have visited I guess 44 cities with our Rise of the Rest bus tour. Our Rise of the Rest fund has invested in over 150 companies and 70 cities.

So there's a lot of things happening there. And I think that really is going to be helped and catalyzed by what's happening with this pandemic. So certainly, there are challenges in each of these cities. And it's great to see mayors like the mayor in Miami and other leaders in different cities really saying, this is a moment. Let's seize it. Let's really focus on startups. Just try to be a magnet for the talent. Then we can be a magnet for the capital, and we can have some of the next generation, big, iconic breakthrough companies follow.

We actually just published a week or so ago a new playbook, a Rise of the Rest playbook. You can go to the revolution.com site and click on it. And it's a free guide that really just talks about what's happening in cities like Miami, cities like Tulsa, cities like Denver, and more broadly, in states like Ohio.

There's some amazing things that have been bubbling, really, for a number of years. It's just we're now seeing this acceleration because of the pandemic. And hopefully, that will mean over the next five or 10 years, more of the venture capital will spread out. More of the startups will spread out. And therefore, more of the job creation will spread out.

MYLES UDLAND: And, you know, Steve, related to that, you hear a lot from VCs, who will say things like, you know, a city needs a big exit to kind of be codified as a major place that you want to put a lot of capital. And what we're seeing in public markets today is the SPAC is now so popular, such an easier route for companies to come public. Do you think that will help take a city like Columbus to its first deck of corn exit, right? If that's something that that kind of a hub needs to have more folks like yourself say, hey, I want to look specifically at a hub like that to put a lot of capital to work.

STEVE CASE: Well, some of it, I think, for venture capital just expanding the aperture. There actually have been some breakout multibillion dollar successes in Indianapolis, in Columbus, in Denver, in Provo, Utah. But this has already been happening. We're just now seeing an acceleration. And that's what I think is going to be interesting to watch over the next decade.

I think SPACs do create a great option for companies that have a long-term growth plan, that they really need to tell that story and show how they're going to grow. And the SPACs do seem to be better pricing those growth stories in more of a traditional IPO, where you're more constrained in terms of what you can disclose.

More options for entrepreneurs, more options for companies, more capital going to startups in general is a good thing, which is why I worked on the JOBS Act seven or eight years ago to change some of the rules regarding capital formation. And there's still work to be done. So any innovations such as SPACs I think can be helpful.

BRIAN SOZZI: Steve, you also helped develop Section 230 way back when. Looking at the debate that has evolved since, how would you modernize it?

STEVE CASE: It's a good question. When I was running AOL now almost, I guess, 30 years ago, that was when some of the initial rules of the road of the internet, whether it be e-commerce, whether it should be taxes or how do you keep things safe for kids, but also the 230 rule. At the time, it was different, obviously, because fewer people were on the internet. And even on AOL, it was mostly about posting messages and message boards.

The phenomenon in the last decade in particular, with things like Facebook and the news feed, where there's algorithms that are kind of putting things higher up in the list, that does change some of the dynamics. So I do think it requires a fresh look. Obviously, there's a lot of focus here in Washington now on that. Exactly how it should change, I haven't focused on it enough recently to really know.

But it's fair to say that now that the internet has really arrived and the way these systems are working, particularly social media platforms, is different. And they are playing more of a role in terms of what people are seeing. It's not just serendipitous. Taking a fresh look at 230 does make sense.

BRIAN SOZZI: What would that fresh look like, Steve? What would it look like to the bottom line of big tech?

STEVE CASE: Well, it's hard to say. I think it's a sensitive issue. There's a lot of nuance to it. So I think you have to really kind of dig in and understand what sort of the-- you're trying to deal with. How do you solve it in a way that has positive benefits for the broader startup ecosystem? Obviously, some of these big, powerful companies, whether it be Facebook or Google or others, are so strong, it's hard for startups to really compete with them.

So anything that can level the playing field and allow more startups to do things that are more disruptive, including challenging incumbents, not just in legacy industries, but also some of the Silicon Valley giants I think would be a good thing. 230 is only a small part of that discussion, but I think it could be an important part.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, obviously, antitrust and lots of other stuff going to be part of the discussion also. Steve, I do want to switch gears and talk to you about that phenomenon that Myles was talking about at the top of the show that we've been watching closely, which is the heavy short interest in a lot of shares that are now seeing the sort of counter bull raid, for lack of a better term.

And there's also been talk with SPACs, with hot IPOs, with certain stocks that have just been going to the moon, and a lot of parallels being drawn to 1999, a period that you are very familiar with. And so, I'm curious, do you think we are at another one of those moments, which are always hard to call? But what are you seeing in here that maybe gives you pause in this market or not?

STEVE CASE: Well, I think it is a little different. The 1999 obviously was the internet was just coming of age. It was sort of this phenomenon. Any company with dot com in their name, people were interested in investing in. Many companies went public that really had little or no revenue, and in some cases, didn't even know what their business model was going to be. So it really was really a pure concept dynamic.

That's not what we're seeing today with IPOs or even with SPACs. There's much more granularity in terms of the growth trajectories of these businesses. We've involved-- you know, Revolution Growth, which is sort of the flagship fund at Revolution, has been involved last year. DraftKings went public quite successfully via SPAC. Now it's trading at a $20 billion plus valuation. More recently, a couple of weeks ago, we announced the transaction. Still have a couple of months before we'll close with Talkspace and the telehealth base also via SPAC.

So we do think it's a useful mechanism for companies that need access to capital and want to tell their story with more transparency that they're able to do on the IPO side. Is the market fully valued? Time will tell. There are some stocks that maybe are a little high, but there are also a lot of stocks that have missed because a lot of the momentum has been for those giants, the so-called FAANG stocks.

We also need to focus not just on the companies that exist today that are going public or are public, but this next generation of companies, which is why backing startups everywhere, going back to the discussion about the Rise of the Rest, is really, really so important.

JULIE HYMAN: And so, let's talk about that for a moment, the private market. Are you finding good value on that side? Are you finding ample opportunity? Are you finding it at prices that you think are attractive right now?

STEVE CASE: Well, we're careful. We have three funds at Revolution that, you know, as I said, Revolution Growth is the main one. About 2/3 of our assets under management. We also have Revolution Ventures, which has been quite significant. It had a lot of momentum. And then, more recently, this Rise of the Rest in seed fund.

We're being careful, particularly on the later stage growth investments. We're being pretty disciplined. We make three or four investments typically in a year. Some make 15 or 20. And some of that is because we want to make sure we're really backing the right entrepreneurs and have the time to help them scale those companies. But also, in some cases, we have thought valuations were on the high side. So we've been careful in terms of pulling the trigger, if you will, on making new commitments.

MYLES UDLAND: And, you know, Steve, just to wrap up, finally, we started the conversation with kind of how COVID changed the geographic distribution perhaps of where people are looking. I'm curious if there's new areas of the market, particularly in healthcare, that folks are more interested in, given the way that, you know, the pandemic certainly confronted us with a lot of shortcomings within that part of the system. And Talkspace, we talked to them a couple of weeks ago-- certainly a part of that. But I'm curious if there's other opportunities there that you guys are seeing.

STEVE CASE: Absolutely. We also have another company-- Revolution Growth-backed Tempus in Chicago has done some amazing things using big data to try to better diagnose initially cancer, but they also focused on COVID. CLEAR, a company we also backed at Revolution Growth, initially focused on kind of an airport fast pass, but also launched in this past year a health pass. Actually powered the bubble that the Hockey League used and NHL used in Canada a few months ago, and now expanding that with a lot of corporations embracing the health pass.

So I do think-- because I think the pandemic was a reminder how important health is in terms of everyday life and how some of the delivery systems aren't very effective. So creating better care, better outcomes, more affordability, kind of a greater convenience, I think people are on it. And there will be a lot of momentum in that sector over the next decade. We're already seeing it. We expect that to accelerate.

Also, by the way, it ties in with the Rise of the Rest because some of the most important healthcare organizations, like M.D. Anderson in Texas or Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio or the big health plans like United in Minneapolis, a lot of health plans in Nashville. I think as healthcare becomes more important, and we're entering this third wave of the internet, these rising cities will become more important as well. So that's why I'm so optimistic about the future.

BRIAN SOZZI: Steve, we've got some new data out this morning. Definitely, I want to get your thoughts on it. From the Americans for Tax Fairness, they came out and noted that the wealth of America's billionaires increased $1.1 trillion through the first 10 months of the pandemic, which really seems out of whack. It really does. What would you like to see from the body administration to close that wealth gap between the haves and have-nots?

STEVE CASE: Now I've been very concerned about this and talked about it over the years. And some of that ties in with the work we're doing, trying to back startups to do create jobs and good-paying jobs, not just in those companies, but for every startup job, there are about five other jobs in the community in housing and services and so forth.

And in terms of your specific question, when he was running for office last summer, now President Biden put this Build Back Better plan in place that did deal with income inequality and also did deal with this issue of, how do you make sure we don't have the innovation haves and have-nots, where some people, but not that many, are really benefiting from this innovation economy? A lot of people are being left behind by it. And that included trying to get more capital to more entrepreneurs in more cities, to back more startups and create more jobs, as well as, more recently, the legislation they introduced, which included a $15 minimum wage.

So I think the Biden administration's on it. They recognize that we continue to be the leader of the pack, the most innovative entrepreneurial nation in the world. But it hasn't been particularly inclusive. And we need to have a kind of reboot capitalism and reboot innovation and entrepreneurship so it brings everybody along. Everybody gets the benefits, and everybody has an opportunity to participate in the innovation economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/steve-case-innovation-economy-2021-170436051.html?.tsrc=rss,"['300206.SHE', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'DKNG.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'TWTR.US', 'XLK.US']",['INNOVATION ECONOMY'],"{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.131}"

When I was running AOL now almost, I guess, 30 years ago, that was when some of the initial rules of the road of the internet, whether it be e-commerce, whether it should be taxes or how do you keep things safe for kids, but also the 230 rule. At the time, it was different, obviously, because fewer people were on the internet. And even on AOL, it was mostly about posting messages and message boards.

The phenomenon in the last decade in particular, with things like Facebook and the news feed, where there's algorithms that are kind of putting things higher up in the list, that does change some of the dynamics. So I do think it requires a fresh look. Obviously, there's a lot of focus here in Washington now on that. Exactly how it should change, I haven't focused on it enough recently to really know.

But it's fair to say that now that the internet has really arrived and the way these systems are working, particularly social media platforms, is different. And they are playing more of a role in terms of what people are seeing. It's not just serendipitous. Taking a fresh look at 230 does make sense.

BRIAN SOZZI: What would that fresh look like, Steve? What would it look like to the bottom line of big tech?

STEVE CASE: Well, it's hard to say. I think it's a sensitive issue. There's a lot of nuance to it. So I think you have to really kind of dig in and understand what sort of the-- you're trying to deal with. How do you solve it in a way that has positive benefits for the broader startup ecosystem? Obviously, some of these big, powerful companies, whether it be Facebook or Google or others, are so strong, it's hard for startups to really compete with them.

So anything that can level the playing field and allow more startups to do things that are more disruptive, including challenging incumbents, not just in legacy industries, but also some of the Silicon Valley giants I think would be a good thing. 230 is only a small part of that discussion, but I think it could be an important part.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, obviously, antitrust and lots of other stuff going to be part of the discussion also. Steve, I do want to switch gears and talk to you about that phenomenon that Myles was talking about at the top of the show that we've been watching closely, which is the heavy short interest in a lot of shares that are now seeing the sort of counter bull raid, for lack of a better term.

And there's also been talk with SPACs, with hot IPOs, with certain stocks that have just been going to the moon, and a lot of parallels being drawn to 1999, a period that you are very familiar with. And so, I'm curious, do you think we are at another one of those moments, which are always hard to call? But what are you seeing in here that maybe gives you pause in this market or not?

STEVE CASE: Well, I think it is a little different. The 1999 obviously was the internet was just coming of age. It was sort of this phenomenon. Any company with dot com in their name, people were interested in investing in. Many companies went public that really had little or no revenue, and in some cases, didn't even know what their business model was going to be. So it really was really a pure concept dynamic.

That's not what we're seeing today with IPOs or even with SPACs. There's much more granularity in terms of the growth trajectories of these businesses. We've involved-- you know, Revolution Growth, which is sort of the flagship fund at Revolution, has been involved last year. DraftKings went public quite successfully via SPAC. Now it's trading at a $20 billion plus valuation. More recently, a couple of weeks ago, we announced the transaction. Still have a couple of months before we'll close with Talkspace and the telehealth base also via SPAC.

So we do think it's a useful mechanism for companies that need access to capital and want to tell their story with more transparency that they're able to do on the IPO side. Is the market fully valued? Time will tell. There are some stocks that maybe are a little high, but there are also a lot of stocks that have missed because a lot of the momentum has been for those giants, the so-called FAANG stocks.

We also need to focus not just on the companies that exist today that are going public or are public, but this next generation of companies, which is why backing startups everywhere, going back to the discussion about the Rise of the Rest, is really, really so important.

JULIE HYMAN: And so, let's talk about that for a moment, the private market. Are you finding good value on that side? Are you finding ample opportunity? Are you finding it at prices that you think are attractive right now?

STEVE CASE: Well, we're careful. We have three funds at Revolution that, you know, as I said, Revolution Growth is the main one. About 2/3 of our assets under management. We also have Revolution Ventures, which has been quite significant. It had a lot of momentum. And then, more recently, this Rise of the Rest in seed fund.

We're being careful, particularly on the later stage growth investments. We're being pretty disciplined. We make three or four investments typically in a year. Some make 15 or 20. And some of that is because we want to make sure we're really backing the right entrepreneurs and have the time to help them scale those companies. But also, in some cases, we have thought valuations were on the high side. So we've been careful in terms of pulling the trigger, if you will, on making new commitments.

MYLES UDLAND: And, you know, Steve, just to wrap up, finally, we started the conversation with kind of how COVID changed the geographic distribution perhaps of where people are looking. I'm curious if there's new areas of the market, particularly in healthcare, that folks are more interested in, given the way that, you know, the pandemic certainly confronted us with a lot of shortcomings within that part of the system. And Talkspace, we talked to them a couple of weeks ago-- certainly a part of that. But I'm curious if there's other opportunities there that you guys are seeing.

STEVE CASE: Absolutely. We also have another company-- Revolution Growth-backed Tempus in Chicago has done some amazing things using big data to try to better diagnose initially cancer, but they also focused on COVID. CLEAR, a company we also backed at Revolution Growth, initially focused on kind of an airport fast pass, but also launched in this past year a health pass. Actually powered the bubble that the Hockey League used and NHL used in Canada a few months ago, and now expanding that with a lot of corporations embracing the health pass.

So I do think-- because I think the pandemic was a reminder how important health is in terms of everyday life and how some of the delivery systems aren't very effective. So creating better care, better outcomes, more affordability, kind of a greater convenience, I think people are on it. And there will be a lot of momentum in that sector over the next decade. We're already seeing it. We expect that to accelerate.

Also, by the way, it ties in with the Rise of the Rest because some of the most important healthcare organizations, like M.D. Anderson in Texas or Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio or the big health plans like United in Minneapolis, a lot of health plans in Nashville. I think as healthcare becomes more important, and we're entering this third wave of the internet, these rising cities will become more important as well. So that's why I'm so optimistic about the future.

BRIAN SOZZI: Steve, we've got some new data out this morning. Definitely, I want to get your thoughts on it. From the Americans for Tax Fairness, they came out and noted that the wealth of America's billionaires increased $1.1 trillion through the first 10 months of the pandemic, which really seems out of whack. It really does. What would you like to see from the body administration to close that wealth gap between the haves and have-nots?

STEVE CASE: Now I've been very concerned about this and talked about it over the years. And some of that ties in with the work we're doing, trying to back startups to do create jobs and good-paying jobs, not just in those companies, but for every startup job, there are about five other jobs in the community in housing and services and so forth.

And in terms of your specific question, when he was running for office last summer, now President Biden put this Build Back Better plan in place that did deal with income inequality and also did deal with this issue of, how do you make sure we don't have the innovation haves and have-nots, where some people, but not that many, are really benefiting from this innovation economy? A lot of people are being left behind by it. And that included trying to get more capital to more entrepreneurs in more cities, to back more startups and create more jobs, as well as, more recently, the legislation they introduced, which included a $15 minimum wage.

So I think the Biden administration's on it. They recognize that we continue to be the leader of the pack, the most innovative entrepreneurial nation in the world. But it hasn't been particularly inclusive. And we need to have a kind of reboot capitalism and reboot innovation and entrepreneurship so it brings everybody along. Everybody gets the benefits, and everybody has an opportunity to participate in the innovation economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/steve-case-innovation-economy-2021-170436051.html,"['300206.SHE', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'DKNG.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'TWTR.US', 'XLK.US']",['INNOVATION ECONOMY'],"{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.131}"
198,2021-01-26T12:56:47+00:00,College Dropout Becomes Billionaire With Chinese Gaming Platform,"(Bloomberg) --

When China’s two big mobile powers clashed publicly on New Year’s Eve, the stock of a little-known gaming company surged the most ever, minting a new billionaire in 38-year-old maverick entrepreneur Huang Yimeng.

Shares in his indie game distributor XD Inc. rose 24% on the first trading day of 2021 after Huawei Technologies Co. temporarily removed all Tencent Holdings Ltd. games from its app store in a dispute over their revenue split. Investors flocked to the ByteDance Ltd.-backed creator of TapTap -- a Steam-like download service for games that bypasses the dominant app stores -- on the sign of schism between China’s big two.

The rare incident brought to the fore simmering resentment against the 50% cut that app stores like Huawei’s charge developers and highlighted the key attraction of TapTap: it is ad-supported and thus free to use for both players and publishers.

Now Huang, inspired by Epic Games Inc.’s fight against Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.’s platform fees, hopes to ride that upswell of rebellion and challenge the status quo in the $30 billion Chinese mobile games arena. Already counting blockbuster hits like Genshin Impact on its platform, XD is working to lure more developers disillusioned with the tight grip on game development and distribution enjoyed by Tencent and hardware vendors like Huawei and Xiaomi Corp., which make their app stores the default on every phone they sell.

“More and more creators will come out and say ‘no’ to traditional distribution channels because they don’t need to pay them for selling good content,” the six-foot-one XD co-founder and chief executive officer said in an interview. “The danger of companies using hardware to trap users inside their ecosystems is something we should be looking at from an anti-monopoly standpoint.”

Why Apple’s Fees Have iPhone App-Makers Up in Arms: QuickTake

Huang isn’t all talk. One of 2020’s biggest mobile hits, Pascal’s Wager, picked TapTap as its exclusive Android distribution partner in China. The thematically dark action role-player, created by Giant Network Group Co. unit TipWorks, has sold more than 1.05 million copies globally, according to the studio’s founder Yang Yang. TapTap generated half of those sales and the rest came from the iOS App Store and Google Play, said Yang, who first showcased the game during Apple’s iPhone 11 event in 2019.

Story continues

“The timing was perfect in that our game met with TapTap’s rapid growth,” Yang said. “If someone wants to work with you without even making money, that means they really care about your product. Their way of game publishing is disruptive.”

TapTap’s rise is aided by a growing -- and global -- government and consumer backlash against the handful of mobile giants that control the app economy. It coincides with a Chinese crackdown intended to rein in its most powerful internet corporations from Tencent to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Regulators have yet to address gaming platforms, but the 50% rule set by Chinese Android stores -- which makes Apple and Google’s 30% levies look like a bargain -- is fueling discontent among game studios, big and small.

For months, Tencent had sought a bigger cut of sales through Huawei’s app store in marquee titles like Honor of Kings, but the two companies failed to agree a deal, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. On Dec. 31, Huawei removed Tencent games from its app store only to restore them hours later. Tencent said the next day that the two sides had reached an agreement, without providing details.

Against that backdrop, TapTap users grew 52% in the first half of last year. XD’s stock has risen roughly 470% since listing in Hong Kong at the end of 2019, pushing its market capitalization north of $3.7 billion and the value of Huang’s 35% stake to about $1.3 billion.

XD is one of the few up-and-comers in China’s games industry that hasn’t relied on Tencent’s patronage. It’s attracted powerful backers like ByteDance -- the Tencent nemesis behind TikTok and Douyin that’s developing its own interest in gaming -- as cornerstone investors for its initial public offering. Fellow Shanghai startups Lilith Games and Genshin creator miHoYo are also among its investors, though Huang and his co-founders maintain the controlling stakes and voting rights. That’s helped TapTap become a more neutral platform, where gamers look for both Tencent blockbusters and indie tiles.

The CEO’s path was as unlikely as that of his company. Huang’s first entrepreneurial effort got him kicked out of college.

A former semi-pro basketball player, his first business was a peer-to-peer download network called VeryCD that was quickly overrun with pirated content. In 2003, a sex tape circulating on the network that had been recorded on Huang’s university campus drew the ire of its governors, leading to his dismissal after refusing to remove the clip. He told his school back then that online platforms shouldn’t be responsible for policing content.

“I didn’t regret my decision,” he said. “I’m lucky I left school early so I got more time to work on my website.”

Huang found more success in making web games, enticing fans to splurge on weapons and power-ups for their warriors and sorcerers. As China’s internet use shifted from desktop to mobile, he realized there wasn’t a Steam-style community dedicated to smartphone gamers. TapTap was born in 2016 and has been free to use from the outset.

Outside of China, Fortnite maker Epic Games launched its PC games store in 2018 to challenge Steam by offering a 12% revenue split with developers rather than 30%. XD’s strategy mirrors Epic’s: its in-house games attract users to the store and the store lends more exposure to its games. For now, Huang’s company still generates the bulk of revenue from selling virtual items in games it develops or publishes. Ad sales through TapTap accounted for less than a fifth of XD’s $205 million revenue in the first six months of 2020. Huang expects TapTap to contribute a larger proportion as the platform continues to increase ad slots.

“It’s about time for Huawei and its peers to make changes,” said Chundi Zhang, a gaming analyst with Ampere Analysis. “But if the big guys do cut their fees, it will be TapTap’s turn to be threatened. This is a game of checks and balances.”

The Chinese Internet behemoth lost 6.3% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization below $890 billion. Traders took profit after Monday’s 11% rally, which was Tencent’s biggest in almost a decade. Adding to the caution were comments by an adviser to China’s central bank at a conference, reported by local media, indicating that excessive liquidity was creating asset bubbles.

Thousands of bullish Tencent options lost almost all their value, after some surged as much as 118,300% on Monday. The frenzy in derivatives trading pushed the cost of one-month Tencent options to the highest since March 2014 relative to those tracking the Hong Kong benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The prospect that China will tighten funding conditions threatens to derail Tencent’s stock rally, which has been underpinned by a relentless flow of capital from the mainland. Onshore funds have purchased a record amount of Hong Kong shares this month, with about a quarter of that targeting Tencent. As more than a billion people use its WeChat social-media platform, Tencent is ubiquitous to Chinese investors who have no access to Hong Kong shares of rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. through the trading links.

Tencent was the most recent mega-cap company to benefit from investor enthusiasm for the tech sector, with its looming milestone a marker for the euphoria sweeping the stocks globally. Before Tuesday, the stock had added $251 billion in January alone -- by far the biggest creation of shareholder wealth worldwide. Warnings are rising that easy monetary policy is fueling bubbles in global equities, especially in the U.S., where gains have been led by the Nasdaq.

As investors seek cheaper alternatives, they’ve been piling into Hong Kong equities. That’s helped make the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks in the past month.

Story continues

While Tencent has long been an investor favorite in Asia, returning more than 100,000% since its 2004 initial public offering as of Monday, there are other risks to the rally.

In 2018, a government crackdown on China’s online gaming industry squeezed Tencent’s most profitable business, which at the time accounted for about 40% of its revenue. Coupled with a slowing Chinese economy and a weakening yuan, Beijing’s nine-month halt on approvals for new games contributed to a 22% slump in the shares.

A campaign against monopolistic practices since late last year has targeted many of the industries in which Tencent and rival Alibaba operate, including the online payments industry. But while increasing regulatory risk has left Alibaba’s shares about 18% lower than their October peak, Tencent has closed at a record in seven of the past nine sessions.

Tencent would be the second Chinese firm to join the trillion-dollar club after PetroChina Co., which was briefly worth more than that in late 2007 before collapsing in value. U.S. tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also worth more than $1 trillion each, as is Saudi Arabian Oil Co.

Tencent was founded in 1998 by four college classmates and a friend from Shenzhen who devised a Chinese version of the instant messaging service ICQ. Led by “Pony” Ma Huateng -- ma is Chinese for “horse” -- the company’s chat software became the primary communication tool for a generation of young Chinese.

Tencent’s surge has outpaced all but the most bullish analysts’ forecasts. The stock’s closing level of HK$766.50 on Monday was almost 10% higher than the consensus 12-month price target compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 2014.

U.S. tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also worth more than $1 trillion each, as is Saudi Arabian Oil Co.

Tencent was founded in 1998 by four college classmates and a friend from Shenzhen who devised a Chinese version of the instant messaging service ICQ. Led by “Pony” Ma Huateng -- ma is Chinese for “horse” -- the company’s chat software became the primary communication tool for a generation of young Chinese.

Tencent’s surge has outpaced all but the most bullish analysts’ forecasts. The stock’s closing level of HK$766.50 on Monday was almost 10% higher than the consensus 12-month price target compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 2014.

203,2021-01-25T21:06:20+00:00,The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for Semiconductors,"(Bloomberg) -- As China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan, leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy.

Taiwan, which China regards as a province, is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

Taiwan’s role in the world economy largely existed below the radar, until it came to recent prominence as the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S. and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.

U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.

The auto industry’s pleas illustrate how TSMC’s chip-making skills have handed Taiwan political and economic leverage in a world where technology is being enlisted in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China -- a standoff unlikely to ease under the administration of Joe Biden.

Taiwan’s grip on the semiconductor business -- despite being under constant threat of invasion by Beijing -- also represents a choke point in the global supply chain that’s giving new urgency to plans from Tokyo to Washington and Beijing to increase self-reliance.

By dominating the U.S.-developed model of outsourcing chip manufacture, Taiwan “is potentially the most critical single point of failure in the entire semiconductor value chain,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the technology and geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung.

The Trump administration exploited that pinch point to deny Beijing access to technology. By banning access to all U.S. chip technology including design, it was able to cut off the supply of semiconductors from TSMC and other foundries to Huawei Technologies, hobbling the advance of China’s biggest tech company.

It also negotiated with TSMC to establish a $12 billion chip fabrication plant in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is set to follow, with a $10 billion facility in Austin, Texas.

The “CHIPS for America Act” introduced to Congress last year aims to encourage more plants to be established in the U.S. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, plans to reintroduce the bipartisan bill this year with a view to securing $25 billion in federal funds and tax incentives. McCaul said in a statement he’s working with colleagues in the House and Senate “to prioritize getting the remaining provisions of CHIPS signed into law as quickly as possible.”

News that Intel Corp., the onetime industry leader, was considering outsourcing production of some chips to TSMC under its former CEO underscored the need for a U.S. player that can fabricate at the leading edge, said a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee staff who is not authorized to speak publicly.

The European Union aims to bolster the bloc’s “technological sovereignty” through an alliance armed initially with as much as 30 billion euros ($36 billion) of public-private investment to raise Europe’s share of the global chip market to 20% (without a target date) from less than 10% now.

It’s also encouraging Taiwan to increase investments in the 27-nation bloc, with some success. GlobalWafers Co. -- based in TSMC’s hometown of Hsinchu -- just boosted its offer for Germany’s Siltronic AG to value the company at 4.4 billion euros, an acquisition that would create the world’s largest silicon wafer maker by revenue.

That’s not to say Taiwan is the only player in the semiconductor supply chain. The U.S. still holds dominant positions, notably in chip design and electronic software tools; ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands has a monopoly on the machines needed to fabricate the best chips; Japan is a key supplier of equipment, chemicals and wafers.

But as the emphasis shifts to ever smaller, more powerful chips that require less energy, TSMC is increasingly in a field of its own. And it’s helped Taiwan form a comprehensive ecosystem around it: ASE Technology Holding is the world’s top chip assembler, while MediaTek has become the largest smartphone chipset vendor.

Tokyo, too, is attempting to attract TSMC to set up in Japan. With 110 billion yen ($1 billion) earmarked last year for R&D investment and another 90 billion yen for 2021, some of that may go to a TSMC facility, which reports have said the company is considering setting up in Japan.

“TSMC is becoming more and more dominant,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan’s Economy Ministry. “This is something everybody in the chip industry must find a way to deal with.”

China, in its five-year plan presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other key technologies to the tune of $1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even that kind of money doesn’t negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.

But with Washington stymieing China’s progress, there is also speculation that Beijing could resort to stealing chip IP, with Taiwan at the heart of those endeavors.

Taiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has observed a steady increase in attacks on the island’s chip industry corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on China. While it’s not always possible to know if these are Chinese state actors, “they are all attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry,” Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat analyst, said.

Fellow analyst Linda Kuo said the Taiwanese government was alarmed by a ransomware attack on TSMC in 2018 and had announced plans for some $500 million to help the industry become more aware of cyber security issues.

The greater worry is that TSMC’s chip factories could become collateral damage if China were to make good on threats to invade Taiwan if it moves toward independence.

TSMC's capital spending of as much as $28 billion for this year suggests it's going to stay out in front.

“Taiwan is the center of gravity of Chinese security policy,” said Mathieu Duchatel, director of the Asia program at the Institut Montaigne in Paris. Yet while Taiwan’s status in the global chip supply chain is a “huge strategic value,” it’s also a powerful reason for Beijing to stay away, said Duchatel, who’s just published a policy paper on China’s push for semiconductors.

Assuming Taiwanese forces were to be overwhelmed during an invasion, “there is no reason why they would leave these facilities intact,” he said. And preserving the world’s most advanced fabs “is in the interests of everyone.”

For all the moves to reel back domestic chip fabrication, it’s optimistic to think the supply chain for such a complex product as semiconductors could change in short order, Peter Wennink, ASML chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV. “If you want to reallocate semiconductor build capacity, manufacturing capacity, you have to think in years,” he said.

In the meantime, geopolitics means chip shortages could become a more regular occurrence, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.

“This is going to move on to the point where actually because of export controls, because of governmental intervention, there will be all of a sudden supply chain disruptions not just because of capacity problems,” he told Bloomberg Television. “So better get prepared.”

205,2021-01-25T20:38:07+00:00,The Bull Run on North American Markets Continues for Now,"A change in administrations is likely to impact the financial markets over the medium to long term. For now, US stock markets are running red-hot courtesy of four years of Trump’s pro-growth economic policies. The pandemic slammed the brakes on the global economy, but US markets rebounded sharply after a lull in Q1 2020. The recent riots notwithstanding, a peaceful transition from Republican to Democrat control has taken place.

The Biden administration has wasted no time reversing Trump-era policies with respect to Immigration, the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Paris Agreement, and other special interest subjects. A Democrat-led house, a 50-50 Senate with VP Harris able to cast the deciding vote, and a Democrat incumbent in the White House clears the way for sweeping legislative changes across the board. Already some shifts have taken place in the stock market, particularly with energy stocks as the environmental-friendly approach by Biden has cancelled all permits for the pipeline, as the US looks to alternative sources of energy and foreign oil.

The provincial government of Alberta is already feeling the heat, but the blowback is also impacting multiple oil stocks such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and a number of ETFs in the energy sector. The Goldman Sachs MLP Energy Infrastructure Fund, in addition to Vanguard’s Energy Fund are both down. Much of the bearish sentiment is unrelated to Biden’s executive orders; it has to do with a precipitous decline in demand owing to the pandemic, and Saudi Arabia's oil price war.

The historical chart for crude oil prices paints an interesting picture between 2016 and 2021. In 2016 the average closing price was $43.29 per barrel for WTI crude, rising to $50.80 per barrel in 2017, and $65.23 per barrel in 2018. In 2019, the average closing price per barrel was $56.99, and in 2020 the price dropped to a multi-year low of $39.68 per barrel. In 2021, the price has risen slightly over the course of the month to $51.95 per barrel.

Beyond energy stocks, tech stocks are doing particularly well. There are several stocks to watch including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Luminar Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:LAZR). These stocks have appreciated sharply in recent weeks. Apple Inc is particularly bullish, heading into February 2021. As can be seen from the chart below, the Ichimoku Cloud as a forward-leading indicator is strongly bullish, represented by the green cloud. Prices dipped slightly midway through January, but rose sharply to $139.07 per share (January 22, 2021). The performance of AAPL is similar in many respects to that of other leading tech stocks across the board.

Source: StockCharts Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)

It is worth pointing out that the Bollinger Bands for Apple are clearly reflective of a retracement to the downside. The upper Bollinger Band is currently at $138.11, the median band is at $131.57, and the lower band is at $125.03. The sharp appreciation in the price of Apple stock is likely to retrace as it reached overbought territory and a sell-off is expected with profit takers. This may reverse the price closer towards the median around $132 per share. The 50-day moving average price of AAPL is $125.58, and the 200-day moving average price is $105.20. The left-to-right price movements have been strongly bullish since Q4 2020.

Source: Yahoo! Finance Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE)

Expedia is another example of a tech stock with strong upward momentum. As seen from the above chart, the year-to-date performance of Expedia over the first 4 weeks of January has appreciated from $130.96 to the spot price of $136.52. The 52-week high for Expedia is $147.55, so there has been a retracement in the stock's price. The short-term, and mid-term performance outlook is bearish, but the long-term outlook is bullish.

While Expedia is deemed overvalued, with a -15.49 EPS, and a 1-year target estimate price of $127.96, the steadily increasing price outpaces the long-term moving average (200-day MA $96.30), and the short-term moving average (50-day MA $129.54). Bollinger Bands indicate that the current price is between the median and lower bands of $137.27 and $125.44 respectively. The downside retracement is due to the mini slump in recent days.

Source: StockCharts Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR)

Another tech stock which has shown promise heading into 2021 is Luminar Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: LAZR). The stock was trading flat throughout 2020, and experienced a massive spike between December 2020 and January 2021. The price shot up from under $10 per share to over $47 per share in double-quick time, before speculators sold to take profits. The price steadied around $34 per share, for massive gains in the New Year. Part of the reason why the stock is surging is Tesla. As a laser light and sensor company, Luminar Technologies Inc stock is used in AI vehicles for measuring distances, and is a critical component in self-driving vehicle technology.

What Happened: Luxshare said in a regulatory filing that it had been informed of two notices issued by the United States International Trade Commission related to a Section 337 investigation field against it by Amphenol Corporation (NYSE: APH), according to Reuters.

Amphenol — a Connecticut-based manufacturer of interconnect products — reportedly filed the complaint last month, alleging that certain electric components imported into the U.S. from Luxshare infringe on its patents for connector cables.

The concerns over the patent infringement sent Luxshare stock plummeting 9.5% in Shanghai on Monday.

Why It Matters: The China-based Luxshare makes connector cables for both the iPhone and Macbook products of Apple and also manufactures Airpods.

Last year, reports emerged that the Tim Cook-led tech giant had advised Luxshare to emerge as a more potent supply rival to Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) — better known as Foxconn.

Luxshare acquired two iPhone assembly plants from Taiwan’s Wistron Corporation in 2020, which unnerved some Foxconn executives, as per Reuters.

Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 1.6% higher at $139.07 on Friday and gained 0.93% in the after-hours session.

209,2021-01-25T04:33:32+00:00,Apple supplier Luxshare shares fall after U.S. patent infringement notice,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc supplier Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd fell as much as 9.5% on Monday, amid fresh concerns about a patent infringement investigation filed against it from the United States.

On Sunday, in a stock market filing, the company said it had been informed of two notices issued by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) regarding a Section 337 investigation filed against it by U.S.-based Amphenol Corp, alleging IP infringement.

Luxshare said it had hired a team of lawyers to respond and would ""follow procedure"" on the investigation, without elaborating, but re-iterated that the case ""will not have a material impact"" on its current operations and production.

Amphenol filed a section 337 complaint against Luxshare and its subsidiaries in December, alleging that certain electric components imported into the United States from Luxshare infringe on Amphenol's patents for connector cables.

Days later, Luxshare issued a statement saying it had learned of the complaint via USITC's website, and added it had established an internal working group to investigate the claims.

Founded in 2004, Luxshare has in recent years become a fast-rising supplier for Apple. It has steadily moved up the hardware giant's value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.

210,2021-01-25T04:33:32+00:00,Apple supplier Luxshare shares fall after U.S. patent infringement notice,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc supplier Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd fell as much as 9.5% on Monday, amid fresh concerns about a patent infringement investigation filed against it from the United States.

On Sunday, in a stock market filing, the company said it had been informed of two notices issued by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) regarding a Section 337 investigation filed against it by U.S.-based Amphenol Corp, alleging IP infringement.

Luxshare said it had hired a team of lawyers to respond and would ""follow procedure"" on the investigation, without elaborating, but re-iterated that the case ""will not have a material impact"" on its current operations and production.

Amphenol filed a section 337 complaint against Luxshare and its subsidiaries in December, alleging that certain electric components imported into the United States from Luxshare infringe on Amphenol's patents for connector cables.

Days later, Luxshare issued a statement saying it had learned of the complaint via USITC's website, and added it had established an internal working group to investigate the claims.

Founded in 2004, Luxshare has in recent years become a fast-rising supplier for Apple. It has steadily moved up the hardware giant's value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.

Last year the company acquired two iPhone assembly plant from Taiwan-based Wistron Corp.

That move unnerved some executives at Foxconn, the dominant maker of the handsets, and is seen by analysts as a sign of more indigenous Chinese companies making deeper inroads into Apple's supply chain.

Monday (January 25)

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: KIMBERLY-CLARK

Kimberly-Clark, an American multinational personal care corporation, is expected to report a profit of $1.62 in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a year-over-year decline of about 5.2% from the same quarter a year ago when the company reported $1.71 cents per share.

However, Wall Street forecasts the company’s revenue to grow over 3% to $4.7 from the same period year ago. For full-year 2020, revenue is expected to be at $19.1 billion.

“We maintain our Buy-rating and above-consensus EPS estimate into KMB’s 4Q report BMO on Monday. Kimberly Clark’s (KMB) shares have lagged staples as the market remains concerned about moderating POS trends in Dec/Jan and commodities; however, we see an upside to Street 4Q20 and ’21/’22 ests. w/commodity inflation reasonably reflected at current spots and view the bar as low into the print w/KMB trading at 16x P/E (30% discount to HPC peers vs. 20% hist. avg.),” noted Kevin Grundy, equity analyst at Jefferies, who rated the paper products giant “Buy” and set the price target at $152.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: MICROSOFT

MICROSOFT: The global technology giant is expected to report a profit of $1.64 in the fiscal second quarter, which represents year-over-year growth of about 8.6% from the same quarter last year when the company reported $1.51 per share.

The world’s largest software maker’s revenue is forecasts come at $40.23, up from the $36.91 billion reported the same quarter a year earlier.

“Q2 results likely highlight the durability of Microsoft‘s commercial businesses and conservatism in forward consensus expectations. After clearing tough Q2 product cycle comps and lingering COVID-19 impacts, strong secular positioning and an attractive multiple make Microsoft (MSFT) a top stock for the recovery,” said Keith Weiss, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“At 26x CY22e GAAP EPS, MSFT trades at a premium to the S&P, warranted due to MSFT‘s premium return profile. Multiple expansion will likely come from gaining comfort in the durability of commercial business gross profit dollars.”

Johnson & Johnson, one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive manufacturers of healthcare products, will post earnings of $1.83 per share for last quarter of 2020.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: APPLE, TESLA, FACEBOOK

APPLE: The consumer electronics giant is expected to report profit growth of more than 12% of $1.41 in the fiscal first quarter of 2021 on sales of $102.61 billion, highlighted growth of over 11% from the year-ago quarter. That growth is largely driven by a strong demand iPhone handset, Mac computers, iPad tablets and wearables in the holiday season.

“Our December quarter revenue of $108.2B is 5% above consensus, while our EPS of $1.50 is 7% above consensus. We expect demand strength to continue and our FY21 revenue and EPS estimates are both 5% above consensus,” wrote Katy Huberty, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Given positioning into the quarter is muted after the rotation out of high-quality stocks over the past several months, we expect strong follow-through post-earnings and are buyers into the print. We also raise our price target to $152, from $144, as we mark our price target to market accounting for recent peer multiple expansion.”

TESLA: The California-based electric vehicle and clean energy company is expected to report a profit of $1.04 in the fourth quarter of 2020, posting a profit for the sixth straight quarter. The manufacturer of high-performance electric vehicles’ revenue is forecast to surge about 35% to $10 billion.

“A double-fly-wheel. We believe Tesla can leverage its cost leadership in EVs to aggressively expand its user base, over time generating a higher % of revenue from recurring/high-margin services revenue. Services drive the upside. We forecast Tesla’s (TSLA) network services EBITDA as a % of total TSLA EBITDA to reach 11% by 2025, 19% by 2030 and 37% by 2040. Tesla Service revenue includes automated driving, infotainment, upgrades, supercharging, maintenance, telematics, etc.,” said Adam Jonas, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Valuation supportive vs. tech. Including Network Services, Energy & Insurance to our core auto forecasts, at $810 Tesla trades at 25x EV/EBITDA in 2025 and 5x 2025 sales. Expensive vs. auto but not vs. software/tech comps.”

FACEBOOK: The world’s largest online social network is expected to report a profit of $3.16 in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents year-over-year growth of 23.4% from the same quarter a year ago when the company reported $2.56 cents per share.

According to the Zacks Research, the social media conglomerate’s revenue will increase of 24.7% to $26.29 billion from the year-ago, largely driven by solid ad-revenue growth amid advertiser demand during the holiday period.

“Monetization Potential: We are positive on FB‘s monetization roll-out of Instagram as well as FB’s ability to continue to innovate and improve its monetization (Canvas Ads, Dynamic Ads, video). Combined with the high and growing engagement we see monetization upside going forward,” noted Brian Nowak, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Investing from Position of Strength to Drive Faster Long-Term Growth: We are modeling 29% GAAP opex (excl. one-time items) growth in 2021, implying an incremental $15bn in opex. Our base case model implies opex per employee moderates in ’21 while FB hiring remains roughly flat on an absolute basis. We believe FB will grow EPS at a 28% CAGR (2019-2022).”

The broader market positivity comes as Wall Street celebrates the possibility of more government spending on coronavirus relief under the Biden administration.

All three major U.S. indexes did slip slightly through early afternoon trading Friday, yet they rest within striking distance of their all-time highs. The S&P 500 is currently up around 3.8% since the start of January trading and nearly 18% since the end of October.

Along with further stimulus hope, some of the big banks and other early earnings results have come in strong. The overall fourth quarter outlook has continued to improve and S&P 500 earnings are projected to surge back in 2021. Investors should note that Microsoft MSFT, Apple, Facebook FB, Tesla TSLA, and countless other heavy hitters are all projected to report their quarterly results next week (also read: Early Q4 Results Show an Improving Earnings Picture).

Investors also continue to appear bullish as they bet that the vaccine will help things return to something closer to normal later this year. So now might be a good time to consider some highly-ranked, high-flying stocks that fit within the broader technology basket.

TechTarget, Inc. TTGT

TechTarget is an intent-driven digital marketing and sales services firm that works within the enterprise technology sphere. TTGT creates an array of editorial content for its clients to help potential consumers find their companies and offering in our crowded online world. TechTarget stock has soared 175% in the past year and it has expanded its reach through acquisitions recently.

The company closed its deal to buy BrightTALK in late December, which added “a leading marketing platform for webinars and virtual events in the enterprise IT market” to its portfolio. TTGT then announced in early January its purchase of The Enterprise Strategy Group.

Story continues

The first-party purchase intent data firm is projected to see its FY20 revenue climb over 8%, based on our Zacks estimates. This would follow 10% top-line expansion in FY19 and 12% in 2018. TechTarget’s fiscal 2021 revenue is then projected to soar 46% to $212 million, with its adjusted earnings expected to surge by 19% and 35%, respectively during this stretch. The company stands to benefit as companies search for ways to improve their tech infrastructure.

TTGT has beat our earnings estimates in the trailing two periods and its overall bottom-line outlook has improved significantly to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. TechTarget also grabs a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and it sits right near its new highs at $72 a share.

The stock is up 50% in the last three months and 375% in the last three years. And despite trading near new records, its valuation marks a 15% discount compared to its own year-long highs in terms of forward sales.

Micron MU

Micron is one of the largest makers of DRAM and NAND memory chips in the world and it has made an impressive comeback within the cyclical space over the past six months. The memory chip firm returned to growth in Q3, with sales up 14% and fourth quarter revenue up 24%.

The Boise, Idaho-headquartered company then beat our Q1 FY21 estimates on January 7 and also provided strong guidance. MU stands to benefit from strong demand from 5G, cloud computing, automotive, and elsewhere this year and beyond.

Zacks estimate calls for MU’s FY21 revenue to jump 16%, with FY22 projected to climb over 25% higher to $31.1 billion. Better still, MU’s adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 36% this year and a whopping 98% in fiscal 2022. Clearly, Micron’s growth momentum is set to return and analysts have raced to up their bottom-line estimates to help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

Micron stock is up over 55% in the past three months after it began to break out of a rough stretch in August of 2020. MU shares are now up 688% over the last five years to more than double the semiconductor industry’s average and it might be poised to keep on climbing.

Micron’s run has stretched its valuation to its highest levels in years. That said, given the memory space’s commodity-like standing within chips, it still trades at a big discount to its industry overall. And 14 of the 21 brokerage recommendations that Zacks has for Micron come in a “Strong Buy” with three more at a “Buy.”

SolarEdge SEDG

SolarEdge has benefitted from the Biden victory as Wall Street bets on an increased push toward renewable energy. The company might not be a traditional “tech” stock. Yet its inverters convert the DC power that photovoltaic solar panels produce into the AC power used in our homes and businesses.

The company’s offerings aim to “maximize power generation at the individual PV module-level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar PV system” and are poised to remain a vital part of the solar energy industry for years.

The Fremont, California-based firm aims to be the “leading provider of inverter solutions across all PV market segments” and it competes in a similar space to fellow high-flyer Enphase ENPH. Like many of its peers, SEDG stock has dipped after the massive Biden/Democratic-based run, down around 15% from early January highs. Despite the pullback, which might make it more attractive, the stock has soared 190% in the last 12 months.

SolarEdge, which aims to help speed up the transition to a modern, futuristic power grid, has seen its sales climb from under $500 million in 2016 to $1.4 billion in FY19. Zacks estimates call for its FY20 sales to climb slightly in 2020, dragged down by rough conditions for the overall energy sector.

Peeking ahead, its FY21 revenue is projected to jump 19% hit $1.7 billion, with its adjusted EPS figure set to climb 14%. The stock has crushed our EPS estimates in three out of the last four quarters and its improving earning revision help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). SolarEdge also sports an “A” grade for Momentum and its Solar space rests in the top 30% of our over 250 Zacks industries.

216,2021-01-22T17:43:22+00:00,It’s Time to Give GOEV Stock a Green Light,"I’ve always had a sense that to make the promise of electric vehicles (EVs) come to fruition; the industry would require a different way of thinking. That’s one reason for you to consider an investment in Canoo (NYSE:GOEV). It’s understandable if you’re just getting up to speed on Canoo. The company went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) late last year. Canoo trades under the ticker symbol GOEV stock. an electric car plugged in for charging, representing electric car stocks

Innovation is a word that gets thrown around a lot. But sometimes innovative just means different. However in the case of Canoo, the company is really doing taking an innovative approach to building an EV. That got the attention of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the company is reportedly pursuing a contract manufacturing deal with the auto parts giant Magna International (NYSE:MGA).

Not Your Mother’s Minivan

As the EV sector becomes more crowded, it’s important to have differentiation. The novel approach that Canoo takes is one reason to consider the stock. The company is entering the market with two offerings. The first is what it termed a multipurpose delivery vehicle (MPDV). Or, if you glance at the schematic, it might better be called a party bus.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day

This is because of the innovative design. As Luke Lango wrote, the basic precept with any traditionally fueled or electric vehicle designs is that they are meant to be…driven. That makes sense, right? Well the thing is we’re becoming a society where people want to get from point A to point B without worrying about that driving stuff.

Canoo’s vehicle is not there yet. But the “by wire” system being employed in the design is an essential part of the company’s “skateboard” platform. And down the road, it will be the key to providing the vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities.

The company is also looking to put this design to work in a last-mile delivery vehicle.

Story continues

A Minimal Commitment

Another reason to consider GOEV stock is the way the company plans to sell the vehicles. In fact, the word sell is not appropriate. Canoo is offering consumers a lease with virtually no commitment. Essentially the company will have an SaaS model for electric vehicles. Consumers can pick out a vehicle and lease it for a specified period of time (minimum of 30 days). After their subscription ends, they can simply return the vehicle. There’s no long-term contract. And they can return it anytime.

Yeah, it’s kinda cool. Like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) but with a car. But it’s more than that. It will afford the company with higher margins because, in theory, one vehicle will have multiple “owners” throughout its life. And that makes the company irresistible to analysts.

The Electric Vehicle Revolution is Real

The electric vehicle sector has always been an intriguing industry. But it always seemed like all the tumblers were never in place. When there was the political will, the technology was years away. In the last few years, the technology has caught up but the Trump administration had a policy of benign neglect towards the sector.

But there was a new wind blowing down Pennsylvania Avenue. That wind is blowing in an administration that has said that electric vehicles will be a key part of its agenda. This means that investors should view the sector with a little less speculation.

Buy a Little GOEV Stock Now, Buy More Later

Canoo will have no revenue for at least another year. A lot can happen between now and then so it’s not fair to say nothing can go wrong. We all know that things can go awry. And since prudence is a good virtue to have, I recommend prudence with GOEV stock. Now would be a good time to take a small position on the stock. The stock is just starting to move higher, but will likely have some volatility as the lockup period ends.

217,2021-01-22T15:53:33+00:00,5 Stocks to Buy in 2021 for Rapid-Fire Growth,"This is a year of innovation. The top stocks to buy in 2021 will reflect that and will represent huge growth opportunities for investors. Think the next generation of electric vehicles (EVs). Alternate energy plays. Space travel. Legal cannabis. Fintech disruptors. These themes accelerated in 2020 and will propel winning stocks higher this year.

Acknowledging all of the change the novel coronavirus pandemic drove in recent months, Seismic Capital Company President Eric White is looking at these emerging themes to pick stocks. He told InvestorPlace that as a new normal solidifies, new opportunities will emerge in the stock market.

“My advice would be to continue to follow the recent growth sectors, but side-step the ones that have been growing solely because of the pandemic, as it won’t last forever. Also, be sure to look at ‘green companies’ as growth continues in this sector in both the U.S. and worldwide. … [T]he new Biden administration will be pushing for infrastructure legislation, and many of the funds would be allocated to further alternative energy production and other pro-environmental policies that will help those related businesses.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Considering these trends, however, investors do face one big challenge. Seemingly every day a new initial public offering (IPO) or special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) stock advertises itself as a huge growth opportunity in a hot field. How do you sort through the noise and find the real winners? As you do your own research, White recommends mapping out the big picture for each company.

“For general investors, my advice is to also look at industry comps and make sure to pay attention to how the company will sustain growth rather than just how rapidly a company is growing. Also, be sure to monitor the general market for the company you’re interested in, as well as their competitors, and their traction within the space.”

7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day

With that in mind, InvestorPlace has rounded up five top stocks to buy in 2021 for rapid-fire growth. Each company on this list represents a sustainable, long-term growth trend:

Nio (NYSE:NIO) Stem (NYSE:STPK) Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) Momentus (NASDAQ:SRAC)

Stocks to Buy in 2021: Nio (NIO) Image of Nio (NIO) logo branded on the exterior of a corporate building.

There is no denying that Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio has already come far. Shares started 2020 below $5 and now trade for nearly $60. The company has blown past concerns it would run out of cash, emerging as an innovative and fast-growing EV leader.

So where does the company go next? As one of the top stocks to buy for 2021, many analysts are starting to raise their price targets. JPMorgan analyst Nick Lai just raised his price target to $75, while Credit Suisse analyst Bin Wang raised his to $71. However, InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango sees much more upside ahead for NIO stock, even to $150. That’s because the company continues to deliver on its promises and chart a growth-filled course.

In fact, Nio kicked off the year with bold plans. It unveiled its first all-electric sedan, giving it further leverage in its battle against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Not only is this sedan a great way to target another niche of the passenger market, it also comes with brand-new autonomous vehicle tech. Investors should see the new ET7 as a milestone for Nio with battery, AV and vehicle design advancements.

Now, Nio just needs one catalyst to bring that $150 price target into the spotlight. CEO William Li has previously mentioned plans to expand outside of China. Over the summer, he identified Europe as the next target market. Talk of expansion has grown cold since then, but bulls are still confident. The company recently started advertising for job openings in Oslo, Norway. If we receive more confirmation of those plans in 2021, rapid-fire growth will be on the way.

Stem may not be a household name, but experts are confident it is about to transform the renewable energy landscape. In fact, iconic Citron Research said it is the most exciting alt-energy play since Tesla. That is high praise and speaks to why STPK is one of the top stocks to buy in 2021.

For unfamiliar investors, Stem is an energy storage play currently trading through blank-check company Star Peak Energy Transition. When the deal closes, likely this quarter, it will start trading under the ticker STEM.

So, what does Citron like about STPK stock? The company is one of the last pure plays on energy storage to come public. Plus, it already has an edge against competitors. Stem specializes in behind-the-meter storage, which means it provides on-site storage options. The company started on its growth path by owning the batteries, software, contracts and services for these on-site storage options. However, as the company comes public, it is moving into the front-of-meter market. To do this, it is increasingly relying on its Athena platform, a software offering that blends artificial intelligence (AI) with energy storage. Athena essentially allows customers to optimize energy use and cut costs.

That is where Citron really sees potential. In a recent note, the firm said that Stem is a leader in the AI-driven energy storage market and “couldn’t be better positioned.” And perhaps most importantly, it seems that energy storage will be key as President Joe Biden targets $2 trillion in clean energy infrastructure investments.

7 Stocks To Buy As The Biden Presidency Begins

Looking to the future, Stem will offer rapid-fire growth if it can lean into this front-of-meter shift. Investors should also note that the company is looking to use its SPAC merger proceeds to fund expansion into Europe, Japan and Canada.

Affirm (AFRM) Affirm (AFRM) logo displayed on a smartphone

One of the top themes Seismic Capital President Eric White identified for 2021 is fintech and it is easy to see why.

Fintech stocks have prevailed in recent months, continuing their disruption of traditional financial institutions. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and its peers are starting to embrace cryptocurrencies. These companies also led the way with direct payments and small business loans as part of the CARES Act. And this disruption will only continue as names like SoFi and Payoneer come public.

However, one segment of the fintech market is particularly interesting right now. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) firms represent a new era of retail and recent IPO Affirm stands out in that category. Essentially, BNPL companies are the next generation of payment installment solutions. Not too sure about dropping $100 on an online purchase? What about four interest-free payments of $25? Affirm says it encourages customers to buy more, supporting the retailers it partners with.

This has been particularly true amid Covid-19, especially as more retailers rely on e-commerce models. Current Affirm partners include Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). According to CEO Max Levchin, a former PayPal executive, demand for its solutions quadrupled in the first months of the pandemic. If that growth can continue, it will certainly be one of the top stocks to buy in 2021.

So, what should fintech-hungry investors be looking for? As InvestorPlace Market Analyst Tom Yeung wrote, Affirm looks like a stock to instantly add to cart. If the company can avoid traditional moneylending risks, it has a massive growth runway. Look for it to add new customers as well as for its existing customers to grow as e-commerce blossoms.

Canoo (GOEV) An electric vehicle is hooked up to a charging cable.

Nio is not the only electric car stock promising big growth this year. On the other side of the world, startup Canoo looks ready to transform transportation as we know it and will be one of the most compelling stocks to buy in 2021.

Canoo wants to change the way cars look as well as the way we buy them. It started on this path by rolling out plans for its flagship passenger vehicle. The company rethinks what consumers want, creating more space for riders and adding fully customizable features. Instead of offering its Canoo at a set price, it touts a subscription model. Designed to lower the overall cost of vehicle ownership and get at the heart of the young, city-living driver, the company thinks it can cash in on growing transportation trends.

Importantly, Canoo is also differentiating itself by moving into a different niche of the EV market. Right as it started trading, the company revealed plans for a last-mile delivery vehicle. The multi-purpose delivery vehicle (MPDV) has the same futuristic look. It also promises to maximize cargo capacity while reducing costs for customers.

So, where is the growth for GOEV stock? According its own executives, the MPDV taps huge EV potential with its focus on both last-mile delivery fleets and independent contractors. Plus, as competition in the passenger EV space heats up, the MPDV allows Canoo to soar on its own terms. Right now, the company needs to bring these vehicles to life and ultimately prove what it is capable of. If it can do that, GOEV stock could soon hit the consensus $30 price target, which implies more than 70% upside.

The 7 Best Stocks To Buy In The Dow Jones Today

There is also one more path for growth here. Earlier this month, we learned that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was in talks with Canoo, either to acquire it or make an investment. Those talks fell apart, but they represent serious potential. Building on that interest and attracting new big-name partners would be a game-changer for GOEV stock this year.

Momentus (SRAC) space shuttle launching into space

One of the most interesting themes to watch in 2021 may just be space. That’s because Ark Invest just announced a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on all things space — and investors are paying close attention. Soon to trade under the ticker ARKX, the fund promises to bring the up-and-coming space economy to the mainstream.

According to Luke Lango, we are embarking on a new age that will see companies commercialize space like never before. As they do so, this space economy will grow to nearly $2 trillion in 2040, up 400% from today. Backing from Ark and its founder Cathie Wood, as well as analysts like Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley, guarantees that this innovative sector will continue to heat up.

Right now, investors can access pure plays like Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) and Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR). However, there is one lesser-known play that stands out as a stock to buy. That company is Momentus, which is currently trading through Stable Road Acquisition under the ticker SRAC.

Momentus says it is the first company offering the infrastructure that will allow humans to flourish in space. These infrastructure services include last-mile satellite and cargo delivery, payload hosting and in-orbit servicing. In other words, Momentus wants to make space missions as easy as possible. Through a satellite-as-a-service business model, or what some call a space tow truck service, SRAC stock promises to capitalize on the growing space economy and be one of the best stocks to buy in 2021. Plus, it looks like an awfully good fit for that ARKX ETF.

Revenues from signings fell 18% (at constant currency or cc) in the fourth quarter to $12.1 billion. Backlog amounted to $110.8 billion, down 4% at cc (down 1% at actual) on a year-over-year basis.

Nevertheless, total Cloud revenues were $7.5 billion during the quarter, up 10% year over year. Adjusting for currency and divested businesses, total cloud revenues increased 8%. The company witnessed solid uptake of cloud-based solutions and digital transformation offerings, driven by synergies from Red Hat acquisition.

Notably, shares of IBM are down more than 8% in the pre-market trading on Jan 22. The downside can be attributed to mixed results, and sentiments pertaining to straight revenue declines on a year-over-year basis for the fourth time in the year.

In the past one year, shares of IBM are down 6.4%, compared with industry’s decline of 11.4%.

Spin-Off to Boost Prospects in Hybrid Cloud

IBM had announced the spin-off of its legacy Managed Infrastructure Services business in a bid to accelerate its hybrid cloud growth strategy. The company aims to focus better on enabling clients with accelerated digital transformation and capitalize on “the $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity.”

The company’s Managed Infrastructure Services, a unit of its Global Technology Services division, will be spun off into a new public company or NewCo (set to be named later). IBM recently announced that the new company will be helmed by Martin Schroeter as a CEO.

The spin-off is anticipated to strengthen its presence in two different territories by creating two entities to realize business goals and best outcomes. IBM’s open hybrid cloud platform and AI expertise are poised to get a boost from the new deal. Meanwhile, NewCo is set to gain new capabilities and greater agility to modernize the architecture of the enterprises.

219,2021-01-22T15:27:03+00:00,"Q4 Earnings Come to Regional Banks: ALLY, HBAN &amp; More","Friday, January 22, 2021

Back to the grind of Q4 earnings season this morning, with next week set to ramp-up even stronger with the total amount of companies and marquee names reporting for Q4. Most of the big banks have already posted for Q4; this morning — aside from a slight miss from Kansas City Southern KSU and a slight beat from Schlumberger SLB — we see a large share of Regional Banks reporting quarterly earnings. There isn’t time here to account for them all, so we’ll stick with just those carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) into the morning’s report.

Headquartered in Sandy, UT and founded in 2009, Ally Bank ALLY easily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines: $1.60 per share was well in front of the $1.05 expected and $0.95 reported a year ago, on $1.98 billion in revenues which outpaced the $1.65 billion estimate and $1.64 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Honolulu-based First Hawaiian Bank FHB posted 50 cents per share versus 42 cents in the Zacks consensus for its Q4 earnings report.

220,2021-01-22T14:42:07+00:00,Intel Tumbles After New CEO Recommits to Chip Manufacturing,"(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares tumbled after the incoming chief executive officer pledged to regain the company’s lead in chip manufacturing, countering growing calls from some investors to shed that part of its business.

“I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally,” Pat Gelsinger said on a conference call to discuss financial results. “At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it’s likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products.”

He plans to provide more details after officially taking over the CEO role Feb. 15, however Gelsinger was clear that Intel is sticking with its once-mighty manufacturing operation.

“We’re not just interested in closing gaps,” he told analysts on a conference call Thursday. “We’re interested in resuming that position as the unquestioned leader in process technology.”

Keeping production in-house may be bad for Intel because its manufacturing technology has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for many of Intel’s rivals. If the U.S. company can’t catch up, its products will become less competitive and it could lose sales and market share.

Intel shares fell 5.7%% at 9:36 a.m. in New York on Friday. They have declined about 6% over the last 12 months compared with a 16% increase in the S&P 500.

Activist Dan Loeb has suggested the company consider spinning off its manufacturing business. Other investors have been waiting to see if Intel will outsource more production.

“Where investors are going to be disappointed is that some were expecting some sort of larger announcement of a strategic partnership with TSMC,” said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Logan Purk.

TSMC recently announced capital spending of as much as $28 billion for 2021 to maintain its lead. Purk said Intel would have to increase its own spending massively to try to catch the Asian company.

TSMC dropped 3.6%, the most since March 23. Shares of some Intel suppliers also dropped, with Screen Holdings Co. down 3.7% and Tokyo Electron Ltd. declined 1.6%.

Gelsinger is taking the reins of a company in the midst of its worst crisis in at least a decade. It has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years, dominating the $400 billion industry by making the best designs in its own cutting-edge factories. Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold plants and tapped other firms to make the components. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operations and created better semiconductors.

That strategy has crumbled in recent years as Intel struggled to introduce new production techniques on time. It is now lagging behind TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., which make chips for Intel competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and big Intel customers including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.

AMD shares rallied in extended trading while Gelsinger discussed his goal of improving Intel’s in-house manufacturing.

Intel’s quarterly results, released before the market closed on Thursday, initially sent the shares higher. A hacker accessed sensitive information from Intel’s website, prompting the company to report the numbers earlier than planned.

Revenue in the period ending in March will be about $17.5 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said. This excludes the memory chip division Intel is selling. Analysts were looking for $16.2 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Intel sees strong demand for laptops through the first half of the year, Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview. Earnings in the second part of the year will partly depend on whether corporations increase spending on new hardware, he added.

“The question is will we see support from enterprise,” he said. “They’ve been very quiet.”

Intel’s personal computer chip division had revenue of $10.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts expected $9.72 billion. Its higher-margin data center unit generated sales of $6.1 billion. Wall Street was looking for $5.37 billion.

In Intel’s data center business, revenue from cloud service providers fell 15% from a year earlier. Enterprise and government sales slumped 25%. Volumes and average selling prices declined. Owners of large data centers are working their way through unused stockpiles of chips.

In its PC business, Intel reported a 30% surge in laptop chip sales, even as average selling prices declined 15%.

Fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, was $1.52 a share on $20 billion of revenue, down 1% from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated $1.11 a share on revenue of $17.5 billion.

Intel’s gross margin, the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of production, was 56.8%. This is a key indicator of the strength of its manufacturing and product pricing. Intel has historically delivered margins of about 60%.

222,2021-01-22T04:00:48+00:00,12 Biggest Companies with Gay CEOs,"In this article we are going to list the 12 biggest companies with gay CEOs. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest companies with gay CEOs.

A couple of decades ago it was not usual to find an openly-gay person at a senior position in any organization. This is because while companies claimed to be a welcoming place for LGBT, the reality was far-fetched. People from LGBT had to fight for their basic rights for a prolonged period. For example, in 2013 the Supreme Court of USA allowed the government to not provide federal benefits to homosexual couples. It is only five years ago same-sex marriages have been legalized in the USA and then later on in other parts of the world.

Even then, while the United States has banned discrimination based on sexuality, many people still face a lot of discrimination in the workplace, which is quite hard to fight off and can often be at a subtle enough level that it gets quite hard to prove. Even a couple of decades ago the concept of LGBT workplace protection was relatively unheard of and many companies used to lay off people based on their sexuality. Moreover, people have now become more vocal against companies that marginalize LGBT. But still, even in today’s world, many companies prefer to have a heterosexual person as their CEO.

You will note that many companies which have become accepting enough to have gay CEOs belong to the developed world. This is because despite the fact that advancements have been made, these advancements have mostly been restricted to only developed economies, where the view on human rights is drastically different from other countries, especially those based in Asia and Africa. Countries in these continents mostly still have laws against gay relations and same sex acts, and it doesn't look like this will end anytime soon. Many countries have these arcane laws because of religion; Islam has a very strict stance against homosexuality leaving little wiggle room and these countries have adopted rules to reflect that very stance. This is why in some African and Asian countries, same sex acts are actually punishable by death. You can learn more about these countries if you visit the 15 most dangerous companies for gay travelers.

Having said that, there are still many well-known Chief Executive Officers who came out as gay and became a source of inspiration for the young generation belonging to the LBGT community. For example, the appointment of Inga Beale was a CEO of Lloyd in 2014 was hailed by many as they claimed that it will encourage other organizations to have more visible LGBT representation. Similarly, it was Tim Cook who paved the way for other LGBT leaders by becoming the very first openly gay CEO of a renowned company that is a part of the Fortune 500 list. However, even companies which are said to be gay-friendly such as Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) Now, if you search for the biggest companies with gay CEOs, other than Apple and a few others, there are few proper lists. To ensure that our data was correct, we checked the revenues of these companies either from Forbes, Fortune or their own annual reports, with foreign currencies converted to US dollars. Therefore let's take a look at the 15 biggest companies with CEOs that are challenging the status quo by being openly gay, starting of course with number 15:

224,2021-01-21T11:00:17+00:00,Apple’s First Headset to Be Niche Precursor to Eventual AR Glasses,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s first crack at a headset is designed to be a pricey, niche precursor to a more ambitious augmented reality product that will take longer to develop, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The initial device has confronted several development hurdles and the company has conservative sales expectations, illustrating how challenging it will be to bring this nascent consumer technology to the masses.

As a mostly virtual reality device, it will display an all-encompassing 3-D digital environment for gaming, watching video and communicating. AR functionality, the ability to overlay images and information over a view of the real world, will be more limited. Apple has planned to launch the product as soon as 2022, going up against Facebook Inc.’s Oculus, Sony Corp.’s PlayStation VR and headsets from HTC Corp., the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing private plans.

Apple’s typical playbook involves taking emerging consumer technology, such as music players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, and making it reliable and easy to use for everyone. This time, though, Apple isn’t looking to create an iPhone-like hit for its first headset. Instead, the company is building a high-end, niche product that will prepare outside developers and consumers for its eventual, more mainstream AR glasses.

The plans suggest that Apple’s first headset will be far more expensive than those from rivals, which cost about $300 to $900. Some Apple insiders believe the company may sell only one headset per day per retail store. Apple has roughly 500 stores, so in that scenario, annual sales would be just over 180,000 units — excluding other sales channels. That would put it on par with other pricey Apple products, such as the $5,999 Mac Pro desktop computer. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.

Apple is aiming to include some of its most advanced and powerful chips in the headset along with displays that are much higher-resolution than those in existing VR products. Some of the chips tested in the device beat the performance of Apple’s M1 Mac processors. The company has also designed the headset with a fan, something the company usually tries to avoid on mobile products, the people said.

Story continues

The headset, codenamed N301, is in a late prototype stage, but is not yet finalized so the company’s plans could change or be scrapped entirely before launch. The AR glasses, codenamed N421, are in an early stage known as “architecture,” meaning Apple is still working on underlying technologies. This product is several years away, according to the people, though Apple has previously targeted as early as 2023 to unveil it.

The powerful processors and the inclusion of a fan initially led to a device that was too large and heavy with some concern about neck strain in early testing. Apple removed the space VR gadgets usually reserve for users who need to wear eyeglasses, which brought the headset closer to the face and helped shrink the size. And to address consumers with poorer eyesight, it developed a system where custom prescription lenses can be inserted into the headset over the VR screens, the people said.

This may expose Apple to regulations governing the sale of products with prescriptions. The company typically sells its devices in dozens of countries, many of which have different prescription rules. Apple is also discussing how it would implement prescriptions at the point of sale online and in retail stores.

Apple originally planned to include less powerful processors and offload much of the work to a hub in a user’s home that would wirelessly beam content to the headset. But that idea was squashed by Jony Ive, Apple’s design chief at the time, Bloomberg News reported last year. The headset is designed to work as a standalone device, meaning it can operate on a battery rather than be plugged into a wall or a Mac. That’s similar to Facebook’s latest VR product, while Sony’s requires a PlayStation gaming console.

To further reduce the device’s weight, Apple is planning to use a fabric exterior. That’s a departure from the metal designs Apple uses for most products, though it has used plastic for devices like AirPods, that need to be light, and fabrics for the HomePod speaker to improve acoustics.

Prototypes of the headset, some of which are about the size of an Oculus Quest, include external cameras to enable some AR features. The company is testing using the cameras for hand-tracking and is working on a feature where a user can type virtually in the air to input text. It’s unclear if that function will be ready for the first version of the device or if it will ever leave the exploratory stage.

The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted some development with Apple hardware engineers only being able to work on certain days from the office. The company has also faced delays conducting user testing and data collection. That has slowed some decisions in the engineering process.

The company is also still grappling with what content and functionality it intends to ship with the device. Virtual reality is still a somewhat nascent technology, with content beyond games still relatively limited. Last year, Apple acquired a company called NextVR, which recorded events such as concerts and sports games in virtual reality. It’s also discussed bundling an App Store with the device, which runs on an operating system dubbed “rOS” inside the company.

If Apple goes ahead with the VR headset, it would be a precursor to an eventual pair of AR glasses — a product that the company sees as far more mainstream but also more difficult to launch. Microsoft Corp.’s HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap’s headset, which emphasize AR over VR, retail for $3,500 and $2,295 respectively. HoloLens mostly focuses on work use cases still, while Magic Leap fell well short of the early hype and slashed jobs last year.

Apple first added AR to the iPhone in 2017, allowing new mobile games and apps like those for virtually placing furniture in your living room before buying it. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said both virtual and augmented reality have potential, but that AR is the larger opportunity.

AR glasses must be packed with small, powerful and efficient electronics to overlay notifications, map directions and other information while supporting internet connectivity and strong battery life. That’s a huge technical challenge. Even Oculus, which released its first all-in-one VR headset in 2019, won’t include AR features in its first glasses this year.

Getting to that point requires years of work on lenses, hardware and software, component miniaturization, production techniques and content creation. Critically, getting most people to wear a computer on their face, even a small one, is difficult. That, in part, doomed Google’s early attempt at consumer AR glasses several years ago.

By developing a less mainstream initial headset, Apple can invest in the underlying technologies, consumer education, content development and developer relations to give its eventual AR glasses the best opportunity to be successful — when they are ready.

As a mostly virtual reality device, it will display an all-encompassing 3-D digital environment for gaming, watching video and communicating. AR functionality, the ability to overlay images and information over a view of the real world, will be more limited. Apple has planned to launch the product as soon as 2022, going up against Facebook Inc.’s Oculus, Sony Corp.’s PlayStation VR and headsets from HTC Corp., the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing private plans.

Apple’s typical playbook involves taking emerging consumer technology, such as music players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, and making it reliable and easy to use for everyone. This time, though, Apple isn’t looking to create an iPhone-like hit for its first headset. Instead, the company is building a high-end, niche product that will prepare outside developers and consumers for its eventual, more mainstream AR glasses.

The plans suggest that Apple’s first headset will be far more expensive than those from rivals, which cost about $300 to $900. Some Apple insiders believe the company may sell only one headset per day per retail store. Apple has roughly 500 stores, so in that scenario, annual sales would be just over 180,000 units — excluding other sales channels. That would put it on par with other pricey Apple products, such as the $5,999 Mac Pro desktop computer. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.

Apple is aiming to include some of its most advanced and powerful chips in the headset along with displays that are much higher-resolution than those in existing VR products. Some of the chips tested in the device beat the performance of Apple’s M1 Mac processors. The company has also designed the headset with a fan, something the company usually tries to avoid on mobile products, the people said.

The headset, codenamed N301, is in a late prototype stage, but is not yet finalized so the company’s plans could change or be scrapped entirely before launch. The AR glasses, codenamed N421, are in an early stage known as “architecture,” meaning Apple is still working on underlying technologies. This product is several years away, according to the people, though Apple has previously targeted as early as 2023 to unveil it.

The powerful processors and the inclusion of a fan initially led to a device that was too large and heavy with some concern about neck strain in early testing. Apple removed the space VR gadgets usually reserve for users who need to wear eyeglasses, which brought the headset closer to the face and helped shrink the size. And to address consumers with poorer eyesight, it developed a system where custom prescription lenses can be inserted into the headset over the VR screens, the people said.

This may expose Apple to regulations governing the sale of products with prescriptions. The company typically sells its devices in dozens of countries, many of which have different prescription rules. Apple is also discussing how it would implement prescriptions at the point of sale online and in retail stores.

Apple originally planned to include less powerful processors and offload much of the work to a hub in a user’s home that would wirelessly beam content to the headset. But that idea was squashed by Jony Ive, Apple’s design chief at the time, Bloomberg News reported last year. The headset is designed to work as a standalone device, meaning it can operate on a battery rather than be plugged into a wall or a Mac. That’s similar to Facebook’s latest VR product, while Sony’s requires a PlayStation gaming console.

To further reduce the device’s weight, Apple is planning to use a fabric exterior. That’s a departure from the metal designs Apple uses for most products, though it has used plastic for devices like AirPods, that need to be light, and fabrics for the HomePod speaker to improve acoustics.

Prototypes of the headset, some of which are about the size of an Oculus Quest, include external cameras to enable some AR features. The company is testing using the cameras for hand-tracking and is working on a feature where a user can type virtually in the air to input text. It’s unclear if that function will be ready for the first version of the device or if it will ever leave the exploratory stage.

The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted some development with Apple hardware engineers only being able to work on certain days from the office. The company has also faced delays conducting user testing and data collection. That has slowed some decisions in the engineering process.

The company is also still grappling with what content and functionality it intends to ship with the device. Virtual reality is still a somewhat nascent technology, with content beyond games still relatively limited. Last year, Apple acquired a company called NextVR, which recorded events such as concerts and sports games in virtual reality. It’s also discussed bundling an App Store with the device, which runs on an operating system dubbed “rOS” inside the company.

If Apple goes ahead with the VR headset, it would be a precursor to an eventual pair of AR glasses — a product that the company sees as far more mainstream but also more difficult to launch. Microsoft Corp.’s HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap’s headset, which emphasize AR over VR, retail for $3,500 and $2,295 respectively. HoloLens mostly focuses on work use cases still, while Magic Leap fell well short of the early hype and slashed jobs last year.

Apple first added AR to the iPhone in 2017, allowing new mobile games and apps like those for virtually placing furniture in your living room before buying it. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said both virtual and augmented reality have potential, but that AR is the larger opportunity.

AR glasses must be packed with small, powerful and efficient electronics to overlay notifications, map directions and other information while supporting internet connectivity and strong battery life. That’s a huge technical challenge. Even Oculus, which released its first all-in-one VR headset in 2019, won’t include AR features in its first glasses this year.

Getting to that point requires years of work on lenses, hardware and software, component miniaturization, production techniques and content creation. Critically, getting most people to wear a computer on their face, even a small one, is difficult. That, in part, doomed Google’s early attempt at consumer AR glasses several years ago.

By developing a less mainstream initial headset, Apple can invest in the underlying technologies, consumer education, content development and developer relations to give its eventual AR glasses the best opportunity to be successful — when they are ready.

What Happened: The move comes as part of the Taiwanese supplier's plan to invest $150 million to set up an iPhone production facility in India.

The leased space would be used for Apple-related operations, local government sources told the Financial Express.

In November, Apple put Pegatron on probation over labor violations in mainland China.

Why It Matters: Fellow Taiwanese Apple supplier Wistron’s operations in India were rocked by protesting workers last month.

The violent workers claimed they had been brutally exploited and worked in “sweatshop like conditions.”

Sources told the Financial Express that the Wistron protest would have played a role in the company choosing adjacent Tamil Nadu state for building its facilities.

The state is a large mobile handset manufacturing hub and plays host to Nokia Corporation (NYSE: NOK), Samsung, Lenovo Group Limited (OTC: LNVGY) subsidiary Motorola, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) also known as Foxconn and BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDF) among others.

228,2021-01-20T07:20:00+00:00,MediaTek taps TSMC 6-nanometer tech for new flagship 5G phone chips,"By Stephen Nellis

Jan 20 (Reuters) - MediaTek Inc on Wednesday said it would use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's 6-nanometer chipmaking technology for its newest chips aimed at premium 5G smartphones.

Taiwan's MediaTek appears to be one of the first high-volume customers for the technology and is among a handful of companies with modem technology to connect phones to mobile data networks, competing against Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The new chips announced Wednesday, called Dimensity 1100 and 1200, build on MediaTek's efforts to go after higher-priced handsets where Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips have historically had stronger market share.

Like Qualcomm and Apple, MediaTek designs chips and then contracts out production to outside firms. The newest chips will be made at TSMC, on a chipmaking technology called 6-nanometer. Qualcomm's chips are being made by Samsung on 5-nanometer technology while Apple Inc uses TSMC's 5-nanometer technology.

Smaller chipmaker technology is faster and more power efficient. MediaTek's previous chips used a 7-nanometer process, and moving to newer manufacturing technology along with advances in the chip's design make it 22% faster at computing tasks while consuming 25% less power, Finbarr Moynihan, general manager of international corporate sales, told Reuters in an interview.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

ADAM SHAPIRO: All right, 15 minutes to the closing bell. It looks as if we're going to close-- the indices are going to close in positive territory. The S&P 500 could close up about 1%. And I mention the S&P 500 because our next guest, in one of his notes recently to clients, is saying that over the next 20 years, you can expect a compound increase in the S&P 500 on an average of 7% to 9%.

Let's break this down with Nick Colas. He is the co-founder of DataTrek Research. And your note was very inspiring to me. I'm one of the millions of people who are lazy passive investors. There's a lot of warning that comes with that. But that statistic I just said in your call that over the next 20 years, good news or bad news? What am I missing there, news?

NICHOLAS COLAS: You know, on the good news side, we've never had a 20-year period in the S&P where we've had negative total returns either on a real or nominal basis. So a 20-year horizon is a pretty good one to think about when stocks will always break even or do better for you. So that's the good news, we're north of 0 and should obviously be north of 0 for the next 20 years.

The weird bit is that the returns over 20 years can vary dramatically. And I mean dramatically. Like, it can be as much as 17% a year, which means you're doubling every three, three and 1/2 years. It can be as low as 5%, which we actually just had through 2018 for the prior 20 years. So the returns over the very long term can be wildly different.

And by saying 7% to 9%, we're thinking that we're going to see returns that are pretty good. You are going to double your money every 10 years or so, get two doubles over 20 years. But not as good as what a lot of us remember from, say, 1980 to 1999. That was really the best ever time.

SEANA SMITH: So Nick, with that in mind, how should investors be positioned, then? I guess, what sectors-- I don't think you can name specific names, so what sectors do you expect to outperform, then, at least in the near term?

Story continues

NICHOLAS COLAS: You know, for the near term, and this is talking now three to five years, so near term being not 20, technology still has pride of place, I think, in most people's minds, in our minds about the group that can generate the kind of outsized earnings because of high rates of productivity growth that will generate good returns. Over the next year, just over 2021, we've got to look at more cyclical groups because we all know tech had a fantastic run last year. A lot of the good news is baked in.

And there's not a lot of earnings leverage in the tech sector, really in most cases less than 0, meaning earnings growth is no better than revenue growth. We have to look at financials, industrial, cyclical groups, the stuff in the consumer discretionary except Amazon for the leadership, and that's exactly what we've seen this year. If you look at the S&P year-to-date, all of it, meaning all of it, is due to a little bit of Tesla plus a whole lot of financials and consumer discretionary ex Amazon.

And that's the real tug of war here for the market going through the rest of the year is do we get those cyclical groups to continue to work? I think we do. But that is the subject of debate.

ADAM SHAPIRO: Nick, if I hear you correctly, though, what I'm hearing is that those of us who are passive investors, now may be the time to perhaps consider actively managed investments if we are in that kind of camp, even with the 100 to 200 basis points that we may have to pay or not. Is that what you're actually saying?

NICHOLAS COLAS: That is a great question and the right question to ask. Because let's say you pay 100 basis points of performance, that's 7% to 9% return. We talked about as being realistic over the next 20 years, you're going to give up north of 10% of that return in those active fees. That's a bit of a challenge. This is not a 10% to 15% return market where it's less than 10%.

So you've got to study that calculus very carefully. Are you willing to give up north of 10% of your return to capture some of the upside? And say your active manager gets you 12% instead of 9&, definitely worth it. But you've got to find somebody who you think has the capability of doing that. And it's not as easy as it was back in the late '90s when you're doing 15% to 17% returns, paying 100 bips, not a big deal.

SEANA SMITH: Hey, Nick, the recent action that we've seen in the market, we've seen kind of this push-pull going on. We have the Dow hovering just around 31,000 at this point. What's generating that push-pull action that we've seen in the market lately? Is it all because of stimulus and then worries about COVID? I guess, what are you attributing it to?

NICHOLAS COLAS: Yeah, I think you put your finger on it. Those are the key points. It comes down to how quick we get vaccine rollouts, obviously a big subject of concern. I'm sitting in New York City, and it hasn't been great here.

On the other side, we are looking for more fiscal stimulus. We had presumptive Treasury Secretary Yellen giving testimony today and answering questions. She's clearly in the camp of more sooner is better, which I would agree with. But we don't know exactly what the composition of that's going to be and how tax rates might take a toll on, say, the investor class in terms of what might happen to those.

So it is a real push-pull in terms of how fast will the economy reaccelerate? What sectors are best for that? We talked about financials, industrials versus technology being the safer play. And that's the tug-of-war the market's facing. And it's not easy given the year that we've had to place your bets now in January, given everything that's run so far, so fast.

ADAM SHAPIRO: All right, great to have you here, Nick. Nick Colas is the co-founder of DataTrek Research.

232,2021-01-19T17:40:13+00:00,Microsoft bets on GM’s Cruise while Amazon and others back Rivian amid electric vehicle boom,"It’s another big day in the EV (electric vehicle) and AV (autonomous vehicle) space.

General Motors (GM) announced Tuesday it has entered into a “long-term strategic relationship” with Microsoft (MSFT) focused on GM’s autonomous tech division, Cruise.

Included in the deal is new funding, in which Microsoft will join GM, Honda (HMC) and other institutional investors in a combined new equity raise of more than $2 billion in Cruise, pushing its valuation to $30 billion.

Not to be outdone, electric truckmaker Rivian announced it has raised $2.65 billion from an investor group led by asset managers T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Amazon, through its Climate Pledge Fund. The New York Times and Bloomberg estimate Rivian’s new fundraise values the company at over $27 billion. Ford (F) is also a partner and investor in Rivian.

For the automakers, it makes more and more sense to partner with big technology companies. “Microsoft, as the gold standard in the trustworthy democratization of technology, will be a force multiplier for us as we commercialize our fleet of self-driving, all-electric, shared vehicles,"" Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a statement. DETROIT, MICHIGAN, UNITED STATES - 2019/07/31: People admire a GM Cruise self-driving car on display at the General Motors world headquarters building in Detroit's Renaissance Center. (Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

“As Cruise and GM's preferred cloud, we will apply the power of Azure to help them scale and make autonomous transportation mainstream,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, underscoring Ammann’s sentiments.

For companies like Rivian, that straddle the space between tech and autos, raising money and securing technology partners is a necessary precondition for success. As is competing with the big first mover in the space — Tesla (TSLA).

“The process of creating something like this is anything but simple,” Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe said in an interview with the New York Times. “It’s a complex orchestra, several thousand parts coming from several hundred suppliers. It’s definitely far more complex than people think and far more complex than I thought it would be.”

An electric & autonomous arms race

Prior to today’s deal, Cruise was worth around $18 billion on paper based on its last fundraise. Many analysts on Wall Street and investors surmised GM’s Cruise division was worth a lot more, and today’s announcement is something of a validation. Before Tuesday’s deal, GM owned slightly more than 80% of Cruise, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

Indeed, GM shares soared to a new high last week, and another new high today, based on the company’s push to electrify its vehicles, services, and component infrastructure (batteries, drivetrains, etc.).

A big factor in a lot of these big stock movements, and even bigger valuations, is Tesla. “The massive ramp of Tesla stock and overall valuation is an undeniable factor here,” iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer tells Yahoo Finance. NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES - 2019/04/17: Rivian R1T seen at the New York International Auto Show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York.

Rivian, which is private, has been a darling of the VC community and automotive press, as its highly anticipated electric pickup and SUV near production. The company has taken a more measured approach to fundraising and promoting its products, quietly seeking investment (and not through a public offering or uber-popular SPAC merger) and rolling out updates on its vehicles when there’s something concrete to show.

“We want to launch, demonstrate our capability and let our performance speak for itself before we can look into being public,” Scaringe said.

Though Cruise is a pure AV play and integrated into GM’s EV plans, Rivian also is working on AV tech as well (like Tesla).

The big question is whether upstarts like Rivian, and even established automakers like GM and Ford, can effectively compete with Tesla.

“I think there is a sense that if you're not Tesla, you have to make up for some lost time, and time is money,” Brauer says. “There’s a big investment coming to a lot of these Tesla competitors in order to catch up, to be a player in the space.”

233,2021-01-19T14:45:24+00:00,A Year of Poor Planning Led to Carmakers’ Massive Chip Shortage,"(Bloomberg) -- Near-sighted planning, supply-chain complexities and a tradition of keeping inventories low caused the semiconductor shortage that is now forcing carmakers to idle production lines and straining their relationship with chip manufacturers.

Seeds of the imbroglio were sown almost a year ago as the virus outbreak led to plunging car demand, prompting auto-chip companies to slash orders. But when they wanted to increase supply toward the end of 2020, they struggled to secure capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other contract chipmakers that were busy servicing a boom in demand for gadgets that help housebound consumers stay connected, according to people familiar with the situation.

While publicly assuring the problem is solvable, in private the parties are pointing fingers. Chipmakers say car companies’ preference for low inventories hurt their planning, while auto and part manufacturers say the supply chain is thrown into disarray as semiconductor makers drag their feet. Automakers also contend chipmakers are prioritizing consumer electronics because those devices provide the bulk of their sales and profits. Chipmakers deny they are playing favorites.

The quagmire reveals the risks for automakers from Ford Motor Co. to Volkswagen AG as vehicles become smarter and technologically more complex. Carmakers with more software and chip expertise are set to face a smoother ride, while those whose traditional strength is metal-bending are potentially more prone to supply hiccups.

“Even if the OEMs say they didn’t over-correct, they may not have been thinking far enough ahead,” said Tor Hough, founder of Elm Analytics, a supply-chain research firm based in the Detroit area, referring to automakers, or original equipment manufacturers in industry parlance. “They’re also very wedded to ‘lean manufacturing’ -- so keeping low inventory to be more cost efficient.”

Autos vs. Smartphones

Carmakers don’t deal directly with TSMC and other contract chipmakers. Instead, they work with auto-part suppliers like Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG, which in turn deal with automotive-chip designers including NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG.

Story continues

While those two European chipmakers both make some parts in-house, they outsource a significant portion of production to TSMC and other foundries. It’s difficult for automotive-chip designers to get their orders prioritized by foundries because their volume is dwarfed by their consumer-electronics peers.

Because of carmakers’ “just-in-time” manufacturing model, their suppliers worried about quick inventory buildups and canceled orders originally planned for foundries in the first half of 2020, the people said. At the same time, foundries began seeing a surge in demand for gadget chips after Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Chinese brands prepped an avalanche of 5G devices including the iPhone 12, which require as much as 40% more silicon content as 4G handsets.

One contract chipmaker notified all its customers in the third quarter that it might be time for them to place more orders as it anticipated a rebound in demand, but automotive clients demurred and ended up being the last ones to seek more capacity, one of the people said.

Appeal to Governments

TSMC’s automotive customers continued to decrease demand in the third quarter, and the chipmaker only began to see sudden recovery in automotive orders in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said in an earnings call earlier this month. By contrast, makers of consumer electronics and other hardware quickly built up chip inventories above the usual seasonal level, and are continuing to do so as they fret about potential future supply disruptions.

The shortage has been exacerbated by a lack of capacity at assemblers including ASE Technology Holding Co., a person familiar with the matter said. Chip assemblers like ASE represent the critical final stage in finishing and preparing a chip for use, but the company’s production expansion has been hindered by an equipment supplier’s tardiness in delivering new gear, the person said. A further squeeze to the global supply was caused by the Trump administration blacklisting China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December.

Once European and U.S. carmakers realized they had a problem, they appealed to officials in Taiwan, home to TSMC and other leading foundries including United Microelectronics Corp., for assistance in stabilizing their chip supply.

The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents major U.S. car companies, sought out the Taiwanese government for help, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition, General Motors Co. spoke to Taiwanese officials, and got them to help relay its request to TSMC, Bloomberg News has reported. The European Union has approached Taipei about the same issue, and Volkswagen has separately reached out as well, according to a person familiar with the matter.

“We have requested that the U.S. government help us find a solution to the problem because it will diminish our production and have a negative impact on the U.S. economy until it’s resolved,” Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in an interview.

Scaling Back Output

Because chip production requires a lead time of about three months, the impact will last throughout the first half and could bleed into the third quarter, Blunt said. His organization is working with the Biden administration on the issue, he said.

Ford, Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., VW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV -- now a part of Stellantis NV -- are among global carmakers that have scaled back output due to a lack of chips required for a wide range of components, from brakes to windshield wipers.

With vehicles adding entertainment and autonomous-driving features, the amount of chips required is increasing and the supply chain becoming more complex. A car from a premium brand can require more than 3,000 chips, and even if just one is missing, the vehicle won’t get completed.

“There are more chips, more varieties of chips. It’s not one batch of chips that went bad and they’re struggling with recovering that one chip,” said Hough at Elm Analytics. “The ecosystem upstream of the OEMs stopped purchasing the chips they used in production as the manufacturing went down.”Another bottleneck lies with smaller automotive-chip designers which supply critical chips to the whole industry and depend entirely on foundries. They often lack bargaining power to secure timely production because of their modest sizes.

While automotive supply-chain managers are adept at containing short-term crises like the explosion in the northern Chinese port of Tianjin in 2015, they tend to be slower in making bigger changes that would help them deal with potential long-term disruptions, Elm Analytics’ Hough said.

Foundry Spending Surge

Bosch, the German car-parts maker, said its chips supply has been significantly diminished because a chipmaker’s expansion and production increases were delayed by the pandemic. In an emailed statement, Bosch said it is in daily contact with suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact.

The shortage may start to ease as TSMC boosts its spending to a staggering $28 billion for 2021, with the foundry pledging this month that automotive chips will be a priority. The company has begun to offer more capacity in recent days to at least one automotive chip designer, although the volume still isn’t enough to satisfy demand, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The situation isn’t as devastating as last spring’s car-plant shutdown that spanned the globe, said Sig Huber, a consultant at Conway MacKenzie and a former head of purchasing at Fiat Chrysler.

“This will be more sporadic, a plant here or a plant there, for a shorter period of time, as opposed to a full industry shutdown,” Huber said. “This will not have anywhere near the impact of the production losses we saw last year.”

235,2021-01-18T17:02:09+00:00,Sequoia Said to Invest in Auto1 at $7.2 Billion Value Before IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Sequoia Capital agreed to invest in Auto1 Group SE at a valuation of about 6 billion euros ($7.2 billion) ahead of the German online car-trading platform’s initial public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said.

The U.S. venture capital firm and rival fund Lone Pine Capital reached a preliminary deal to each buy about 50 million euros of Auto1stock from early investor DN Capital, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. They have agreed to a lock-up period of six months, the people said.

Sequoia and Lone Pine also signaled plans to invest at least 50 million euros apiece in Auto1’s imminent IPO, the people said.

The move marks a vote of confidence in Auto1, which is backed by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., and the business of buying and selling cars online. Auto1 said last week it aims to raise about 1 billion euros from a Frankfurt share sale in the first quarter.

A spokesperson for Auto1 declined to comment. An official at DN Capital didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, while representatives for Sequoia and Lone Pine couldn’t immediately be reached during a U.S. public holiday.

DN Capital became one of Auto1’s first backers when it invested in the company in 2013, the year after the German startup was founded, according to its website. The venture capital firm previously invested in app developer Shazam Entertainment Ltd., which created a music-identification service later bought by Apple Inc. It also helped fund U.K. online realtor Purplebricks Group Plc and international money transfer service Remitly Inc.

Video Transcript

- You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it, I was on the board at the time of DirecTV, they bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion. So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem, that we have [? won, ?] by the way.

So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner, or the Warner, I should say, content that they bought I think was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

- And then Fox and Disney.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big.

So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized you need more scale both at the content and as well as the distribution level. So when he identified the fact that there wasn't much for him to buy to, and again, this is my humble opinion, and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. He's doing all right.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/haim-saban-explains-why-fox-142106581.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'CCERX.US', 'CMCSA.US', 'DIS.US', 'FB.US', 'FOX.US', 'FOXA.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IWM.US', 'NFLX.US', 'SBGI.US', 'SNAP.US', 'SPY.US', 'T-PA.US', 'T-PC.US', 'T.US', 'TMUS.US', 'TPCO.US', 'TWTR.US']","['DISNEY', 'TIME WARNER']","{'polarity': 0.978, 'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.099}"
238,2021-01-15T20:02:38+00:00,"Going on a Tear Once Again, Tread Carefully With Canoo Stock","Pulling back at the start of 2021, Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) stock is bouncing back in a big way. As of this writing, shares are up 30.4% in the pre-market. Why are investors diving back into this SPAC (special purpose acquisition company), which completed its merger with privately-held electric vehicle maker Canoo late last year? GOEV stock

Source: Canoo media

Chalk it up to a news the company held partnership talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the first half of 2020. As you may know, the big tech powerhouse is throwing its hat into the EV ring.

Given that this is something that happened months ago, there may not be much more to the story. This company hasn’t commented on its prior talks. And, it’s possible Apple has gone in another direction.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But, even if the company doesn’t ink a deal with the tech giant, the rally in Canoo stock could continue. Shares could continue to climb, as the EV bubble remains fully in motion.

9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon

So, what does that mean for investors a little late to the party? There’s possible upside from here, but tread carefully. Shares were changing hands for $12.50 per share as recently as Jan 4. A pullback back to this price level could happen if enthusiasm takes a breather.

GOEV Stock and Partnership Deals

There may not be much meat to the above-mentioned news of last year’s partnership talks with Apple. But, the Silicon Valley behemoth isn’t the only high-profile name looking to work with this upstart.

Canoo already has an existing partnership with Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF), which was also an early investor in the company. Which, given recent news Hyundai is in talks with Apple about an EV partnership, makes things all the more interesting.

Outside of the whole possible Apple-Hyundai web, there’s also been reports the company will enter a contract manufacturing deal with Magna International (NYSE:MGA). The auto parts giant has been active in partnering with other early-stage EV makers. As you may know, Magna last year inked a similar deal with Fisker (NYSE:FSR), another popular electric vehicle play.

Story continues

In short, the company has plenty of possible partnership deals in the works. But, it’s still uncertain whether the headline-making news will result in an actual deal (which could put more points into GOEV stock). Or, if it winds up moving in a different direction.

Excitement over the Apple talks could fade. But, even if Canoo falls back from here, there are other reasons that make this unique EV upstart an interesting investment opportunity.

Could the Unique Business Model be its Path to Profits?

With so many EV companies going public via SPACs, it’s tough to differentiate them. Sure, each one differs in the details. But, by-and-large, upstarts like Fisker are employing a strategy similar to that of established players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

However, this one is taking a more unique approach. As InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake wrote Jan. 11, Canoo is offering its vehicles on a subscription-only basis. At first, this sounds like a traditional auto lease. But, based on the details (no lease term, no down payment), it’s more like applying the SaaS model to vehicles.

Given this revenue model’s higher gross margins, I agree this sounds like a surefire way to quickly scale up to profitability. But, while it sounds good on paper, I am skeptical whether it will play out well in real life.

Sure, millennials and others looking for the cache of driving an EV, but lack the money to buy a Tesla, may be eager to sign up. But, will U.S. households be willing to participate in an arrangement that requires little upfront commitment, but long-term is a much more expensive way to have access to a car?

Only time will tell whether this unique business model pays off. Like with other newly-public EV names, the company touts ambitious financial projections for later in the decade. And some analysts, like Roth Capital’s Craig Irwin, see sales soaring to $1.4 billion by 2024. Rating shares a “buy,” Irwin’s price target for GOEV stock is $30 per share.

Further Near-Term Gains Possible, But Tread Carefully

Canoo remains a high-risk opportunity, given it’s speculation fueling its recent price moves. But, that doesn’t mean shares will pull back in the near term. And, not only due to the possible partnerships in the pipeline. With continued enthusiasm for EV stocks, this stock (currently at $22 per share) could head toward the $30 per share price level in the near-term.

But, be careful. The renewed interest in GOEV stock could fast reverse course, if recent rumors fail to produce actual game-changing news. Tread carefully, but this definitely remains an EV stock to keep on your radar.

239,2021-01-15T14:12:06+00:00,Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan could wreck Wall Street's favorite money-making trade,"President-elect Joe Biden’s extensive $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may supercharge economic growth, but also send Wall Street’s favorite five tech stocks known as FAANG into a short-term price slumber.

While naturally Biden’s fiscal relief won’t be causing quarterly earnings misses at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google, his plan could dent market psychology on the stocks and in turn what multiple investors are willing to pay on each.

The line of thinking is rather straightforward to astute market watchers.

Biden’s stimulus package could send investors rushing into more cyclical stocks in the retail, energy and materials space in advance of strong lifts to the respective sector earnings growth rates. Those funds may come from cashing out of FAANG stocks, which gained an average 43% (versus a 27% rise in the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund) over the past year fueled by views on the Street of Big Tech being economic safe havens.

Interestingly, this dynamic may already be playing out. Shares of the FAANG stocks are all slightly lower (Netflix the worst performer, is down 6.1%) year-to-date compared to the 1.1% gain for the S&P 500.

Supporting the possible rotation would be Wall Street analysts moving quickly to push up profit estimates on cyclical areas of the market. Looked at another way, investors would be positioning for faster earnings growth this year and next out of cyclicals relative to FAANG stocks because of the latest stimulus package.

“The spending comes at an interesting junction for analysts and investors as it will no doubt mean further EPS upgrades. It will also mean that many early cycle S&P 500 sectors will see faster earnings revisions than the popular FAANG+ and IT which dominated investor attention in 2020,” points out Jefferies strategist Sean Darby.

Not even 24-hours after Biden released his economic revival plan, Wall Street has already laid the groundwork for the unwind of the FAANG long trade.

Darby says his economic team at Jefferies lifted its 2021 U.S. GDP target to 6.4% from 5.25% after the release of Biden’s proposal. Jefferies analysts also raised their price targets and EPS estimates on their industrial coverage, Darby says.

The immediate tone is similar at Goldman Sachs.

“We do not expect all of the elements of the proposal to pass, but we are increasing our assumption of additional near-term fiscal measures from $750 billion (3.4% of GDP) to $1.1 trillion (5% of GDP),” Goldman’s Chief Economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a flash note to clients.

Not everyone on the Street is ready to toss in the towel on FAANG stocks, however.

Bulls argue that with the pandemic continuing to rage on and putting the economic recovery at risk no matter of a fresh stimulus injection, FAANG remains the best place to be. Companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google offer strong business models and growth prospects for the foreseeable future — and any dips in their stock prices should be bought, say the bulls.

“The FAANG names all have Josh Allen-like [Buffalo Bills quarterback] tailwinds, Biden is just evening the playing field for industrial, manufacturing, and small businesses on the other side of this dark chapter of growth,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says. “We view Biden plan as bullish for the market and our view is tech stocks still have another 25%+ upside for 2021.”

No doubt though the winds are starting to blow in the direction of the cyclical on the FAANG off-trade.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, ""Oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.""

HAIM SABAN: I say baloney. You know, he's-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters maybe he's a little bit left of me. But he's more of a centrist than a left wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who was able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal. And I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again there are so many avenues that you can take to address that inequality. But I am truly, in my heart of hearts 100% convinced that he's the right man to address that inequality. He is a guy with a heart. We miss heart over the last four years. We [? were ?] [? all ?] [? served ?] by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us one way or the other.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/biden-man-address-inequality-democratic-110000293.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'CMCSA.US', 'DIS.US', 'FB.US', 'FOX.US', 'FOXA.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'NFLX.US', 'SBGI.US', 'SNAP.US', 'SPXL.US', 'SPXS.US', 'SPXU.US', 'T-PA.US', 'T-PC.US', 'T.US', 'TMUS.US', 'TPCO.US']","['ANDY SERWER', 'PRESIDENT-ELECT']","{'polarity': 0.976, 'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.103}"
242,2021-01-15T09:56:37+00:00,U.S. Blacklists Xiaomi in Widening Assault on China Tech,"(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp. plunged a record 10% after the Trump administration blacklisted China’s No. 2 smartphone maker and 10 other companies, broadening efforts to undercut the expansion of the country’s technology sector.

The U.S. has targeted scores of Chinese companies for the stated purpose of protecting national security, but going after Xiaomi was unexpected. The Beijing-based company has been viewed as China’s answer to Apple Inc., producing sleek smartphones that draw loyal fans with each new release. The company, which vies with Huawei Technologies Co. for the title of China’s No. 1 mobile device brand, also makes electric scooters, earphones and smart rice cookers.

The news was “really surprising to me,” said Kevin Chen, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Merchants Securities Co.

The U.S. Defense Dept. identified Xiaomi as one of nine companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military -- which means American investors will be prohibited from buying their securities and will have to divest holdings by November.

Other firms targeted include Luokong Technology Corp., Gowin Semiconductor Corp., Global Tone Communication Technology Co. and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. Index stalwarts such as China’s three biggest telecom firms are already on the list.

Xiaomi said in a statement it is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, adding that it would take appropriate actions to protect its interests.

Unless the ban is reversed, the smartphone maker risks being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes. China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. were removed by MSCI Inc. last week.

The Trump administration’s blacklistings have focused on Chinese companies with military ties and strategic value to the industry’s growth. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China’s largest chipmaker and critical to the country’s ability to build a self-sufficient tech industry, was included in December.

Story continues

Xiaomi was co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Lei Jun about 10 years ago, with U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. as one of the earliest investors. It’s since expanded well beyond China’s borders, particularly into Europe and India, becoming one of the country’s more recognizable brands. It surpassed Apple in global smartphone sales in the third quarter, according to the International Data Corporation, and joined Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index in September.

The move sent Xiaomi suppliers south on Friday: FIH Mobile Ltd., which helps it assemble smartphones, plunged almost 14% after a strong rally in recent days. Component suppliers including Largan Precision Co., Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. and AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. also fell. Spreads on Xiaomi’s dollar bonds widened as much as 60 basis points Friday, according to credit traders.

Separately, the U.S. Commerce Dept. blacklisted China’s No. 3 oil company, China National Offshore Oil Corp., and Skyrizon, which develops military equipment. The Commerce designation is more severe and prohibits American firms from supplying those entities.

Investors may be concerned that Xiaomi could be targeted by Commerce in the future, after the Defense Dept.’s move. Huawei was forced to sell off its Honor smartphone business after it was cut off from American suppliers, including Android-developer Google.

“The risk looks high” that Xiaomi could get added to the broader Entity List, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote Friday. That “would significantly impact its ability to procure components to make smartphones.”

Trump’s increasingly aggressive stance towards Chinese corporations has provoked Beijing, which views the litany of U.S. actions as a threat. The government this month issued new rules to protect its firms from “unjustified” foreign laws and previously talked about creating its own Unreliable Entities list, though no concrete retaliation has emerged.

Despite Friday’s selloff, some investors held out hope that the incoming U.S. administration will reverse actions taken in the twilight days of Donald Trump’s presidency.

“This is not going to be a priority for the Biden administration. This ruling will be reversed before November, so we are going to hold, and not just hold but be a buyer on this weakness,” Vanessa Martinez, a partner at Lerner Group, told Bloomberg TV. “This is just like that last parting shot against China by the Trump administration.”

Chen of China Merchants Securities also argued the fallout for Xiaomi may be limited.

“Many investors would choose to lock in profit since the stock rallied a lot in the past year,” he said. “But I think the impact on Xiaomi would be more sentimental than fundamental. These declines could be short-lived.”

244,2021-01-15T09:13:37+00:00,"U.S. Targets Xiaomi, Cnooc in Trump’s Late Anti-China Push","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration blacklisted Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi Corp. for alleged military links along with the country’s third-biggest oil company over its drilling in the South China Sea, part of a final push to ratchet up pressure on Beijing before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

Xiaomi was one of nine firms added to the Defense Department’s list of Chinese military companies, a move that will restrict U.S. investments in its securities. Other firms include state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which is central to China’s goal of creating a narrow-body plane that can compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department’s move against China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation’s main deepwater explorer, denies it access to U.S. technologies without specific permission. It follows a December decision to blacklist more than 60 other Chinese companies.

“This measure by the Trump administration once again demonstrates to the public, to the international community, what is unilateralism, double standards and bullying,” China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing on Friday. “The Chinese side will take necessary measures to ensure the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies, and we will stand by our companies, to protect, to uphold their rights and interests in accordance with law.”

Spokespeople for Xiaomi, Cnooc and Comac had no immediate comment. China National Aviation, named on the Pentagon list, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new raft of curbs mark a late push by President Donald Trump to ensure his pressure campaign against China stays in place long after he leaves office next week. While Biden and many Democrats say they oppose Trump’s tactics on China, the restrictions will give the new president increased leverage over Beijing when his team negotiates on trade with leaders of the world’s second-largest economy.

Biden’s Pledge

Biden has pledged to work with allies to develop a more coherent strategy against China, though it’s not clear whether there’ll be any immediate shifts in policy. Under an executive order signed by Trump last year targeting what it calls China’s abusive business practices, U.S. investors will need to unwind stakes in designated companies by November.

Xiaomi surpassed Apple Inc. in smartphone sales in the third quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. It joined Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index in September after grabbing market share from Huawei Technologies Co. as U.S. sanctions on Huawei deepened.

Unless the ban against Xiaomi is reversed, the smartphone maker risks being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes. China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. were removed by MSCI Inc. last week, while S&P Dow Jones Indices will drop Cnooc from its gauges next month.

Xiaomi shares closed 10% lower in Hong Kong, while its suppliers also tumbled. FIH Mobile Ltd., which helps it assemble smartphones, plunged 14%. Component suppliers including Largan Precision Co., Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. and AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. also fell. Spreads on Xiaomi’s dollar bonds widened as much as 40 basis points Friday morning, according to credit traders.

Cnooc’s listed unit, Cnooc Ltd., fell 1.1% in Hong Kong. Cnooc is the smallest of China’s so-called big three state-owned oil majors after China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp., also known as Sinopec. The company’s operations in the South China Sea have proved controversial with neighbors because China claims drilling rights in waters far from its borders, and within 200 miles of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.

“China’s reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to U.S. national security,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “Cnooc acts as a bully for the People’s Liberation Army to intimidate China’s neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes.”

The Lists

The Trump administration has now listed 44 Chinese companies effectively owned by the People’s Liberation Army under a 1999 law, which authorizes the president to potentially impose sanctions on them. Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices.

The Department of Commerce’s blacklist, which was created last year to highlight restrictions on more than 100 businesses connected to China, Venezuela and Russia, is more severe and prohibits American firms from supplying those entities without a license.

It was not immediately clear why Cnooc had been added now after it was not included in earlier listings. The ban also doesn’t apply to sales of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and also wouldn’t affect joint ventures between Cnooc and Western companies, a senior administration official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, told reporters in a briefing Thursday.

Subsidiaries of Cnooc have stakes in two U.S. shale oil and gas projects, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. The company also has interests in two offshore projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which are being developed alongside partners including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Hess Corp.

Other Applications

Various components used in oil drilling can also have military applications, making it unsurprising that Cnooc had been targeted, said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s a hassle for Cnooc, but China has its own oil service industry and offshore industry. It’s probably not as devastating as a company that would lose access to microchips,” she said.

Cnooc has been at the center of territorial disputes since 2012, when it invited foreign drillers to explore blocks off Vietnam that Hanoi’s leaders had already awarded to companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO Gazprom.

Aerospace company Comac, key to China’s ambitions to deliver locally-made jets to domestic and foreign carriers, relies on U.S. suppliers for about 60% of parts for its C919 passenger aircraft.

The Commerce Department also added Skyrizon to the military end-user list, saying it poses a threat to national security. Ross said the company’s push to acquire and “indigenize” foreign military technologies posed a significant threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Skyrizon was unable to be reached for comment.

“This action serves to warn the export community of Skyrizon’s significant ties to the People’s Liberation Army,” Ross said.

Cnooc is the smallest of China’s so-called big three state-owned oil majors after China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp., also known as Sinopec. The company’s operations in the South China Sea have proved controversial with neighbors because China claims drilling rights in waters far from its borders, and within 200 miles of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.

“China’s reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to U.S. national security,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “Cnooc acts as a bully for the People’s Liberation Army to intimidate China’s neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes.”

The Lists

The Trump administration has now listed 44 Chinese companies effectively owned by the People’s Liberation Army under a 1999 law, which authorizes the president to potentially impose sanctions on them. Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices.

The Department of Commerce’s blacklist, which was created last year to highlight restrictions on more than 100 businesses connected to China, Venezuela and Russia, is more severe and prohibits American firms from supplying those entities without a license.

It was not immediately clear why Cnooc had been added now after it was not included in earlier listings. The ban also doesn’t apply to sales of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and also wouldn’t affect joint ventures between Cnooc and Western companies, a senior administration official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, told reporters in a briefing Thursday.

Subsidiaries of Cnooc have stakes in two U.S. shale oil and gas projects, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. The company also has interests in two offshore projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which are being developed alongside partners including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Hess Corp.

Other Applications

Various components used in oil drilling can also have military applications, making it unsurprising that Cnooc had been targeted, said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow for energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s a hassle for Cnooc, but China has its own oil service industry and offshore industry. It’s probably not as devastating as a company that would lose access to microchips,” she said.

Cnooc has been at the center of territorial disputes since 2012, when it invited foreign drillers to explore blocks off Vietnam that Hanoi’s leaders had already awarded to companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO Gazprom.

Aerospace company Comac, key to China’s ambitions to deliver locally-made jets to domestic and foreign carriers, relies on U.S. suppliers for about 60% of parts for its C919 passenger aircraft.

The Commerce Department also added Skyrizon to the military end-user list, saying it poses a threat to national security. Ross said the company’s push to acquire and “indigenize” foreign military technologies posed a significant threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Skyrizon was unable to be reached for comment.

“This action serves to warn the export community of Skyrizon’s significant ties to the People’s Liberation Army,” Ross said.

246,2021-01-15T08:36:23+00:00,"Trump Administration Adds Xiaomi, Cnoonc To List Of Blacklisted Chinese Firms In Last Days of Office","The outgoing President Donald Trump’s administration continues to add pressure on China even as its term nears an end. In the latest move, U.S. has added China’s leading smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (OTC: XIACF) and its third-biggest driller CNOOC Ltd (NYSE: CEO) to blacklisted firms — baning them from American investment due to ties with the Chinese military, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

What Happened: Xiaomi was added to the Department of Defense (DoD) list of nine companies for alleged military ties. “The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities,” DoD said in a statement.

Companies in the DoD list are prohibited from American exchanges and investment. As per the administration’s amended order, investors have a November 2021 deadline to sell sanctioned securities.

Cnooc was added to the Department of Commerce (DoC) list — which denies access to U.S. technologies for the driller without specific permission. Bloomberg noted that the list is under an order issued in December that has blacklisted more than 60 companies.

“China’s reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to U.S. national security and the security of the international community,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a press release.

""Cnooc acts as a bully for the People’s Liberation Army to intimidate China’s neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes.”

Why It Matters: Xiaomi’s stock crashed 10% in Hong Kong on the news. The company hit back by saying “it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use.""

""The Company confirms that it is not owned, controlled, or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a ‘Communist Chinese Military Company’ defined under the NDAA,” Xiaomi said in a statement, as per CNBC.

Xiaomi is the third-largest smartphone maker globally, and this move could have future implications, CNBC notes. The smartphone has not been put on the “Entity List,” which bans sanctioned companies from using American technology. Xiaomi uses chips from QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM).

As per the Bloomberg report, the move against Xiaomi was unexpected, which is viewed as China’s answer to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Unless the ban is reversed, Xiaomi risks being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes.

So far, the government has left three major companies — Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY), and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU) off the ban list considering the potential economic impact.

Price Action: XIACF closed 9.35% lower at $3.88 on Thursday, and CEO closed 5.02% higher at $102.71.

247,2021-01-15T04:25:17+00:00,Chipmaking Tool Supplier Expects Demand Boom to Last Years,"(Bloomberg) -- The global shortage for chips that’s shut down factory lines and fueled waiting lists for the hottest consumer electronics is showing no signs of abating and that’s good news for specialist suppliers like Tokyo Electron Ltd.

The provider of semiconductor fabrication tools expects orders from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to rise for years to come as those companies scale up their production to sate booming demand.

“Demand is overwhelming as the supply of various components is going to tighten toward this year’s end and more investment to increase manufacturing capacity is likely,” Chief Executive Officer Toshiki Kawai said in an interview with Bloomberg News. His remarks came ahead of TSMC announcing it’s raised its capital expenditure to more than $25 billion this year, helping push up Tokyo Electron’s share price by as much as 5.7% on Friday to a record high.

TSMC and Samsung are the leaders in adopting extreme ultraviolet lithography, the most advanced fabrication method that lets them reach smaller geometries like 5nm today and 3nm in 2022, unlocking more powerful and efficient chips. Tokyo Electron commands 100% of the business for photoresist coaters and developers used in factories deploying EUV technology, according to its CEO, so every new EUV machine that goes online adds to its bottom line.

“I can confidently say there’s no cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturer in the world that has no Tokyo Electron machineries in their lines,” Kawai said. “More factory investment means more business for us.”

The automotive industry, which had been among the hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, is showing signs of recovery, which have translated into a widespread chip shortage as smartphone makers like Apple Inc. and Samsung’s consumer division were already raising their orders. More advanced phones with 5G wireless technology require even more silicon, and capacitor supplier Murata Manufacturing Co. anticipates 500 million of those devices in the coming fiscal year.

Intel Corp., the longtime leader in silicon technology, has also been in talks with TSMC and Samsung about outsourcing some of its business, adding to the urgency of investment and capacity expansion. Samsung has committed in excess of $100 billion over a decade to develop its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and keep up with its Taiwanese rival.

Kazuyoshi Saito, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities, said Tokyo Electron’s tools for EUV lines require extremely precise manufacturing to shut out any dust, making these EUV-compatible machines expensive.

“More adoption of the EUV technology benefits Tokyo Electron in terms of volumes and unit prices,” he said.

Tokyo Electron’s Kawai said demand for the company’s products has long been on the rise due to an expected boom of 5G smartphones and autonomous driving, but the Covid-19 pandemic ignited demand elsewhere, including logistics, retail and drug discovery.

“Our industry has become essential to people’s lives because all industries that serve those needs now require semiconductor chips to advance,” he said.

SEMI, a U.S.-based industry association, estimated global sales of semiconductor equipment to have grown 16% in 2020 from a year ago to a record $68.9 billion and the figure is expected to rise again to $71.9 billion this year. Tokyo Electron projects its revenue will hit 2 trillion yen ($19.3 billion) in the fiscal year ending in March 2024 from 1.13 trillion yen in the year ended in March 2020.

One possible disruption to Tokyo Electron’s momentum could come from ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, with several Chinese companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. now subject to sanctions and bans. Kawai said customers in China are as important as those in other regions, though his company will adhere to rules and restrictions set by the U.S. government.

“We won’t provide our products to customers that the U.S. manufacturers can’t, because that would be a risk for us if we do,” he said.

249,2021-01-15T01:30:03+00:00,TSMC’s $28 Billion Spending Blitz Ignites a Global Chip Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. triggered a global chip stock rally after outlining plans to pour as much as $28 billion into capital spending this year, a staggering sum aimed at expanding its technological lead and constructing a plant in Arizona to serve key American customers.

The envisioned spending spree sent chipmaking gear manufacturers surging from New York to Tokyo. Capital spending for 2021 is targeted at $25 billion to $28 billion, compared with $17.2 billion the previous year. About 80% of the outlay will be devoted to advanced processor technologies, suggesting TSMC anticipates a surge in business for cutting-edge chipmaking. Analysts expect Intel Corp., the world’s best-known chipmaker, to outsource manufacture to the likes of TSMC after a series of inhouse technology slip-ups.

The sheer scale of TSMC’s envisioned budget -- more than half its projected revenue for the year -- underscores TSMC’s determination to maintain its dominance and supply its biggest American clients from Apple Inc. to Qualcomm Inc. At 52% of projected 2021 revenue, the chipmaker’s planned spending would be the sixth-highest among all companies with a value of more than $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlay may also ramp up pressure on Intel, whose budget for 2020 was roughly $14.5 billion.

“The high capex guide is indicative of TSMC’s confidence in Intel’s outsourcing business,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “TSMC’s track record also shows high capex always subsequently led to high growth.”

The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects revenue of $12.7 billion to $13 billion this quarter, ahead of the $12.4 billion average of analyst estimates. That will power mid-teens sales growth this year, though that’s roughly half the pace of the increase in 2020.

Net income in the quarter ended December climbed 23% to NT$142.8 billion ($5.1 billion), compared with the NT$137.2 billion average of analyst estimates, the chipmaker said Thursday. That contributed to a 50% increase in full-year profit, the speediest rate of expansion since 2010. Sales in the December quarter climbed 14% to a record NT$361.5 billion, according to previously disclosed monthly numbers, helped in part by robust demand for Apple’s new 5G iPhones.

TSMC jumped as much as 5.6%, the most since July, to an all-time high in early Friday trade, extending a rally of more than 70% over the past year. Supplier Tokyo Electron Ltd. climbed more than 4%, while ASML Holding NV rose 5.9% on Thursday. Other semiconductor companies in the U.S. rallied on Thursday, with Applied Materials Inc. gaining almost 8% and Lam Research Corp up 6% in New York. Intel gained 4%.

The fourth-quarter results revealed increasing contributions from TSMC’s most-advanced 5-nanometer process technology -- used to make Apple’s A14 chips. That accounted for about 20% of total revenue during the quarter, more than doubling its share from the previous three months, while 7nm represented 29%. By business segment, TSMC’s smartphone business contributed about 51% to revenue, while high-performance computing (HPC) was at 31%.

As rivals like United Microelectronics Corp. fall behind and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. struggles with American sanctions, TSMC’s pivotal role is likely to expand in 2021. The company has been racing to meet demand from larger-volume electronics clients, exacerbating a severe shortage of automotive chips that’s forcing firms like Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to curtail production.

TSMC said the automotive industry had been “soft” since 2018 and demand only started to recover in the fourth quarter. The company is working with its automotive customers to address the capacity supply issues, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said, though he didn’t elaborate when the bottlenecks that forced carmakers to cut production could be resolved.

Executives didn’t address reports about potential orders from Intel on Thursday, saying that they don’t discuss specific customers. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker held talks with TSMC about making some of its best chips, people familiar have said, though it’s unclear whether the company may pivot after the appointment of Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO.

“We believe Intel would not change its plans of CPU foundry outsourcing even with the CEO change,” Citigroup analysts wrote in a note, citing the time and costs associated with process qualification as well as the risk that U.S. chipmaker won’t get capacity from TSMC if it doesn’t book ahead. “In our view, Intel will be one of the major customers to first adopt 3nm for production. TSMC might start shipping 3nm wafers to Intel from early 3Q22.”

Construction on a planned $12 billion plant in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona will begin this year, executives reiterated, without specifying how much of the planned budget for this year will be allocated to the project. The factory will be completed by 2024, with initial target output of 20,000 wafers per month, though the company envisions having a “mega scale production site” over the long term, Chairman Mark Liu said.

Even as TSMC grows, foundries such as TSMC, UMC and Globalfoundries Inc. aren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also Xboxes and PlayStations and even certain iPhones. TSMC is by far the most advanced of the foundries responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors, serving the likes of Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors NV, which also supply the mobile and auto industries.

What Bloomberg Industries Says:

TSMC’s $28 billion capital investment target for 2021 is 50% more than investors expected, and amounts to management’s strong vote of confidence in demand for smartphones and high-performance computing (HPC) chips over the next three years. The capital outlay target implies 2021 sales could leap to $56 billion, 4% higher than the $54 billion consensus expects, assuming 50% capital spending intensity.

251,2021-01-15T00:24:01+00:00,Xiaomi Shares Plunge More Than 12% Over Inclusion on U.S. Blacklist,"By Gina Lee

Investing.com – Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corporation saw its shares plunge after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration added it to a blacklist of Chinese companies with ties to the military.

Xiaomi Corp (HK:1810) plunged 12.40% to HK$28.60 ($3.69) by 12:21 AM ET (5:21 AM GMT).

The company was one of nine added to the Defense Department’s blacklist, in a final move to ratchet up pressure on China before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. State-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, Luokong Technology Corp., Gowin Semiconductor Corp., Global Tone Communication Technology Co. and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. were also among the nine to make it onto the list.

Under an executive order signed by Trump in November 2020, U.S. investors will have to unwind stakes in any company on the Defense Department list by Nov. 11, 2021.

“Ample warning has been given to the public about the material risks associated with investments” identified in Trump’s executive order, State Department’s undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment Keith Krach said on Thursday.

A Xiaomi statement said that it is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, adding that it would take appropriate actions to protect its interests. However, the company faces being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deletion from global benchmark indexes unless it is removed from the blacklist.

China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. were all removed by MSCI Inc. during the previous week thanks to their inclusion on the list.

Co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Lei Jun, Beijing-based Xiaomi is one of China’s more recognizable brands. Viewed as China’s answer to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., it makes electric scooters, earphones and smart rice cookers alongside its flagship smartphones. It competes with Huawei Technologies Co. for the title of China’s No. 1 mobile device brand and took grabbed market share from Huawei as U.S. sanctions on Huawei also deepened.

Story continues

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department added China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)), the country’s main deepwater explorer, to its own blacklist. The move follows the decision to blacklist more than 60 other Chinese companies in December 2020.

The reason for CNOOC’s inclusion in the list is its operations in the South China Sea. China’s claim of drilling rights in the area have soured relations with other countries laying claim to the body of water, including Vietnam and the Philppines.

253,2021-01-14T19:58:39+00:00,"Tesla stock is 'very fully priced,' says investing legend Byron Wien","Blackstone’s Byron Wien has made his legendary career on Wall Street by capitalizing on mispriced opportunities in the market using tried and true fundamental stock analysis.

And on that score, the vice chairman of Blackstone’s private wealth solutions group thinks shares of Tesla (TSLA) right now sport the valuation that accurately reflects the company’s future potential. “I think Tesla is very fully priced,” Wien told Yahoo Finance Live. “The question is how long will it take them to sell enough cars to justify their present market value?”

Tesla fanatics continue to wager aggressively on just that very question.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker have come out of the gate blasting in 2021, up a cool 20.1%. The advance has brought the one-year gain on Tesla’s stock to an eye-popping 708%. By comparison the S&P 500 — which Tesla joined on Dec. 21 after several quarters of profits — is up marginally in 2021.

In the process of the stock’s latest run-up, CEO Elon Musk became the world’s richest person on Jan. 7. At a market cap of $805 billion, Tesla is now valued at more than Facebook at $708 billion — despite the latter’s more predictable business and history of solid profits. The combined market caps of Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler stands at $246 billion, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.

Even with Tesla’s stratospheric valuation (as Wien hints at) built on stratospheric expectations for the future of electric and autonomous cars, the Wall Street bulls on Tesla remain well-entrenched.

“Overall we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with Giga 3,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

Ives has a bull case price target of $1,000 on Tesla’s stock, or 25% above current levels.

Meanwhile, the stock’s melt-up has begun to attract a legion of Tesla doubters into the bull camp. The stock has caught several upgrades this year, only serving to fuel the speculative fervor.

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy recently marked up his price target on Tesla’s stock by $400 to $800. He says the upgrade reflects a company that has proven adept at raising capital, boosting margins and managing investor expectations.

Over at RBC Capital Markets, long-time Tesla bear Joseph Spak conceded this month he has been “completely wrong” on the stock. Spak hiked his rating on Tesla shares to Sector Perform and boosted the price target to $700 from $339.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Instead of shrinking from the world after he made his billions, media mogul Haim Saban jumped into the fray. The Democratic mega-donor has poured tens of millions into electing the party's candidates, becoming a top power broker with a special focus on policy towards Israel. Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the global kids sensation ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" which led to lucrative partnerships with Rupert Murdoch at News Corporation. Now, Saban runs the investment firm Saban Capital Group, with holdings in music, film, and real estate. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" he joins me to talk about the corporate backlash against Donald Trump, what to expect from Joe Biden's first days in office, and why the Fox-Disney merger left him scratching his head.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm Saban Capital. Hi, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week, with regard to the attack on the Capitol. Do you think that President Trump is, in some way, to blame for the siege on the Capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is in some way. In every single way he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been-- fomented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the Capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime, and he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone. That's what I believe. But apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason-- no rhyme or reason-- to have somebody who committed a crime-- to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the election, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they caught him off, like all the online entities cut him off-- Facebook and Twitter-- if-- outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media-- television media-- simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans, from birther all the way to inciting this group of Meshuganas to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuganas is Yiddish for crazy people?

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshugana is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so-- because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always have been divisions but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence, the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about-- they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OANN and the telcos, as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say, Congress people-- who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion. My opinion, you should go all the way, but my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point, Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of the, as I call them, the meshuganas, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and maybe a website here and a website there-- you cannot block everything on the internet-- but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult-- possible, very difficult.

ANDY SERWER: So Biden has a lot of things on his plate, though, Haim. He's got potentially holding Trump accountable. Obviously, the main story should be COVID, right? And then there's the business of confirming cabinet members. What should he prioritize?

HAIM SABAN: COVID, obviously, the economy, support for people who can't put food on the table. And as he said, he's going to do that. You know, he's-- he was very clear that he's going to do that. And knowing him well, he's a man with a heart. He's not interested in Biden. He's interested in the country, unlike Trump, who's only interested in Trump. Nothing else interests Trump but Trump, as he has proven over and over again.

So you know, he's going to have quite a few issues on his hand, whether it's Russia or China. That's on the international platform. And obviously, domestically, we all know what the issues are. So yeah, he's got a plateful, no question.

ANDY SERWER: Do you support the idea of giving Americans $2,000 checks as part of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package?

HAIM SABAN: Above my pay grade to, you know, quote an amount because I don't have, obviously, the full picture of the deficit level, how much more money can the government keep printing or not. So I don't have a full picture. But I'm fully supportive, in principle, for the government to do the maximum to help the people that need help. In principle, I am 100%, whether it's $2,000 or $1,500 or whatever that number is. It really is above my pay grade.

ANDY SERWER: Haim, tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.

HAIM SABAN: I say, baloney. You know, he's-- they say-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously, from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters, maybe he's a little bit left of me, but he's more of a centrist than a left-wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who is able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal, and I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again, there are so many avenues that he can take to address that inequality, but I am truly, in my heart of heart, 100% convinced that he is the right man to address that inequality. He's a guy with a heart. We missed heart over the last four years. We were all served by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us, one way or the other.

ANDY SERWER: You did say you disagreed with him on some things. What were those kind of areas?

HAIM SABAN: You know, I'm a security hawk. For example, I'm not sure that telling the Iranians publicly that he plans on going back to the deal before-- behind the scenes, letting them know what the conditions are to go back to the deal and, you know, offer some carrots in public and sticks privately. I don't think that there have been discussions directly with the Iranians.

Case in point, they're now, you know, increasing the amount of uranium that they have. They're increasing the level at which it's-- so we're seeing the Iranians, basically, despite all the rhetoric by Trump, doing whatever it is they want to do, and they don't give a hoot about what Trump, you know, puts on sanctions on them. Look at the disaster of results he got out of the deal, but look at the test of results. We're a lot worse off than we were before he got out of the deal.

So the bottom line is that I think that there should have been a different approach to Iran. Yes, of course, we all believe that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian problem, whether it's ballistic missiles or, you know, the uranium development, et cetera-- you know, all of these are a main issues. But the way they just-- out of the box, this new administration has said we want to go back to the deal, that's a little worrisome. What kind of a signal are you sending?

ANDY SERWER: Right. The president, as you said, certainly has his hands full on the foreign policy front, as well. I noticed that Kim Jong Un was rattling around and making some noise. And of course, he's still there running North Korea so no shortage of things for the President-elect to have to be concerned about there.

HAIM SABAN: No question.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Haim, and ask you about Saban Capital Group, which includes a company focused on acquiring and distributing feature films and another on music production. Talk about what the business has been like during COVID, and what do you expect during 2021?

HAIM SABAN: Well, traditional media, where we invested our monies over the last 20 years-- we're not a fund. We work with our own money. And we've invested in things like Univision. We bought the largest media company in Germany. We bought the incumbent telecom company and Israel, bought and then sold, and the same thing for Germany. Traditional media is no longer, in our view, an opportunity for private equity.

So we have switched our focus to real estate. We're a big-- well, everything is relative, obviously-- but, you know, we're a multibillion-dollar holder of real estate assets. We have switched our efforts to things like acquiring finished films and distributing them, primarily in the US and the UK.

And music is my first love. I started off playing in a band then I was a producer and an agent and manager. And I'm having a lot of fun with it. I love Latin music. Latin music is exploding. So I love working in the studio. Believe it or not, I go to the studio and work with the producers and the writers and the singers, and it's been a lot of fun.

We launched, about a year ago, our first record. We already have, between our four artists, more than 1 billion streams across different platforms. So we're on our way to have a successful music company. And for me, to listen to music at home and come up with ideas for the artists to implement and share it with them, et cetera, it's been a lot of fun. I love it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I noticed you got your start in music, and I want to ask you about that. I mean, first of all, I think you had a principal who told you you weren't a good student. You self-described yourself as not a terribly good musician. And yet, you've been so successful. So I'm wondering, what is your core competency? You know, what is Haim Saban really good at?

HAIM SABAN: Nothing and everything. Because really good is a very committing statement. So really good? Nothing. Pretty good-- you know, instinct this is a very important trait. And I have been blessed to-- don't get me wrong. I've made plenty of mistakes and made investments that didn't necessarily pan out as I was planning to. On balance, everything is great, but there have been mistakes along the way. And my instincts, in most cases, have served me well and in some cases, not so well. So--

ANDY SERWER: Right. Now, I noticed you have that guitar behind you. Is there any way you could play us a tune?

HAIM SABAN: There is no way because I think you mentioned before that I admitted to being a lousy musician. So I don't want to-- I am. But being a lousy musician, you can still be a great producer, by the way. And the millions of records I have sold as a producer, when I lived in France, is proof to the fact that I knew what I was doing. And you know, the beginning of the success that we're having here with our music company, which is one year old, you know, is proof that, you know, I have a sense of what people want to listen to.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, sort of like you don't have to be the best baseball player to be the best baseball manager.

HAIM SABAN: That's a very good analogy, absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And so just one more thing about this guitar playing on your part, what do you like to play? If you're not going to play it for us, then what do you like to play, what kind of music?

HAIM SABAN: I love all kinds of music. I love all kinds of music. My playlists include everything from classic to Israeli music, classic Israeli music, modern Israeli music, Latin music, pop. I admit that I don't understand hip-hop, so I don't listen to it because I just-- I can't get my arms around hip-hop. I just don't know what's good, what's not good, and there's nothing about hip-hop that's appealing to me, at please. But overall, any kind of music, you know, that pleases my ear pleases my soul. So that's how it works.

ANDY SERWER: Right. And let me ask you, is streaming helping or hurting right now? I mean, eventually, your acts would have to perform live at some point again, right?

HAIM SABAN: Well, realistically speaking, the numbers speak for themselves. 27% of revenue for artists come from streaming, unless you're a phenomenon like Drake or J Balvin. 27% comes from streaming, 63% from all other sources-- touring, merchandising, branding, and the like. And the 63% has been frozen.

But we all hope that with the vaccine, whether it takes another six months or another 12 months-- I don't think anybody has a true sense to put a date on it-- but it will come back. It will come back. And once it comes back, that 63% of sources of revenue will be back on the table, so yeah.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned real estate, which is curious to me because a lot of people would say, wow, that's not a good business to be in right now because of COVID. What's your thesis there?

HAIM SABAN: Well, there-- we are in a-- we don't develop anything. We buy yield, if you will. And we are in categories that have been COVID resistant-- GSA, which is government, as a tenant, self-storage, student housing, you know, manufactured housing. So I am, you know, very sorry for all those that have suffered from COVID in the real estate area, but we have been very fortunate to have been minimally affected-- minimally.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned Univision, of course, which is a deal and a company that you're known for. Where does that stand? You wound that investment up, correct?

HAIM SABAN: Well, we just sold it. We just sold it.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

HAIM SABAN: That was not a shining moment in my investment career, I must admit, because we have been, you know, suffering what all traditional media has suffered. Linear television, according to Bob Iger, the Disney chairman, in 10 years, will not exist. So very few people say, OK, it's Thursday, 9:00 PM. Let's turn on CBS and watch this show. That's not how people watch TV these days. So so many people don't-- especially in the younger generation, don't even have cable or satellite.

So traditional media, we have been one of the victims of the gradual erosion of traditional media. So hey, you win some, you lose some, right? So--

ANDY SERWER: It was--

HAIM SABAN: But if, on balance, you win, you're good.

ANDY SERWER: That-- yes. It was hard to see that coming, I guess. Is there anything you look back on now and realize you could have done differently with that deal?

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, I could have taken my money and put it in an index, and it would have tripled and I wouldn't have had to work that hard for 14 years. So but, you know, who would have known, 14 years ago, that, you know, traditional media would be where it is today?

ANDY SERWER: Well, I think it's great that you can laugh about it because some people would just say, I don't want to talk about it. So the fact that you've sort of processed it and let it go, to an extent, I think is a healthy thing.

HAIM SABAN: No, I let it go. I let it go. I mean, you know, it is what it is. What's important is on balance, what's our investment performance overall. That's more important, in my opinion, than any one specific deal. No one has nothing but wins-- no one, not Warren Buffett, not Bill Gates. No one has nothing but wins. You win some, you lose some, and that's OK.

ANDY SERWER: Only Bernie Madoff had nothing but wins.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: That should have made people suspicious.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, well, exactly. Thank God we didn't have a Donald with him.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Big tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, have been getting into original content, Haim. Do you think they'll succeed?

HAIM SABAN: If they decide, as a matter of a strategic, you know, goal, they'll have no problem because they have all the money in the world to buy the biggest talent in America. And by definition, when you're able to work with the biggest talent, you're going to have a huge success.

So yeah, eventually, yeah, it's just a matter of a strategic decision for the Apple of this world to say, OK, I'm going to be bigger than any other studio. OK, and I have $250 billion in the bank, and I generate billions of dollars of free cash flow. I'm going to do it. And they do it. So I think that it's only a matter of strategic decision for them.

ANDY SERWER: Another thing you're known for is ""Power Rangers,"" and so that brings me to ask you, what do you think future trends look like in the media business, both in terms of content, maybe, and in terms of distribution? How are you seeing things?

HAIM SABAN: Well, I'll speak to the kids business, and the kids business will always be there because every year, new kids are born. And interestingly enough, during this COVID time, companies like Mattel and Hasbro are doing really well. Their sales are up by double digits.

So I think that the toy business is not going away. Entertainment for kids is not going away. We have many more platforms than we used to have, obviously. Take one example of a show called ""Cocomelon,"" which has tens of millions of followers on YouTube.

And so I think that the kids business is going to continue flourishing, again, as I said, for the simple reason that new kids are born every year. So it's a no-brainer.

ANDY SERWER: When you have your content on YouTube, though, can you monetize that? Or are you just helping out Sundar Pichai over at Google to get rich?

HAIM SABAN: Sundar Pichai gets less rich than Sergey Brin and-- what's the name of the other one?

ANDY SERWER: Larry Page.

HAIM SABAN: And Larry Page. Yeah, they get richer than Sundar. He gets plenty rich, but they-- of course you monetize it. A show like ""Cocomelon,"" I am sure, has, you know, very broad merchandising campaigns everywhere. And they sell toys, and they can go on live shows, once live shows come back.

YouTube delivers significant exposure. They're pretty stingy about how they share their revenues with creators, but there's still quite a bit of money, if you're very successful on YouTube. And then all the ancillaries are there, so they absolutely-- shows like ""Cocomelon"" are making a lot of money.

ANDY SERWER: You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it-- I used-- I was on the board at the time of DirecTV. They bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion.

ANDY SERWER: Nice.

HAIM SABAN: So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem that we have worldwide, by the way. So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner-- or the Warner, I should say--

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

HAIM SABAN: --content that they bought, I think, was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

ANDY SERWER: And then Fox and Disney?

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized, it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big. So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized, you need more scale, both at the content and-- as well as the distribution level.

So when he identified the fact that, you know, there wasn't much for him to buy to-- and again, this is my humble opinion-- and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. Rupert is doing all right.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, last question, Haim, this show is called ""Influencers,"" and so I'm curious how you see using your influence on the world.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that is-- how can I-- well, first of all, I might have some influence outside of my household. When I walk back into my household, it's-- as Jackie Mason likes to say, I say, where should I put my jacket? You know, I don't have that much influence.

So on the world, I think that people who have been as fortunate as I have been just simply need to give back. This is how you can-- you know, identify weak points in society that you feel you can be helpful with, and just give back. There's no better feeling than the feeling of giving back. There is no more gratifying feeling than the feeling of giving back. And that's what my wife and I have been doing now for-- I don't know-- 30 years is just giving back to society.

There are some specific causes that are of interest to us. Like health and battered women are of great interest to my wife, the rape center and so on and so forth, the free clinic that carries our name. We are very, very sensitive to people's suffering, and we try to do our part.

ANDY SERWER: Well, best of luck to you on that front and in all your endeavors. Haim Saban, chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, thank you so much for joining us today.

HAIM SABAN: Thank you very much.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Instead of shrinking from the world after he made his billions, media mogul Haim Saban jumped into the fray. The Democratic mega-donor has poured tens of millions into electing the party's candidates, becoming a top power broker with a special focus on policy towards Israel. Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the global kids sensation ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" which led to lucrative partnerships with Rupert Murdoch at News Corporation. Now, Saban runs the investment firm Saban Capital Group, with holdings in music, film, and real estate. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" he joins me to talk about the corporate backlash against Donald Trump, what to expect from Joe Biden's first days in office, and why the Fox-Disney merger left him scratching his head.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm Saban Capital. Hi, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week, with regard to the attack on the Capitol. Do you think that President Trump is, in some way, to blame for the siege on the Capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is in some way. In every single way he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been-- fomented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the Capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime, and he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone. That's what I believe. But apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason-- no rhyme or reason-- to have somebody who committed a crime-- to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the election, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they caught him off, like all the online entities cut him off-- Facebook and Twitter-- if-- outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media-- television media-- simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans, from birther all the way to inciting this group of Meshuganas to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuganas is Yiddish for crazy people?

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshugana is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so-- because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always have been divisions but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence, the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about-- they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OANN and the telcos, as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say, Congress people-- who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion. My opinion, you should go all the way, but my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point, Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of the, as I call them, the meshuganas, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and maybe a website here and a website there-- you cannot block everything on the internet-- but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult-- possible, very difficult.

ANDY SERWER: So Biden has a lot of things on his plate, though, Haim. He's got potentially holding Trump accountable. Obviously, the main story should be COVID, right? And then there's the business of confirming cabinet members. What should he prioritize?

HAIM SABAN: COVID, obviously, the economy, support for people who can't put food on the table. And as he said, he's going to do that. You know, he's-- he was very clear that he's going to do that. And knowing him well, he's a man with a heart. He's not interested in Biden. He's interested in the country, unlike Trump, who's only interested in Trump. Nothing else interests Trump but Trump, as he has proven over and over again.

So you know, he's going to have quite a few issues on his hand, whether it's Russia or China. That's on the international platform. And obviously, domestically, we all know what the issues are. So yeah, he's got a plateful, no question.

ANDY SERWER: Do you support the idea of giving Americans $2,000 checks as part of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package?

HAIM SABAN: Above my pay grade to, you know, quote an amount because I don't have, obviously, the full picture of the deficit level, how much more money can the government keep printing or not. So I don't have a full picture. But I'm fully supportive, in principle, for the government to do the maximum to help the people that need help. In principle, I am 100%, whether it's $2,000 or $1,500 or whatever that number is. It really is above my pay grade.

ANDY SERWER: Haim, tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.

HAIM SABAN: I say, baloney. You know, he's-- they say-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously, from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters, maybe he's a little bit left of me, but he's more of a centrist than a left-wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who is able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal, and I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again, there are so many avenues that he can take to address that inequality, but I am truly, in my heart of heart, 100% convinced that he is the right man to address that inequality. He's a guy with a heart. We missed heart over the last four years. We were all served by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us, one way or the other.

ANDY SERWER: You did say you disagreed with him on some things. What were those kind of areas?

HAIM SABAN: You know, I'm a security hawk. For example, I'm not sure that telling the Iranians publicly that he plans on going back to the deal before-- behind the scenes, letting them know what the conditions are to go back to the deal and, you know, offer some carrots in public and sticks privately. I don't think that there have been discussions directly with the Iranians.

Case in point, they're now, you know, increasing the amount of uranium that they have. They're increasing the level at which it's-- so we're seeing the Iranians, basically, despite all the rhetoric by Trump, doing whatever it is they want to do, and they don't give a hoot about what Trump, you know, puts on sanctions on them. Look at the disaster of results he got out of the deal, but look at the test of results. We're a lot worse off than we were before he got out of the deal.

So the bottom line is that I think that there should have been a different approach to Iran. Yes, of course, we all believe that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian problem, whether it's ballistic missiles or, you know, the uranium development, et cetera-- you know, all of these are a main issues. But the way they just-- out of the box, this new administration has said we want to go back to the deal, that's a little worrisome. What kind of a signal are you sending?

ANDY SERWER: Right. The president, as you said, certainly has his hands full on the foreign policy front, as well. I noticed that Kim Jong Un was rattling around and making some noise. And of course, he's still there running North Korea so no shortage of things for the President-elect to have to be concerned about there.

HAIM SABAN: No question.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Haim, and ask you about Saban Capital Group, which includes a company focused on acquiring and distributing feature films and another on music production. Talk about what the business has been like during COVID, and what do you expect during 2021?

HAIM SABAN: Well, traditional media, where we invested our monies over the last 20 years-- we're not a fund. We work with our own money. And we've invested in things like Univision. We bought the largest media company in Germany. We bought the incumbent telecom company and Israel, bought and then sold, and the same thing for Germany. Traditional media is no longer, in our view, an opportunity for private equity.

So we have switched our focus to real estate. We're a big-- well, everything is relative, obviously-- but, you know, we're a multibillion-dollar holder of real estate assets. We have switched our efforts to things like acquiring finished films and distributing them, primarily in the US and the UK.

And music is my first love. I started off playing in a band then I was a producer and an agent and manager. And I'm having a lot of fun with it. I love Latin music. Latin music is exploding. So I love working in the studio. Believe it or not, I go to the studio and work with the producers and the writers and the singers, and it's been a lot of fun.

We launched, about a year ago, our first record. We already have, between our four artists, more than 1 billion streams across different platforms. So we're on our way to have a successful music company. And for me, to listen to music at home and come up with ideas for the artists to implement and share it with them, et cetera, it's been a lot of fun. I love it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I noticed you got your start in music, and I want to ask you about that. I mean, first of all, I think you had a principal who told you you weren't a good student. You self-described yourself as not a terribly good musician. And yet, you've been so successful. So I'm wondering, what is your core competency? You know, what is Haim Saban really good at?

HAIM SABAN: Nothing and everything. Because really good is a very committing statement. So really good? Nothing. Pretty good-- you know, instinct this is a very important trait. And I have been blessed to-- don't get me wrong. I've made plenty of mistakes and made investments that didn't necessarily pan out as I was planning to. On balance, everything is great, but there have been mistakes along the way. And my instincts, in most cases, have served me well and in some cases, not so well. So--

ANDY SERWER: Right. Now, I noticed you have that guitar behind you. Is there any way you could play us a tune?

HAIM SABAN: There is no way because I think you mentioned before that I admitted to being a lousy musician. So I don't want to-- I am. But being a lousy musician, you can still be a great producer, by the way. And the millions of records I have sold as a producer, when I lived in France, is proof to the fact that I knew what I was doing. And you know, the beginning of the success that we're having here with our music company, which is one year old, you know, is proof that, you know, I have a sense of what people want to listen to.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, sort of like you don't have to be the best baseball player to be the best baseball manager.

HAIM SABAN: That's a very good analogy, absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And so just one more thing about this guitar playing on your part, what do you like to play? If you're not going to play it for us, then what do you like to play, what kind of music?

HAIM SABAN: I love all kinds of music. I love all kinds of music. My playlists include everything from classic to Israeli music, classic Israeli music, modern Israeli music, Latin music, pop. I admit that I don't understand hip-hop, so I don't listen to it because I just-- I can't get my arms around hip-hop. I just don't know what's good, what's not good, and there's nothing about hip-hop that's appealing to me, at please. But overall, any kind of music, you know, that pleases my ear pleases my soul. So that's how it works.

ANDY SERWER: Right. And let me ask you, is streaming helping or hurting right now? I mean, eventually, your acts would have to perform live at some point again, right?

HAIM SABAN: Well, realistically speaking, the numbers speak for themselves. 27% of revenue for artists come from streaming, unless you're a phenomenon like Drake or J Balvin. 27% comes from streaming, 63% from all other sources-- touring, merchandising, branding, and the like. And the 63% has been frozen.

But we all hope that with the vaccine, whether it takes another six months or another 12 months-- I don't think anybody has a true sense to put a date on it-- but it will come back. It will come back. And once it comes back, that 63% of sources of revenue will be back on the table, so yeah.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned real estate, which is curious to me because a lot of people would say, wow, that's not a good business to be in right now because of COVID. What's your thesis there?

HAIM SABAN: Well, there-- we are in a-- we don't develop anything. We buy yield, if you will. And we are in categories that have been COVID resistant-- GSA, which is government, as a tenant, self-storage, student housing, you know, manufactured housing. So I am, you know, very sorry for all those that have suffered from COVID in the real estate area, but we have been very fortunate to have been minimally affected-- minimally.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned Univision, of course, which is a deal and a company that you're known for. Where does that stand? You wound that investment up, correct?

HAIM SABAN: Well, we just sold it. We just sold it.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

HAIM SABAN: That was not a shining moment in my investment career, I must admit, because we have been, you know, suffering what all traditional media has suffered. Linear television, according to Bob Iger, the Disney chairman, in 10 years, will not exist. So very few people say, OK, it's Thursday, 9:00 PM. Let's turn on CBS and watch this show. That's not how people watch TV these days. So so many people don't-- especially in the younger generation, don't even have cable or satellite.

So traditional media, we have been one of the victims of the gradual erosion of traditional media. So hey, you win some, you lose some, right? So--

ANDY SERWER: It was--

HAIM SABAN: But if, on balance, you win, you're good.

ANDY SERWER: That-- yes. It was hard to see that coming, I guess. Is there anything you look back on now and realize you could have done differently with that deal?

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, I could have taken my money and put it in an index, and it would have tripled and I wouldn't have had to work that hard for 14 years. So but, you know, who would have known, 14 years ago, that, you know, traditional media would be where it is today?

ANDY SERWER: Well, I think it's great that you can laugh about it because some people would just say, I don't want to talk about it. So the fact that you've sort of processed it and let it go, to an extent, I think is a healthy thing.

HAIM SABAN: No, I let it go. I let it go. I mean, you know, it is what it is. What's important is on balance, what's our investment performance overall. That's more important, in my opinion, than any one specific deal. No one has nothing but wins-- no one, not Warren Buffett, not Bill Gates. No one has nothing but wins. You win some, you lose some, and that's OK.

ANDY SERWER: Only Bernie Madoff had nothing but wins.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: That should have made people suspicious.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, well, exactly. Thank God we didn't have a Donald with him.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Big tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, have been getting into original content, Haim. Do you think they'll succeed?

HAIM SABAN: If they decide, as a matter of a strategic, you know, goal, they'll have no problem because they have all the money in the world to buy the biggest talent in America. And by definition, when you're able to work with the biggest talent, you're going to have a huge success.

So yeah, eventually, yeah, it's just a matter of a strategic decision for the Apple of this world to say, OK, I'm going to be bigger than any other studio. OK, and I have $250 billion in the bank, and I generate billions of dollars of free cash flow. I'm going to do it. And they do it. So I think that it's only a matter of strategic decision for them.

ANDY SERWER: Another thing you're known for is ""Power Rangers,"" and so that brings me to ask you, what do you think future trends look like in the media business, both in terms of content, maybe, and in terms of distribution? How are you seeing things?

HAIM SABAN: Well, I'll speak to the kids business, and the kids business will always be there because every year, new kids are born. And interestingly enough, during this COVID time, companies like Mattel and Hasbro are doing really well. Their sales are up by double digits.

So I think that the toy business is not going away. Entertainment for kids is not going away. We have many more platforms than we used to have, obviously. Take one example of a show called ""Cocomelon,"" which has tens of millions of followers on YouTube.

And so I think that the kids business is going to continue flourishing, again, as I said, for the simple reason that new kids are born every year. So it's a no-brainer.

ANDY SERWER: When you have your content on YouTube, though, can you monetize that? Or are you just helping out Sundar Pichai over at Google to get rich?

HAIM SABAN: Sundar Pichai gets less rich than Sergey Brin and-- what's the name of the other one?

ANDY SERWER: Larry Page.

HAIM SABAN: And Larry Page. Yeah, they get richer than Sundar. He gets plenty rich, but they-- of course you monetize it. A show like ""Cocomelon,"" I am sure, has, you know, very broad merchandising campaigns everywhere. And they sell toys, and they can go on live shows, once live shows come back.

YouTube delivers significant exposure. They're pretty stingy about how they share their revenues with creators, but there's still quite a bit of money, if you're very successful on YouTube. And then all the ancillaries are there, so they absolutely-- shows like ""Cocomelon"" are making a lot of money.

ANDY SERWER: You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it-- I used-- I was on the board at the time of DirecTV. They bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion.

ANDY SERWER: Nice.

HAIM SABAN: So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem that we have worldwide, by the way. So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner-- or the Warner, I should say--

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

HAIM SABAN: --content that they bought, I think, was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

ANDY SERWER: And then Fox and Disney?

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized, it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big. So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized, you need more scale, both at the content and-- as well as the distribution level.

So when he identified the fact that, you know, there wasn't much for him to buy to-- and again, this is my humble opinion-- and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. Rupert is doing all right.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, last question, Haim, this show is called ""Influencers,"" and so I'm curious how you see using your influence on the world.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that is-- how can I-- well, first of all, I might have some influence outside of my household. When I walk back into my household, it's-- as Jackie Mason likes to say, I say, where should I put my jacket? You know, I don't have that much influence.

So on the world, I think that people who have been as fortunate as I have been just simply need to give back. This is how you can-- you know, identify weak points in society that you feel you can be helpful with, and just give back. There's no better feeling than the feeling of giving back. There is no more gratifying feeling than the feeling of giving back. And that's what my wife and I have been doing now for-- I don't know-- 30 years is just giving back to society.

There are some specific causes that are of interest to us. Like health and battered women are of great interest to my wife, the rape center and so on and so forth, the free clinic that carries our name. We are very, very sensitive to people's suffering, and we try to do our part.

ANDY SERWER: Well, best of luck to you on that front and in all your endeavors. Haim Saban, chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, thank you so much for joining us today.

As the famous saying goes, music is the food of the soul. Not only food though, music is also a large part of almost every culture. It is often an integral part of their identity. It serves as a tool to unite people. In an age where globalization is constantly bringing the world closer today, music provides people something to talk about, to bond over. Whether it be music tours of large festivals, people have always found a way to enjoy the tunes with company. From culture to nationalism, music has a way of expressing every core identity. It has been also used as a tool for political activism, promoting solidarity under a common cause.

We as humans have the constant urge to express ourselves and music provides a platform for it. That platform has grown so much that we have a whole industry for the art. The music industry is one of the most, if not the most, dominant industries in entertainment. It emerged almost a century ago and has become a big part of a country’s economy. It provides sustenance to a considerable chunk of society and has become a major source of revenue for governments. Apart from employing artists and creators, the industry provides all sorts of employment in all fields.

This is part of managing and distributing music on large levels. Three of the giants in the industry are Universal Music Group (UMGP), Sony Entertainment Inc. (NYSE:SNY) and Warner Music Group (NASDAQ: WMG). They are in charge of music recordings and videos as well as their distribution. Each of these labels have a glittering catalogue of universally acclaimed artists. Universal Music Group, the leader in terms of revenue has the likes of Taylor Swift, Lana Del Ray, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna amongst others on its roster. The label is owned by Vivendi and Tencent . The record label accumulates a revenue of approximately 7 billion USD. Sony Entertainment Inc., is a close second. The label has Mariah Carey, Shakira, Britney Spears and the Queen Bee Beyoncé herself as part of its artists. The third world music giant, Warner Music boasts a catalogue including Ed Sheeran, Madonna, Charlie XCX, Camilla Cabello and Jason Derulo. Its parent company is Access Industries. A combined revenue generated by the three music giants is equal to approximately 18 Million USD per year! Safe to say, they contribute to a large part of the economy.

Another large money making sub industry in the music department is the streaming platform clan. YouTube to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) to Apple Music (NASDAQ: AAPL), each has an importance of its own and earn just as much, and sometimes more than the aforementioned record labels. While music for YouTube is just part of the services and different entertainment options it provides, Spotify and Apple Music deal largely in music.

While mainstream artists and music are certainly what come to mind when you think about the music industry, another phenomenon of entertainment are the one hit wonders. The songs are categorized when a fairly unknown or unpopular artist or group releases a song which amasses fame and tops music charts but the subsequent projects of the artist or group fail to replicate that fame. Hence the name one hit wonders. History has seen many such tracks by a myriad of artists from The Weather Girl’s Its Raining Men to James Blunt’s love Ballad You’re Beautiful, the category is filled with these fun, sometimes annoying ear bugs. Here we have a list of the 20 biggest one hit wonders in the music industry. We have ranked them by the number of weeks they stayed on Top 40 chart, compiled from the Billboard 100. The data has been collected from listings in the Billboard 100, Wall Street and USA Today.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the elections worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they cut him off like all the online entities cut him off, Facebook and Twitter, outside of Fox News, Fox News is a special animal within itself, but if all the other media, television media, simply don't give him a platform.

You give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans from birther all the way to inciting this group of meshuggeners to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuggener is Yiddish for crazy people.

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshuggener is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden, because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so, because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always-- always have been divisions, but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OAN and the telcos as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say Congress people who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion? My opinion, you should go all the way. But my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point of Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of, as I call them, the meshuggeners, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and there may be a website here and a website there, you cannot block everything on the internet, but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform, because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult.

260,2021-01-13T02:50:09+00:00,TSMC Profit Surge Cements Kingpin Role in Global Chip Crunch,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. likely chalked up its fastest pace of profit growth in a decade, after the Taiwanese company cemented its role as chipmaker of choice to the world’s technology and auto giants.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker is projected to report a 48.6% rise in 2020 net income Thursday, its speediest rate of expansion since 2010. Investors have sent its stock soaring 70% since the start of 2020, betting that the likes of Apple Inc. will continue to lean on its widening technological lead over Samsung Electronics Co. On Tuesday, Bernstein analysts raised their target on its shares to NT$800, anticipating a further gain of more than 30%.

Taiwan’s largest company has spent billions in past years ensuring it remains at the forefront of chipmaking technology -- a costly exercise that paid off after Covid-19 sent millions online and powered demand for smartphones and computers. With chips becoming ubiquitous in everything from cars to fridges, it’s now become a lynchpin in a plethora of sectors including automaking.

As rivals like United Microelectronics Corp. fall behind and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. struggles with American sanctions, TSMC’s pivotal role is likely to expand in 2021. Already, its preference for larger-volume electronics clients is exacerbating a severe shortage of automotive chips that’s forcing firms like Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to curtail production. Even Intel Corp. is now said to be considering outsourcing to the Asian firm after a series of inhouse technology slip-ups.

“The world needs advanced silicon and only TSMC has that,” Bernstein’s Mark Li wrote. “There is risk if Intel regains and keeps tech superiority, but scale & execution record make it unlikely.”

TSMC “is everyone’s foundry and treats its customers fairly and equally,” the chipmaker said in a statement Wednesday, stressing that it doesn’t play favorites.

Apple’s main chipmaker has predicted that the industry “mega trends” of 5G and high performance computing-related products will continue to drive growth over the long term. It’s expected to report a 14% rise in net income for the December quarter off record sales, moderating from the heady pace of expansion in previous months.

On Thursday, investors will want to see if TSMC will set aside another record amount for capital spending in 2021, after shelling out an estimated $17 billion last year to maintain its edge. And the auto industry would also be keen to hear whether TSMC has a solution to the shortages now plaguing its biggest names.

Foundries such as TSMC, UMC and Globalfoundries Inc. aren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also Xboxes and PlayStations and even certain iPhones. TSMC is by far the most advanced of the foundries responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors, serving the likes of Qualcomm Inc. and NXP Semiconductors NV, which also supply the mobile and auto industries.

262,2021-01-12T09:45:11+00:00,Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories Worldwide,"(Bloomberg) -- More than a year after its outbreak, the coronavirus keeps finding new ways to hit carmakers.

After first wiping out auto demand, the virus is now hindering parts supply: chips used in vehicles are harder to come by because semiconductor manufacturers allocated more capacity to meet soaring demand from consumer-electronics makers such as Apple Inc.

The shortage risks dragging on, with lockdowns and travel restrictions prompting housebound consumers to snap up more phones, game consoles, smart TVs and laptops to get online. Lower down in importance to chipmakers, auto manufacturers from Toyota Motor Corp. to Volkswagen AG risk not getting enough goods to fuel a fledgling recovery in their own industry.

“Customers can’t build because they can’t get parts,” Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of car-component supplier Aptiv Plc, said in an interview. “We’ve avoided a situation where we’re shutting down customers, but we’ve been impacted.”

Semiconductor shortages may persist throughout the first half as chipmakers adjust their operations, researcher IHS Market predicted on Dec. 23. Automakers will start to see component supply gradually ease in the next two to three months, China Passenger Car Association, which groups the country’s largest carmakers, said Monday.

Chipmakers favor consumer-electronics customers because their orders are larger than those of automakers -- the annual smartphone market alone is more than 1 billion devices, compared with fewer than 100 million cars. Automaking is also a lower-margin business, leaving manufacturers unwilling to bid up chip prices as they avoid risking their profitability.

And while the newest cars require more chips, so do the latest consumer gadgets. Smartphones using so-called 5G connectivity require 40% more semiconductors than older 4G versions. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported record fourth-quarter revenue last week, with new 5G iPhones taking up a large chunk of capacity.

Story continues

The auto-chip shortage stems from overly conservative demand estimates made early last year as car plants closed to cope with the onset of the pandemic, De Vos said. Once the plants re-opened, vehicle sales rebounded more strongly than anticipated after governments unleashed stimulus packages and commuters avoided public transport.

At the same time, foundries such as TSMC, United Microelectronics Corp. and Globalfoundries Inc. as well as chip assemblers like ASE Technology Holding Co. weren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for consumer gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also in Xboxes and Playstations and even certain iPhones. The foundries are responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors and serve automotive-chip companies such as NXP Semiconductors NV, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp.

The Trump administration’s move to blacklist China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December drove customers to seek alternatives and further constrained the global chip supply. Some semiconductor buyers have also been building up inventories to hedge against future shortages or disruptions.

“It’ll take some time,” De Vos said, “but we’re climbing out of it.”

Auto-chip companies cut orders with Taiwanese foundries significantly in the first half of 2020 and when they wanted the capacity back in the second half, the contract chipmakers had allocated it to others, a person familiar with the matter said.

General Motors Co. has asked for the Taiwanese government’s help to secure chip supply, and Taiwanese officials have helped to relay the request to foundries including TSMC, according to the person. The European Union has also approached Taiwanese officials about the same issue, the person said.

There’s no guarantee such requests will yield results -- smartphone and gadget customers contribute more to foundries’ revenue and profit and are willing to shell out more.

“Consumer-electronics companies are ready to pay more for chips to ensure their gadgets will get to market on time,” said Jeff Pu, an analyst at GF Securities. “Carmakers are less inclined to do so.”

Meanwhile, it’s not simple to boost semiconductor supply. Chipmakers need to spend years and billions of dollars to build fabrication plants capable of cranking out silicon for a wide range of products. They tend to err on the side of conservative planning because of the risks involved -- and the enormous potential losses.

At least one major automotive chip supplier is having a significant volume of its orders turned away by TSMC because of lack of capacity, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are no signs of the situation getting easier for carmakers, the person said. A TSMC spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the company will discuss automotive chips at its investor conference on Thursday.

Such setbacks have left some carmakers with no option but to cut production.

Toyota said Tuesday it’s partially halting production in China while Honda Motor Co. is reducing output at five factories across North America as it becomes harder to procure chips.

Toyota, the world’s No. 2 automaker, said the impacted lines were at its factory in Guangzhou, in China’s south. The suspension could result in a cut in January’s output of as much as 30% depending on how long it drags on, the Nikkei reported earlier Tuesday, without attribution. Toyota jointly operates the site with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. Toyota is additionally lowering output of a pickup made in Texas.

Honda, which had to scale back output at its U.K. plant last week, said it will reduce manufacturing of the Accord, Civic and Insight sedans, as well as the Odyssey minivan and Acura RDX, a crossover sports-utility vehicle. The Japanese automaker is also reducing output by about 4,000 cars at a domestic factory, while Nissan Motor Co. is adjusting production of its Note hatchback.

VW said last month it would have to change manufacturing plans. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is temporarily closing a Canadian plant and delaying the restart of output at a Mexican Jeep factory until the end of January.

“The global semiconductor shortage is presenting challenges and production disruptions,” Ford Motor Co. said in an emailed statement. The carmaker is working to prioritize key vehicle lines, “making the most of our semiconductor allocation.” In North America, Ford is idling a SUV factory in Kentucky

Carmakers’ predicament is exacerbated by the fact that chips are crucial for the latest features they are touting, be it assisted driving, large displays or connectivity. Semiconductor-based components are set to account for more than 50% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030, up from about 35% now, according to a report by China EV 100 and Roland Berger.

“Chips are getting more important for the upcoming software-defined cars,” said Shi Ji, an analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “They are essential to all cars, not just electric ones.”

At the same time, foundries such as TSMC, United Microelectronics Corp. and Globalfoundries Inc. as well as chip assemblers like ASE Technology Holding Co. weren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for consumer gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also in Xboxes and Playstations and even certain iPhones. The foundries are responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors and serve automotive-chip companies such as NXP Semiconductors NV, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp.

The Trump administration’s move to blacklist China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December drove customers to seek alternatives and further constrained the global chip supply. Some semiconductor buyers have also been building up inventories to hedge against future shortages or disruptions.

“It’ll take some time,” De Vos said, “but we’re climbing out of it.”

Auto-chip companies cut orders with Taiwanese foundries significantly in the first half of 2020 and when they wanted the capacity back in the second half, the contract chipmakers had allocated it to others, a person familiar with the matter said.

General Motors Co. has asked for the Taiwanese government’s help to secure chip supply, and Taiwanese officials have helped to relay the request to foundries including TSMC, according to the person. The European Union has also approached Taiwanese officials about the same issue, the person said.

There’s no guarantee such requests will yield results -- smartphone and gadget customers contribute more to foundries’ revenue and profit and are willing to shell out more.

“Consumer-electronics companies are ready to pay more for chips to ensure their gadgets will get to market on time,” said Jeff Pu, an analyst at GF Securities. “Carmakers are less inclined to do so.”

Meanwhile, it’s not simple to boost semiconductor supply. Chipmakers need to spend years and billions of dollars to build fabrication plants capable of cranking out silicon for a wide range of products. They tend to err on the side of conservative planning because of the risks involved -- and the enormous potential losses.

At least one major automotive chip supplier is having a significant volume of its orders turned away by TSMC because of lack of capacity, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are no signs of the situation getting easier for carmakers, the person said. A TSMC spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the company will discuss automotive chips at its investor conference on Thursday.

Such setbacks have left some carmakers with no option but to cut production.

Toyota said Tuesday it’s partially halting production in China while Honda Motor Co. is reducing output at five factories across North America as it becomes harder to procure chips.

Toyota, the world’s No. 2 automaker, said the impacted lines were at its factory in Guangzhou, in China’s south. The suspension could result in a cut in January’s output of as much as 30% depending on how long it drags on, the Nikkei reported earlier Tuesday, without attribution. Toyota jointly operates the site with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. Toyota is additionally lowering output of a pickup made in Texas.

Honda, which had to scale back output at its U.K. plant last week, said it will reduce manufacturing of the Accord, Civic and Insight sedans, as well as the Odyssey minivan and Acura RDX, a crossover sports-utility vehicle. The Japanese automaker is also reducing output by about 4,000 cars at a domestic factory, while Nissan Motor Co. is adjusting production of its Note hatchback.

VW said last month it would have to change manufacturing plans. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is temporarily closing a Canadian plant and delaying the restart of output at a Mexican Jeep factory until the end of January.

“The global semiconductor shortage is presenting challenges and production disruptions,” Ford Motor Co. said in an emailed statement. The carmaker is working to prioritize key vehicle lines, “making the most of our semiconductor allocation.” In North America, Ford is idling a SUV factory in Kentucky

Carmakers’ predicament is exacerbated by the fact that chips are crucial for the latest features they are touting, be it assisted driving, large displays or connectivity. Semiconductor-based components are set to account for more than 50% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030, up from about 35% now, according to a report by China EV 100 and Roland Berger.

“Chips are getting more important for the upcoming software-defined cars,” said Shi Ji, an analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “They are essential to all cars, not just electric ones.”

264,2021-01-12T06:48:39+00:00,The World’s Top Maker of Mini Motors Bets It Can Win Over Tesla,"(Bloomberg) -- Nidec Corp., the world’s top supplier of motors for everything from hard drives to power plants, is betting it can make a key component for Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles cheaper and better than anyone else, possibly including its chief executive officer, Elon Musk.

“I very much want to have a top-level discussion with Elon Musk,” Jun Seki, Nidec’s president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. Without an outside partner, Tesla won’t be able to achieve Musk’s goal of producing 20 million EVs a year by 2030, he said.

It’s an audacious overture to a company that flirted with being the world’s most valuable last week, making Musk the richest man, but Nidec isn’t just any ordinary parts supplier.

The manufacturer is a quiet behemoth in the global electric-motor industry. Although the vast majority of people who use the company’s products don’t know its name, Nidec’s motors are used in about 85% of the world’s hard drives and it controls almost half of the global market for brushless motors found in everything from air conditioners to factory robots. Nidec is Japan’s ninth-largest enterprise, with a market value of about $82 billion on Tuesday, after climbing 2%. The stock rose 73% last year.

That’s made CEO Shigenobu Nagamori Japan’s fourth-wealthiest individual with a net worth of $10.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He poached Seki from Nissan Motor Co., where Seki had come up through engineering to becoming vice-COO, a year ago to embark on a bet-the-company pivot. The goal? Turning the manufacturer Nagamori founded in a shed in Kyoto 47 years ago into the world’s top supplier of motors for electric vehicles. Nagamori, 76, is backing the effort with a pledge to invest close to $10 billion over the next five years to grab a market share of 40% to 45%.

With Japan, California and other major automobile markets mandating that all new car sales be electric over the next two decades, the global EV traction motor market is on track to reach about $29 billion by 2026, according to consultancy firm Shibuya Data Count. Up until now, much of the industry’s focus has been on building out the capacity to produce enough batteries, while improving technology to make them more efficient and expand the range of EVs.

Story continues

After batteries, traction motors are the most expensive component of an EV, meaning the segment is ripe for claiming if a company is able to mass-produce a disruptively cheap product. Combining the motor, gears and electronic components, traction motors are also used in electric trains; they must be able to withstand mechanical stress and cool efficiently because of the high power levels involved.

“As we move forward with mass-production, costs will come down and it’ll be easier to win out against rivals,” said Seki, 59, who traveled abroad several times during the 2020 pandemic to secure deals with automakers, seeking to edge out Bosch Corp., ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Dana Inc. and other competitors.

Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, is just one of the many carmakers in Nidec’s sights. The Japanese manufacturer has already reached agreements to provide EV motors to 22 automakers, including China’s Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and France’s Peugeot SA, according to Seki.

Whether it’s a traditional auto manufacturer, or an electric-truck startup or Apple Inc., which is said to be planning a self-driving electric car, “any new company entering into the realm of electric vehicles is a chance for us,” Seki said. Through its joint venture with Peugeot, Nidec also has a “big opportunity” with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, as the automaker is set to merge with Peugeot, he added.

Nidec’s pitch to automakers is its “E-Axle” system, which combines motors, gears and inverters into a single package. As EV makers seek smaller and more efficient powertrains, that will give an edge to manufacturers that are able to design high-precision durable gears and cool them effectively, all while keeping costs down.

To secure the technologies and resources needed, Nidec is ready to spend as much as 1 trillion yen ($9.7 billion) on mergers and acquisitions, Seki said. He singled out gear and inverter manufacturing as two industries ripe for growth.

If Nidec’s vision plays out, it will be able to offer Tesla and other EV makers a traction motor that’s less than $1,000 in under five years, down from the standard today which can run up to $2,000 or more. While batteries make up about a third of a typical EV’s cost, a basic motor makes up about 10%.

Why Building an Electric Car Is So Expensive, For Now: QuickTake

Nidec sees Europe and China as relatively quick adopters of EVs. As such, it has invested heavily in the latter over the past three years and is planning to inject some 200 billion yen into its European operations. The company is looking at Serbia as the top candidate for a new EV motor factory it’s looking to build in the region.

For now, Seki is laying the groundwork to be able to meet a spike in demand that’s anticipated in the decade after 2025. Thanks to greater investment, battery costs are coming down, making EVs more affordable. At the same time, a number of governments including Japan and the U.K. have said they will ban the sale of new gasoline vehicles.

By 2035, annual EV sales are projected to exceed 48 million units, up from roughly 2 million this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. To clinch a share of that, Seki is counting on adding Tesla as a customer. Although Nidec’s U.S. representatives have approached the EV maker, whose market capitalization now exceeds that of Toyota Motor Corp. and Japan’s six other major car manufacturers combined, no deals between the two have been announced.

Despite its outsized valuation, Tesla made about 500,000 vehicles last year, or less than a 10th of what Toyota will produce. Tesla is believed to mainly design and manufacture its own traction motors for the Model S, X, Y and 3. With new factories being built in Texas and Germany to add to plants in California and China, Musk struck an optimistic tone in September that Tesla will hit his lofty goal.

Seki said there are also a number of storied automakers that won’t consider diverging from in-house production of the important electrification technology. Nissan, for one, will equip future EV models with its own dual electric motor “E-4orce” system. General Motors Co. is also designing proprietary e-axle systems.

While Nidec is a relative newcomer to the EV motor sector with much left to prove, the manufacturer is betting that its plunge into the technology can be modeled after its success in hard-drive motors, where it invested early and built production capacity to drive down costs.

The company is regarded as a bellwether of manufacturing trends, picking up early on shifts such as the growth of factory automation. Today, Nidec produces more than 3 billion motors a year, and is betting that the automotive business will make up a growing portion of the 10 trillion yen in annual net sales that Nagamori aims to reach by fiscal 2030.

The next move Nidec is considering after traction motors is to offer nearly complete EV platforms. There will be demand for such packages from new entrants in the sector that would prefer to focus on a vehicle’s interior and styling, Seki said.

With the wave of electrification hitting the automotive industry “this kind of creative destruction is already happening,” he said.

268,2021-01-09T18:45:40+00:00,"Short Selling Legend Jim Chanos’ Top 10 Stock Picks and Tesla, IBM Comments","In this article, we presented short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks. Click to skip ahead and see Short Selling Legend Jim Chanos' Top 5 Stock Picks.

Short selling is a tough business. The upside is 100% at most whereas the downside is infinite. Jim Chanos is among the most successful and longest lasting short sellers in the world. He launched his fund in 1985. According to Institutional Investor between 1985 and 2017, Chanos' short stock portfolio lost 0.7% annually. That means if you invested $1 million in Chanos' short portfolio in 1985 (keep in mind that Chanos is one of the most successful short sellers ever), your investment would have shrank to $725 thousand by the end of 2017. So, how is this an accomplishment? Why is Jim Chanos considered to be so successful? How did he become a billionaire by losing money shorting stocks?

The answer is relative performance. A short seller is successful if his short stock picks return less than the market. If the S&P 500 Index returns 15% in one year and a short seller's stock picks gain 10%, professional investors still consider this short seller ""successful"" even though he loses 10% of this capital. Why? Because short sellers don't just short sell. That's what Chanos did. His Kynikos Capital Partners is actually 190% long and 90% short. His net market exposure is really around 100%. Even though Chanos lost 0.7% annually on the short side of his portfolio, these short positions allowed him to lever up on the long side of his portfolio. Overall, Kynikos Capital Partners returned 28.6% annually between 1985 and 2017, thanks to its 190% long exposure which was enabled by its 90% short exposure.

Labeled as one of Wall Street's best-known stock pickers on the short side, Kynikos Founder and President, Jim Chanos sees a 'Golden Age of Fraud' in the speculative market. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said, ""They begin to believe things that are too good to be true,"" talking about the willingness of the public to 'buy' even if there is evidence of fraud laid out.

Story continues Jim Chanos puppeteer

Aside from being Kynikos' Founder and President, Jim S. Chanos is an American Investment Manager and a Certified Investment advisor who is an expert in short selling and specializes in looking for legal frauds. Kynikos Associates on the other hand is an investment advisory firm that he founded in 1985.

""The longer a bull market goes, the more sense of disbelief erodes"". Chanos, like the other investors, assumed that 2020 will be a write-off. It certainly is easier to find good shorts in 2020 but for him, they're just not working. He said that there are companies that have large problems and are 'mind-numbingly' expensive but the market just 'does not' care about the facts. According to Jim Chanos, the 'zero-interest-rate' made it worse for the short sellers to make a profit. But he warned the bullish investors to not feel so 'relaxed' about the Fed's effort to help raise the economy. ""That's a very dangerous sort of place to be because you're completely counting on the Government to always make a you whole.""

Jim's short portfolio is intended to serve as an insurance policy for clients who want to hedge their own long positions. ""They're looking at the Fed as their insurance policy, not the marketplace. People are quite interested in fundamental shorts but then they shrug their shoulders and say, 'I don't really need it because the Government got my back"". For him, this kind of thinking is a very dangerous assumption for market participants to have.

""Normally, we're right about 2/3 of our positions and sometimes as high as 70% and I would say that the opposite has happened now."" He shared that just recently, they've been right on about 1/3 of their positions and wrong on the 2/3. For Chanos, the valuations in 2021 or even in 2022 would make no sense if we will value these businesses based on where they were in 2019.

According to Jim, there are people who believe in non-sense things for a very long time and he 'emphasized' that you must want to play with these people. ""You want to be in a marketplace and bet against people doing really dumb things with their money...Right now, people are doing dumb things with their money"". He marked that if you're playing properly, then you're going to come out ahead of other people.

Talking about tech stocks, Jim Chanos has nothing to say but purely positive reviews. He stated that a lot of bigger big cap tech stocks are 'pretty good' businesses. Jim Chanos mentioned Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as examples of tech stocks that get a very high return on capital and have high positive cash flow. He said that he would 'not' probably short some of those big tech names even if there's a possible regulation in place with the new administration.

""I think that the incoming administration is not going to be anti-market. I do think they probably will be tougher on bad actors in the market."" Jim Chanos thoroughly dubbed the current market environment as the ""Golden Age of Fraud"". He hopes that the new administration will toughen the cops on the beat and that will be a good thing for everyone.

Jim Chanos stated that the fraud cycle follows the financial cycle with a lag. People start to believe things that are too good to be true even if short-sellers and journalists are pointing out a fact pattern that would lead others to believe that there was a wholesale fraud going on. ""It's absolutely remarkable to me as to how many instances of outright fraud are sort of hiding in plain sight and investors continue to buy the shares of these companies because the companies themselves haven't admitted it yet."" He also said that these fraud companies 'outperform' the market until they admit their wrongdoing. ""That's one of the reasons why I think that risks in this market are much higher than people think."". For him, if people are willing to believe criminals until the criminals themselves admit the crime, then we have a very speculative market in place.  alert, attention, beware, black, careful, caution, clip, copy space, copyspace, crimes, cyber, danger, dangerous, defend, exclamation, fraud, guard, hacking, hanging, hazard, icon, identity, isolated, isolation, mark, message, nobody, objects, over white, overwhite, precaution, protect, rectangle, risk, safety, scam, sign, string, symbol, text, theft, triangle, vulnerable, warning, words, yellow

The prime example of legal fraud according to Jim Chanos is Enron, where everything they did was legal. ""It just depends on the magnitude of what the company is trying to pass off as legal under the accounting or regulatory rules."" He also mentioned that the recent poster child of fraud was Valeant Pharmaceuticals which went from $10 to $260 then back to $10 because it was able to convince investors that its earnings per share were $12 when in fact, they were actually losing money but still, everything they did was legal.

Jim Chanos marked that 30% of their portfolio is composed of companies they suspect to have legal or illegal frauds because they found something wrong with their financial statements. He explained that most shorts are caused by business model issues or business environment issues and not actual fraud. ""But now, we are actually seeing instances of fraud."" he proclaimed.

Speaking of Tech stocks, Tesla's EV is certainly the market leader right now but according to Jim Chanos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), 'also has a problem'. ""It's really a business model and valuation issue with Tesla."". Tesla is trading at half a trillion dollars at the time of the interview and it had a revenue of $30 billion but he said that there is something they do not want in their accounting. Despite what everyone says, Tesla will still be an automobile company that competes with other companies that make cars. Chanos said that 'Tesla is the stock where people pin their hopes and dreams'. ""For some holders, it's an EV company. For other holders its a clean energy company. For other holders it's an autonomous vehicle company... It's whatever people want to believe."" Jim then pointed out that, ""For the trailing 12 months, Tesla 'has not made' any money selling cars. Whatever profit they've shown, it's been very very low and it's from selling tax credits."" So despite the market leadership and the selling of 50,000 cars on average, they're still 'not'

making any money and if Jim will be able to meet Elon Musk someday, he'll say ""Job well done, so far"".  Tesla

""It's been painfully clearly but I will say for the first 4 years of those 5 years, it was actually not a bad short,"" Jim said that he still holds a position in Tesla. Despite these things that happened to Tesla, he mentioned that they were able to found lots of other things that are maybe even crazier than Tesla.

Jim Chanos also explained that in shorting, they use a percent of capital approach for risk management because if they use stop losses, they could have been stopped out from every single great position they ever had. ""Calibrating positions on a percent of capital basis for us has worked better,"" he admitted.

He was then questioned if Tesla is a good thing for the S&P 500 Index. ""A lot of people have bought the stock recently because its going into the S&P 500. I would want to point out to them that one of the ways to beat the S&P was to own Tesla over the past couple of years."".

Chanos said that 'they still like Tesla' but there are so many better stocks for them to trade now. ""Probably my highest conviction is an idea that will surprise the viewers. It's a company that nobody's heard of called IBM (NYSE:IBM)."" He said that IBM is a 'value trap' and they had a lot of success through the years in companies that looked cheap but have had structural fundamental problems. ""The company (IBM) we think, is still engaging in basically accounting high jinx. And it's hiding all in plain sight if you take a look at their numbers."" Jim added that IBM was supposed to earn $9 pro forma in 2020 but the actual number was just $6. He thinks that it's going to be only $5 dollars this year and $4 in 2022. ""IBM increasingly has engaged in lots of games to do this and the latest one is they're going to do a spin-off and now take a lot of charges, that they're going to ask you to add back as part of the adjusted earnings so that the actual gap earnings don't look so bad"". Jim Chanos said that IBM tried to do this thing about 5 years ago and they can only do this sort of 'illusion' for a short period of time. For him, we're in a period where IBM will sooner or later announce that ""we're not really earning $9, $12 or $13. We're actually earning $6, $5 and $4. And it's going to be the next reset."".  ibm, building, business, sign, wall, uk, laptop, tech fair, corporation, office automation, worldwide, international business, international fair, innovation, hardware, london,

As for commercial real estate, the reopening will be beneficial for things like hospitality and retail. Jim Chanos marked that commercial real estate peaked in 2018 and rents have been 'declining' ever since while the department store sales peaked in the year 2000. He said there have been real pressures that were happening in real estate even before the pandemic. ""The reason we're negative on real estate is due to interest rates and that cap rates in which people capitalize cash flows in the real estate business are back at all-time lows, meaning valuations on a dollar cash flow are at all-time highs."". He mentioned that this one is caused by the Fed's zero-interest-rate and because of people's belief that interest rates will never go up again. Jim cited SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) and Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) as examples of REIT's that backed down to the lows we saw in 2018-2019. ""The reason why some of these REITs are still lower is that the cash flows are down 30% YOY. And it's fascinating to us that people have sort of disregarded the cash flows were dropping before the pandemic and are going to stay under pressure because of oversupply of office space or retail space."". Jim thinks that the oversupply brought multiples back from all-time high to all-time low cap rates and it's the risk that investors have to take in commercial real estate. He is also certain that cash flows are going to continually decline even after the pandemic. According to Jim Chanos, there's going to be a 'very interesting opportunity' in the public markets versus the private markets in the commercial real estate since the need for office and retail space is going to be challenged as more retailers go out of business and landlords will be forced to cut rents due to the fact that the 'work from home' set up is now a trend.

Let’s now start to look at short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks:

10. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ)

And it's fascinating to us that people have sort of disregarded the cash flows were dropping before the pandemic and are going to stay under pressure because of oversupply of office space or retail space."". Jim thinks that the oversupply brought multiples back from all-time high to all-time low cap rates and it's the risk that investors have to take in commercial real estate. He is also certain that cash flows are going to continually decline even after the pandemic. According to Jim Chanos, there's going to be a 'very interesting opportunity' in the public markets versus the private markets in the commercial real estate since the need for office and retail space is going to be challenged as more retailers go out of business and landlords will be forced to cut rents due to the fact that the 'work from home' set up is now a trend.

Let’s now start to look at short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks:

10. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ)

Dividend stocks are companies that pay out regular dividends. Dividend stocks are usually well-established companies with a track record of distributing earnings back to their shareholders.

In order to support the US economic recovery out of the coronavirus contraction, the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates low for an extended period of time. We believe the 10-year Treasury bonds yield less than the potential average inflation rate for the next 10 years. A retired American can no longer generate decent income by investing in low-risk bonds. No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly changed how we live our lives today. So when transformation becomes imperative, the best thing we can do is adapt to the change. Including the decisions, we make for our portfolios.

For many low-risk investors, investing in savings accounts or long-term bonds would have been the best option a couple of years ago. However, today when short-term interest rates are near zero, it is the best time we start looking into dividend stocks with long histories of dividend payments as an alternative. Not only short-term interest rates are near zero, long-term interest rates are also extremely low. The 30-year mortgage rates were 2.6% for low risk borrowers just a couple of weeks ago. It may sound counterintuitive but this is the perfect time to borrow money and/or invest in relatively higher risk assets like stocks. The government is on its way to send $8000 to most American families with 2 children. How? By printing money. The Federal Reserve is pushing investors towards speculative investments by limiting the downside during market crashes. Bitcoin's price skyrocketed to $40,000 for a reason.

We don't think it is prudent for retirees to speculate on cryptocurrencies or software stocks that trade for 50 times their revenues. However, there are a lot of dividend paying stocks that offer huge upside potential through capital gains. Hedge funds sometimes invest in dividend stocks not because they need these dividend payments, but they believe that these dividend stocks are undervalued and are more likely to outperform the market. Income investors have the time and patience to wait for these stocks to deliver large capital gains, and they get to collect dividend payments while waiting for these large gains to arrive anyway.

If you haven’t started investing in hedge funds' dividend stocks yet, this is the best time for you to consider it. Investing in dividend stocks allows you to collect payments on regular intervals; there are dividend stocks that pay you monthly, quarterly, or annually. Of course, you have to study the companies you’ll buy dividends into and their terms. Say you’re an avid consumer of Apple (AAPL) products and you believe that their products would still be a lot more profitable in the future, and you know that Tim Cook makes the best long-term decisions for the company, given that the tech giant is well-established, then you hit a sweet spot! At one point in 2020 Apple's dividend yield was 1.5%. If you had bought Apple back then, you would have earned 1.5% in dividends annually, but also enjoyed capital gains of more than 100%. There are hundreds of companies that offer dividends, so make sure to stick around to see the best dividend stocks with upside potential to include in your portfolio.

Billionaire Warren Buffett’s technique is to buy low and hold. In an article we presented the 10 Dividend Stocks Warren Buffett Likes the Most. Buying discounted dividend stocks and holding it for a long period of time makes it one of the safest places to invest your money. If you hold the dividend stock for quite some time, it will generate value on top of the cash dividends themselves.

We were disappointed by the FTC’s decision and maintain there was exciting potential in combining Billie with P&G to better serve more consumers around the world.

In this case the target may be characterized as a protease class that has proved challenging for small molecule discovery. One of the many advantages of DEL is the ability to span chemical space based on elaboration of novel scaffolds, designed without any bias for structures perceived to be ligands based on earlier studies, allowing facile discovery of assets with unprecedented structures and novel biochemical profiles. The current achievement marks the continued progress and success of the discovery collaboration between the companies, spanning a range of discovery programs.

Cable delivered one of its best quarters of net subscriber additions ever and grew EBITDA 5.5%, while losses from closed small business customers have moderated during reopening from the COVID lockdown. Sky, the European TV and broadband business acquired in 2018, retained subscribers at a high rate despite the extended absence of live sports. CEO Brian Roberts stated that Sky remains on pace to double its EBITDA over the next several years. Comcast’s new Peacock streaming service and Universal theme parks are ramping up revenues gradually, presenting more opportunities for Comcast to improve earnings significantly over the next several years. Despite the double-digit returns in the quarter, the company remains discounted. We were encouraged by Roberts’s statement in the quarter that he was committed to repurchasing shares again in the near future.”

First Eagle Investment Management also had a few comments on the stock which we shared in this article:

“Media and telecommunications company Comcast hit an all-time high in early 2020, only to sell off with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and its anticipated impact on the company’s NBCUniversal entertainment unit. Comcast’s stock price has since recovered, driven in part by ongoing strength in the company’s broadband business. Late in the quarter, activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management announced that it had acquired a stake in Comcast, believing it to be undervalued; however, any actions Trian seeks to employ to unlock value may be complicated by the fact the more than one-third of Comcast’s voting rights are held by the company’s founding family.”

7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)

Total Value of HF Holdings: $26.6 Billion

The seventh-best dividend stock with upside potential is BAC. Bank of America offers a 2.2% dividend yield and is among the 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffet. During the third quarter of 2020, the company reported a net income of $4.9 billion.

6. UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (NYSE:UNH)

No of HFs: 89

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.96 Billion

UNH ranks 6th in our list of the 15 best dividend stocks to buy now. UnitedHealth Group offers a 1.38% dividend yield and returned more than 20% since early September. The company recently announced that it will purchase Change Healthcare for $13 billion.

The top hedge fund holder of this stock is Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital which had $1.23 billion invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider purchased 2,000 shares at around $227 in August 2019 and the stock has been up 60% since then.

Polen Capital Management mentioned in an article that UNH is the future of healthcare delivery in the U.S.

“UnitedHealth Group is both the leading health insurance company in the U.S. and the largest primary care provider. It has been building an integrated healthcare model that provides medical care and health insurance to individuals and corporations and to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Insurance accounts for roughly half of the company’s profits, and medical care delivery and technology accounts for the other half.

We believe this integrated, data-driven model is the future of healthcare delivery in the U.S. and should lead to lower medical costs over time without sacrificing quality of care. UnitedHealth is moving to a practice of rewarding providers that demonstrate strong wellness and health outcomes and away from a “pay for consumption of medical care” model that treats people only when they are already sick and where costs are very high. By focusing on preventative care and wellness, medical utilization could decline, and costs should follow.

We expect UnitedHealth Group to be able to grow earnings per share at a low-to-mid-teens rate over time with low cyclicality. In addition, we see little chance of a government-run health system in the U.S. due to the massive cost, especially at a time when federal budget deficits are tremendously high, plus several other factors. As such, we believe scaled players with strong integrated models that are already being utilized to run large parts of government programs will likely continue to play a large role for many years to come.”

271,2021-01-08T19:39:58+00:00,3 Diversified SPAC Stocks to Buy That Don’t Involve Electric Vehicles,"In 2020, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) went from obscurity to notoriety for more than a handful of good reasons. But what does 2021 promise for today’s investors? Three diversified and well-discounted SPAC stocks point at well-positioned buying opportunities. Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening to each these promising companies, then consider risk-adjusted solutions to improve investors’ chances for success.

A year ago this alternative “direct listing” route for stocks to go public was virtually unknown. But now names like Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), Fisker (NYSE:FSR) and Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) have become household names in the investing sphere.

You might notice a trend with the names listed above. They’re electric vehicle (EV) stocks. This theme took the pole position within the SPAC market in 2020. A greener incoming U.S. administration, market heavyweight Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and it’s halo effect, as well as rapidly improving technologies allowed those companies the ability to go public under optimal market conditions. Who doesn’t want the next Tesla, right?

But the EV theme isn’t the only one to consider when searching for SPAC stocks to buy.

The 7 Hottest Small-Cap Stocks to Buy in January

Here are three others to keep in mind as the New Year begins:

Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN)

As we finish the first trading week of the new calendar year, the trend into SPAC stocks isn’t going anywhere. And I’m certain there’s more EV companies still waiting in the wings. Right now though, these other plays within this arena offer diversification that also appears quite timely for buying decisions in today’s market.

SPAC Stocks to Buy: Spotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) flat base breakout weekly chart

Source: Charts by TradingView

The first name on my list of SPAC stocks to buy is Spotify. SPOT is an old-timer as far as direct listings go. It pioneered the process way back in 2018. Spotify may also be the biggest SPAC out there: Its market capitalization is around $64 billion. There’s good reason for that hefty valuation too. Spotify is the world’s most popular streaming music platform. Yeah, even bigger than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its Apple Music service.

Story continues

Technically, shares of this SPAC stock have broken out this week of a flat but slightly wide base of five weeks. With the pattern finding successful support on top of a first-stage corrective pattern, there’s a couple strong reasons for seeing higher prices for SPOT shares in the coming weeks.

Favored Strategy: Feb 26 $360/$390 Bull Call Spread.

DraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings (DKNG) well-supported higher-low weekly chart pattern for buying

Source: Charts by TradingView

DraftKings is a heavyweight within the growing online sports betting market. With states legalizing collegiate and professional sports betting, the ease of virtual transactions and a wildly popular brand within fantasy sports leagues, what could possibly go wrong?

A lot of course.

For starters, there is competition from the likes of MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Penn Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) to name a couple publicly traded challengers. And at times, the price chart will undeniably be a serious threat. Some investors learned that the hard way this past fall. Still, today’s odds favor bullish investors.

Technically, this week’s trading has established a higher-low pattern. The weekly candlestick has found support off DKNG’s larger corrective base from last summer, as well as uptrend support formed off a corrective move from all-time-highs which finished in early November. With a neutral positioned stochastics crossover in hand and shares matching last week’s high, it’s game time for this SPAC stock.

Opendoor is the last of our SPAC stocks to buy. Opendoor is a disruptive online real estate company that uses proprietary algorithms to buy and sell residential properties. The technology is working as the outfit brought in $4.7 billion in sales in 2019.

OPEN shares have established a bullish engulfing pivot low this week. What’s more, the latest price action sets up a fully formed uptrend as this SPAC stock now possess a series of higher-highs and lows on the weekly time frame. As such, value looks to be at investors’ doorsteps today!

272,2021-01-08T19:39:58+00:00,3 Diversified SPAC Stocks to Buy That Don’t Involve Electric Vehicles,"In 2020, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) went from obscurity to notoriety for more than a handful of good reasons. But what does 2021 promise for today’s investors? Three diversified and well-discounted SPAC stocks point at well-positioned buying opportunities. Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening to each these promising companies, then consider risk-adjusted solutions to improve investors’ chances for success.

A year ago this alternative “direct listing” route for stocks to go public was virtually unknown. But now names like Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), Fisker (NYSE:FSR) and Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) have become household names in the investing sphere.

You might notice a trend with the names listed above. They’re electric vehicle (EV) stocks. This theme took the pole position within the SPAC market in 2020. A greener incoming U.S. administration, market heavyweight Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and it’s halo effect, as well as rapidly improving technologies allowed those companies the ability to go public under optimal market conditions. Who doesn’t want the next Tesla, right?

But the EV theme isn’t the only one to consider when searching for SPAC stocks to buy.

The 7 Hottest Small-Cap Stocks to Buy in January

Here are three others to keep in mind as the New Year begins:

Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN)

As we finish the first trading week of the new calendar year, the trend into SPAC stocks isn’t going anywhere. And I’m certain there’s more EV companies still waiting in the wings. Right now though, these other plays within this arena offer diversification that also appears quite timely for buying decisions in today’s market.

SPAC Stocks to Buy: Spotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) flat base breakout weekly chart

Source: Charts by TradingView

The first name on my list of SPAC stocks to buy is Spotify. SPOT is an old-timer as far as direct listings go. It pioneered the process way back in 2018. Spotify may also be the biggest SPAC out there: Its market capitalization is around $64 billion. There’s good reason for that hefty valuation too. Spotify is the world’s most popular streaming music platform. Yeah, even bigger than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its Apple Music service.

Technically, shares of this SPAC stock have broken out this week of a flat but slightly wide base of five weeks. With the pattern finding successful support on top of a first-stage corrective pattern, there’s a couple strong reasons for seeing higher prices for SPOT shares in the coming weeks.

Favored Strategy: Feb 26 $360/$390 Bull Call Spread.

DraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings (DKNG) well-supported higher-low weekly chart pattern for buying

Source: Charts by TradingView

DraftKings is a heavyweight within the growing online sports betting market. With states legalizing collegiate and professional sports betting, the ease of virtual transactions and a wildly popular brand within fantasy sports leagues, what could possibly go wrong?

A lot of course.

For starters, there is competition from the likes of MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Penn Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) to name a couple publicly traded challengers. And at times, the price chart will undeniably be a serious threat. Some investors learned that the hard way this past fall. Still, today’s odds favor bullish investors.

Technically, this week’s trading has established a higher-low pattern. The weekly candlestick has found support off DKNG’s larger corrective base from last summer, as well as uptrend support formed off a corrective move from all-time-highs which finished in early November. With a neutral positioned stochastics crossover in hand and shares matching last week’s high, it’s game time for this SPAC stock.

The 7 Best Marijuana Stocks on the Markets Right Now

Favored Strategy: March $60/$70 Bull Call Spread.

Opendoor (OPEN) Opendoor (OPEN) pullback entry within new weekly chart uptrend

Opendoor is the last of our SPAC stocks to buy. Opendoor is a disruptive online real estate company that uses proprietary algorithms to buy and sell residential properties. The technology is working as the outfit brought in $4.7 billion in sales in 2019.

With a market estimated at $1.6 trillion and backed by well-regarded venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya who has boasted Opendoor as his firm’s next ten-bagger investment, what more could today’s investors want? One spot to start is a nice-looking pullback entry in shares of OPEN.

OPEN shares have established a bullish engulfing pivot low this week. What’s more, the latest price action sets up a fully formed uptrend as this SPAC stock now possess a series of higher-highs and lows on the weekly time frame. As such, value looks to be at investors’ doorsteps today!

Favored Strategy: March $32/$45 Bull Call Spread.

274,2021-01-08T09:09:48+00:00,Hyundai Walks Back Confirmation It’s in Talks Over Apple Car,"(Bloomberg) -- Hyundai Motor Co. backed away from a statement confirming it is in talks with Apple Inc. on developing self-driving car that fueled an $8 billion surge in the Korean automaker’s market value Friday, saying instead that it received requests for potential cooperation from a number of companies.

Revising its statement for the second time in a matter of hours, Hyundai said it had been contacted by potential partners for the development of autonomous electric vehicles, removing any reference to Apple. Shares of Hyundai surged 19% after Korean media initially reported on talks with the U.S. company, only slightly paring their gains after the statement confirming discussions was revised.

By naming Apple initially, Hyundai risks the ire of the technology giant known for its secretiveness when it comes to new products and partnerships. With development work still at an early stage, Apple will take at least half a decade to launch an autonomous electric vehicle, people with knowledge of the efforts have told Bloomberg News. That suggests the company is in no hurry to decide on potential auto-industry partners.

Hyundai’s stock jump in Seoul was the biggest since 1988. A cable TV unit of Korea Economic Daily first reported the discussions with Apple, saying Hyundai completed internal talks on the project and is awaiting approval from the chairman.

Following the report, Hyundai initially issued a statement saying that it is one of various automakers that Apple had been in early contact with. The Korean company then revised that statement less than 30 minutes later, removing the reference to other automakers. A few hours after that, it issued another revision that omitted Apple:

“We’ve been receiving requests for potential cooperation from various companies regarding development of autonomous EVs,” the latest version said. “No decisions have been made as discussions are in early stage.”

Apple declined to comment.

The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker is notoriously secretive with employees and suppliers. In 2018, it warned workers to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the specter of potential legal action and criminal charges, saying in an internal memo it had “caught 29 leakers” in the previous year. In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company’s work under wraps.

Needs Partner

An Apple car would rival electric vehicles from Tesla Inc. and offerings from companies such as upstart Lucid Motors and established manufacturers like Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG. Setting up a car plant can cost billions of dollars and take years, likely the reason why Apple is talking to potential manufacturing partners.

“Apple needs to partner with a carmaker because it doesn’t have production capabilities and sales networks to sell its cars,” said Lee Han-Joon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “Building up those capabilities can’t be done quickly so Apple will need a partner for that.”

Bending metal is also a lower-margin business than providing the software, chips and sensors that future cars will rely on. Apple has continued to investigate building its self-driving car system for a third-party auto partner rather than its own vehicle, the people familiar have said, and the company could ultimately abandon its own vehicle efforts in favor of this approach.

Big Plans

Other technology companies seeking to expand into the autonomous driving space have also sought partnerships. Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving unit Waymo has worked with Chrysler, while Amazon.com Inc. has tapped Rivian Automotive Inc. for cooperation over delivery vans.

Many more alliances combining automotive and technology companies are set to emerge, especially after the coronavirus slowed down such combinations in the past year, said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at consultancy firm Carnorama in Tokyo.

Hyundai would provide Apple with a partner that’s already accelerating a push into new technologies such as electric, driver-less and flying cars. The automaker will spend more than 60 trillion won ($55 billion) in those areas over the next five years and in 2019 set up a $4 billion autonomous-driving joint venture with a General Motors Co. spinoff. It plans to release its first electric vehicle this year.

276,2021-01-08T05:41:36+00:00,Apple Supplier TSMC’s Quarterly Revenue Hits Record on Strong iPhone Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported record quarterly revenue, joining other Apple Inc. suppliers in signaling strong demand for the new 5G iPhones.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker said Friday that December sales totaled NT$117.4 billion ($4.2 billion). Revenue in the quarter reached a record NT$361.5 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations based on previously released monthly sales figures. That came in slightly below the average estimate of NT$364 billion, which had risen in past months as expectations around the iPhone grew.

Shares of Apple’s main chipmaker have rallied more than 70% over the past 12 months and reached a record high on Friday. The company has predicted that the industry “mega trends” of 5G and high performance computing-related products will continue to drive growth over the long term.

“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s 4Q revenue could exceed guidance of $12.7 billion on a continuation of strong chip orders from customers such as Apple” and Advanced Micro Devices, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum and Simon Chan wrote in a note Wednesday. Still, a strong Taiwan dollar and higher expenses for advanced 5-nanometer chip production may pressure the chipmaker’s operating margin, they added.

Revenue for the entire year came in at NT$1.34 trillion, up roughly 25% from 2019. TSMC is scheduled to report quarterly profit on Jan. 14.

Robust demand for the new iPhones have provided a boost to other Apple suppliers. Assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. earlier this week beat quarterly revenue expectations, while British-German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor Plc increased its sales forecasts due to stronger-than-expected demand for 5G phones and tablets.

Baidu Inc. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. will team up to make electric vehicles for the Chinese market, a person familiar with the matter said, deepening the internet giant’s foray into automobiles as its core business slows.

Geely’s shares soared as much as 10% in Hong Kong, while Baidu gained 2% in New York. The pair may announce their new venture as early as next week, the person said, asking not to be identified talking about a private deal. China’s internet search leader picked the fast-growing carmaker after discussions with potential partners including closely held WM Motor, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and FAW Group, the person said. It will control the venture with a majority stake, the person added. Reuters first reported on the deal.

The tie-up marks a significant expansion into auto-making for Baidu, which has for years touted its Apollo open-sourced platform to help manufacturers build autonomous driving and connectivity into their products. The move precedes a Hong Kong share sale that’s said to be on track to raise $3.5 billion to fuel the search giant’s ambitions beyond advertising.

Baidu’s venture with Geely is intended to push Apollo’s adoption in more vehicles, the person said. It will start by building EVs for the world’s largest vehicle arena at Geely plants, though it’s unclear if the partners intend to eventually also produce self-driving cars. Representatives for the two companies declined to comment.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Baidu’s plan to make smart electric vehicles with Geely, as reported by Reuters, may boost the company’s investor appeal as it seeks a $3.5 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong during 1H. While details of the electric-vehicle project are scarce and sales may not cover costs for years, it may be a step towards monetization of Baidu’s autonomous-driving platform Apollo, which it has heavily invested in since 2015.

The platform, which has been described as an Android for automobiles, has about 130 members including Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co., BYD Co., Microsoft Corp. and Geely’s own Volvo Cars.

Baidu aims to monetize Apollo, which the company has sunk billions of dollars since 2015. While advertising remains its bread-and-butter, the company has made bets to commercialize its AI technology through self-driving cars and smart speakers. Carmakers like WM Motor and Geely already employ Baidu’s autonomous techniques, and it has won government deals to develop transport networks and test robo-taxis in cities like Guangzhou and Chongqing.

Baidu’s move underscores how global internet giants are firming up plans to get their technology in front of car buyers who increasingly prize connectivity and smart features over traditional driving mechanics. Apple Inc. is said to have created a team of engineers developing drive systems, vehicle interior and external car body designs with the goal of eventually shipping a vehicle. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has formed a venture with Chinese giant SAIC to explore smart vehicles.

279,2021-01-07T22:21:06+00:00,"Asian Stocks Up Over Hopes for More U.S. Stimulus, Peaceful Transfer of Power","By Gina Lee

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning over rising hopes for more U.S. stimulus measures and a peaceful transfer of power in the U.S. on Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden and his administration are due to be sworn in.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.75% by 10:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT). After declaring a state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area on Thursday, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said earlier in the day that the government would liaise with other prefectures on whether to extend the state of emergency.

South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2.57%. Korean shares are outperforming over reports than Hyundai Motor Co. (KS:005387) is in early stage talks with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop self-driving electric vehicles. Hyundai shares rose as much as 24% earlier in the session.

In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.44%, with the country’s third-largest city of Brisbane entering a three-day lockdown from later in the day.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.24%. MSCI Inc. said that it would remove the Hong Kong listed shares of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd from its benchmark indexes at the close of business on Friday. However, confusion as to whether the trio be included in a U.S. ban on investments in Chinese companies with military ties remains, with the New York Stock Exchange revived plans to delist the trio’s U.S. shares.

China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.47% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.20%.

Investors are still digesting the violence wrecked on Capitol Hill by supporters of President Donald Trump, which aimed to disrupt lawmakers’ certification of Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 presidential election. The certification was eventually completed, and alongside Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock’s victory in the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia earlier in the week, clears the way for Biden’s agenda to be implemented once he and his administration take office.

Meanwhile, Trump said on Thursday, “A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20th … my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.”

However, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer are leading calls for Trump to be immediately removed from office, threatening a new drive to impeach him if there is no action form his cabinet. A growing number of Trump’s top officials, including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, have tendered their resignations.

However, some investors remained optimistic despite the drama in Washington D.C.

“Markets, rightly, in our view, see the U.S. government as ultimately a stable-enough set of institutions even if things occasionally go pear-shaped,” DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas said in a note.

“Politics play second fiddle to economic and corporate fundamentals when it comes to setting asset prices. The country’s economic future coming out of the pandemic remains promising,"" the note added.

Data released on Thursday showed that December’s ISM Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was 57.2, higher than the 54.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 55.9 reading. Although gains in business activity and new orders helped offset the decrease in the number of initial jobless claims for the week, the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is forecast to show a sharp slowdown in hiring when it is released later in the day.

280,2021-01-07T22:21:06+00:00,"Asian Stocks Up Over Hopes for More U.S. Stimulus, Peaceful Transfer of Power","By Gina Lee

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning over rising hopes for more U.S. stimulus measures and a peaceful transfer of power in the U.S. on Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden and his administration are due to be sworn in.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.75% by 10:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT). After declaring a state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area on Thursday, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said earlier in the day that the government would liaise with other prefectures on whether to extend the state of emergency.

South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2.57%. Korean shares are outperforming over reports than Hyundai Motor Co. (KS:005387) is in early stage talks with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop self-driving electric vehicles. Hyundai shares rose as much as 24% earlier in the session.

In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.44%, with the country’s third-largest city of Brisbane entering a three-day lockdown from later in the day.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.24%. MSCI Inc. said that it would remove the Hong Kong listed shares of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd from its benchmark indexes at the close of business on Friday. However, confusion as to whether the trio be included in a U.S. ban on investments in Chinese companies with military ties remains, with the New York Stock Exchange revived plans to delist the trio’s U.S. shares.

China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.47% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.20%.

Investors are still digesting the violence wrecked on Capitol Hill by supporters of President Donald Trump, which aimed to disrupt lawmakers’ certification of Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 presidential election. The certification was eventually completed, and alongside Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock’s victory in the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia earlier in the week, clears the way for Biden’s agenda to be implemented once he and his administration take office.

Meanwhile, Trump said on Thursday, “A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20th … my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.”

However, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer are leading calls for Trump to be immediately removed from office, threatening a new drive to impeach him if there is no action form his cabinet. A growing number of Trump’s top officials, including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, have tendered their resignations.

However, some investors remained optimistic despite the drama in Washington D.C.

“Markets, rightly, in our view, see the U.S. government as ultimately a stable-enough set of institutions even if things occasionally go pear-shaped,” DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas said in a note.

“Politics play second fiddle to economic and corporate fundamentals when it comes to setting asset prices. The country’s economic future coming out of the pandemic remains promising,"" the note added.

Data released on Thursday showed that December’s ISM Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was 57.2, higher than the 54.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 55.9 reading. Although gains in business activity and new orders helped offset the decrease in the number of initial jobless claims for the week, the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is forecast to show a sharp slowdown in hiring when it is released later in the day.

It was also the 11th consecutive year Nasdaq led all exchanges in trading of multiple-listed equity options contracts.

In 2020, Nasdaq’s options markets processed 365 million trades and 2.58 billion contracts. These record numbers, combined with handling more than 8.88 trillion messages, made 2020 the most active year of options trading since options were introduced as tradeable products in 1973, and marked a 52% volume increase over 2019.

“The modern day industrials in the Nasdaq-100 continued to drive the global economy during a uniquely challenging year, and options gave investors another way to express their interest in these great companies,” said Greg Ferrari, Vice President and Head of Nasdaq Options. “The increase in options trading demonstrated to all market participants how Nasdaq technology enhances the price discovery and risk transfer process to meet their investment objectives.”

According to Nasdaq research, elevated volatility and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and COVID-19 fueled record levels of retail participation in the U.S. markets last year. Retail options strategies such as stock replacement, yield enhancement, and portfolio protection were widely used during market fluctuations.

This expansion was led by a sharp increase in shorter-term options contracts, a market-wide focus on retail expansion and customer education, along with the stock splits of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), two components of Nasdaq-100 (NDX), Nasdaq’s flagship index that gained in value by more than 40% last year.

284,2021-01-05T22:00:19+00:00,China’s Dreams of Self-Reliance Still Depend on Japan Inc.,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For signs of how China’s ambitions to become a self-made, high-tech industrial powerhouse are faring, look to Japan Inc.

The shipment values of Japan’s machinery sector are set to hit record highs, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts. Orders placed by Chinese companies for Japanese machine tools have been rising since June and have picked up pace; same for the sector’s general segment. Sales of factory automation equipment are expected to exceed previous peaks.

That's a reversal from the last two years of Chinese rivals grabbing market share as Beijing doubled down on a drive to increase high-end manufacturing, moving away from the mass market, low-margin goods churned out for the last few decades. Chinese makers of all types of machinery and equipment were nudging out typically upper-end Japanese firms, which warned of waning demand from China and uncertainty around it. Meanwhile, the government’s fiscal stimulus helped buoy sentiment for construction-related machinery like hydraulic excavators, where Japanese companies had a firm footing.

Not all the pressure came from competitiveness; domestic firms barely stand up against the foreign ones. In 2018, the Ministry of Commerce opened a one-year anti-dumping investigation into Japanese and Taiwanese exporters of vertical-machine centers – key equipment manufacturing facilities for cars and other more sophisticated processes. At the time, as I noted, it was a case of playing spoilsport: The numbers didn't warrant the probe, nor did the impact on prices. Machinery orders had already been slowing, as had shipments for bearings, a proxy for the industry. Citing the complexity, the government extended the case in 2019. By April 2020, it was determined that everything had been fair after all and no duties would be imposed.

The change of tack amid the Covid-19 lockdown and subsequent recovery showed the limits of ambitious industrial policy. China has spent much of the last year focusing on policies to become self-sufficient, scarred by the U.S.-induced rebuke over its practices in global trade and rocky rebound out of the pandemic. A key part of Beijing’s economic blueprint for the next five years is to bolster high-end manufacturing of machines, 5G equipment and semiconductors for use in the domestic market. State funding is increasingly being targeted toward these industries. The government also wants to upgrade internal supply chains and maintain its role as the world’s factory floor. China is by far the largest end-user of industrial robots, but the number of robots installed per 10,000 employees remains relatively low.

Story continues

In some sectors like 5G, China has doubtless made significant progress. However, the country will continue to rely on Japanese companies for the high-tech niche of manufacturing for a while to come. Consider this: Chinese suppliers command more than 80% of the market share for simple-task linear and Cartesian robots used in the plastics industry. But when it comes to articulated robots, which have more complex multi-axis movements, foreign makers manufacture droves more in and for China, according to CLSA Ltd. analysts. Such machines accounted for over 60% of sales. Japan is one of the largest exporters of industrial robots.

The fact remains that there’s a significant technology gap. More than 75% of reducers, a kind of gear, are imported from Japanese companies like Nabtesco Corp. and Harmonic Drive Systems Inc., according to analysts from HSBC Holdings Plc. These components account for over a third of the cost of industrial robots made in China, compared to 12% for one from Japan. That makes it difficult to be cost-competitive. Chinese companies will have to rely on acquisitions to catch up.

For Japan’s machinery giants, that means the trend – and demand – are here to stay. Chinese volumes will drive business and valuations for manufacturers across the sector. Fanuc Corp., whose yellow robots pepper factory floors making products for companies like Apple Inc., reported that sales in China rose 29% in the first nine months of 2020. Despite a seemingly deep Covid-19 slump in Japan’s economy, the Tankan business survey shows that conditions for manufacturers are increasingly upbeat. The TOPIX Machinery sub-index is up 30% since June; the broader stock market has risen only 17%. Companies are likely to invest more in China to leverage the focus on that country’s inward turn.

China’s ascent as an industrial technology champion won’t happen tomorrow. Barring the risk of shocks from worsening Covid-19-related lockdowns, though, Japan won’t be losing its long-established preeminence anytime soon.

287,2021-01-05T19:11:51+00:00,Two former Apple insiders are building a laser technology startup to fuel the electric car boom,"Aeva co-founder and CEO Soroush Salehian — who spent several years at Apple developing the iPhone, Apple Watch and iPod — won’t say if the tech giant is working on an electric car with autonomous technology as many have speculated in recent weeks.

But what he can proclaim confidently, is that four-year-old lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) play Aeva — which focuses on what Salehian calls 4D lidar — is primed to be the dominant name in the auto industry’s push toward autonomous cars. And perhaps over time, also supply its perception sensing tech to the consumer electronics industry to fuel their desire for spatial capabilities.

“What’s available out there is simply not sufficient to get to the next level of autonomous driving function,” Salehian told Yahoo Finance Live. Salehian founded Aeva with fellow former Apple engineer Mina Rezk. It competes with several other upstart lidar companies that have recently come to public markets, including Luminar and Innoviz.

Added Salehian, “I do believe there will be an instance where I think the sensing space will transition from this typical 3D lidar to this 4D lidar technology as whole.”

Aeva announced in November its intention to merge with InterPrivate Acquisition Corp. in a SPAC transaction. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Before its debut on public markets, Aeva announced on Monday it raised $200 million from Hong Kong hedge fund Sylebra Capital.

The SPAC deal and Sylebra transaction will arm Aeva with about $563 million in cash right out of the gate.

Similar to the other aforementioned lidar SPACs, Aeva isn’t earning profits yet and is pre-production. It has revenue of $4.111 million for the nine-months ended Sept. 20.

The company offers some bold financial projections for investors to ponder, just like its rivals. By 2025, Aeva aims to have $880 million in sales and $349 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA). The company says it’s working with 30 of the top names in the auto industry for its yet-to-be-produced products, including backer Porsche (a division of Volkswagen).

Story continues

Unlike its rivals, however, Aeva has been bold enough to disseminate 2030 financial projections. The big goal: $6 billion in sales and $3 billion in adjusted EBITDA.

And who knows, maybe those numbers aren’t too hyped if Salehian’s former employer Apple gets into the auto mix and ushers in an autonomous driving boom.

“I think if Apple were to succeed in providing solutions within the [auto] space, I do think that there is a huge opportunity within the automotive sector to capitalize on because of the fact they have the focus on quality and the ability to make scalable products. These two forces are no secret about the history of Apple. But I do believe that if this were to happen, it would provide a unique opportunity for the entire automotive industry and autonomous riding space,” Salehian says.

289,2021-01-05T14:00:00+00:00,iPhone Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5G After Tepid Start,"(Bloomberg) -- IPhone suppliers are racing to meet surging demand for Apple Inc.’s 5G handsets after tech-savvy consumers leaped on the first major wireless technology upgrade in a decade.

Robust demand for the devices helped iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. beat quarterly revenue expectations. British-German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor Plc increased its revenue forecasts due to stronger-than-expected demand for 5G phones and tablets.

The numbers suggest the world may finally be warming to 5G with its much faster download speeds and more reliable connections. After spending billions of dollars on new infrastructure, carriers have struggled to sell the costly handsets to consumers during an economic crisis.

They were hoping Apple’s late arrival to the 5G game would fire up demand, but it’s been an uncertain picture for the first few months. Apple shares fell in October after quarterly iPhone sales missed Wall Street estimates and revenue in China slumped, although Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the new 5G-ready iPhone 12 line was well received.

“This update confirms continuing strong performance of Apple’s hardware line-up, still supported by the need to work from home and to learn from home,” said Bryan Garnier analyst Frederic Yoboue. “On top of that it shows that demand for the new iPhones is very buoyant.”

Asian countries including South Korea and China have moved fastest in rolling out full 5G services. U.S. phone companies are piling into the technology to sustain profits for the next decade and are racing to offer the broadest, most reliable network.

At an auction of the nation’s 5G airwaves on Monday, bids from carriers and pay-TV providers surged past $76.5 billion, crushing analyst estimates of $47 billion.

Demand for 5G gear was not a given after several years of sluggish handset sales that plateaued at around 1.5 billion units in 2019, according to data compiled by Gartner. That’s partly because high-end phones have become more expensive: Google, Samsung and Apple have all rolled out several devices costing more than $1,000.

Story continues

Europe’s less profitable phone industry has avoided a headlong plunge into 5G, wary of rolling out expensive services that consumers won’t be ready to pay for. That’s left a region that pioneered wireless mobile phones lagging the world in the latest technology, with many countries still lacking full 4G services. In much of the region, 5G signals disappear beyond the limits of big cities.

If European consumers joined the 5G phone rush, it would give a short-term boost to the profits of carriers that make a chunk of their earnings from handset sales, and encourage them to spend more to close gaps in 5G national coverage.

5G Headwinds

Apple’s 5G push has been complicated by a shortage of vital chips that manage power consumption in iPhones and other devices.

There’s also a turbulent political backdrop. Governments across the globe -- led by the U.S. -- have banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from supplying 5G networking equipment, forcing local telecom companies to more expensive alternatives.

Conspiracy theorists have also promoted groundless and widely condemned theories linking 5G to the spread of coronavirus.

That’s done little to dent long-term optimism over a technology that allows near-instantaneous video downloads and heralds a wealth of industrial applications from self-driving cars to remote surgery and connected factories. 5G is expected to generate $1.15 trillion in revenue by 2025, according to forecasts from the GSMA, an industry body.

“We expect strong consumer demand to continue to filter deeper into the supply chain,” said Andrew Gardiner, analyst at Barclays.

290,2021-01-04T12:07:05+00:00,Foxconn Seals Manufacturing Deal With Chinese EV Startup Byton,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn Technology Group signed a strategic cooperation deal with embattled Chinese electric-vehicle startup Byton Ltd. in a transaction that could mark a large bet by the iPhone assembler on the car-making business.

The companies, aided by the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone, aim to start mass production of the Byton M-Byte by the first quarter of 2022, according to a statement Monday. Foxconn, whose main listed arm is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., plans to invest around $200 million in the venture, a person familiar with the matter said earlier, declining to be identified discussing information that isn’t yet public.

The deal could represent a lifeline for Byton, which is struggling to produce its first vehicle having unveiled its M-Byte concept car several years ago. Under the arrangement, Foxconn will supply Byton with its advanced manufacturing technology, operation management expertise and supply chain resources. The Taiwan-based company is however also talking to other Chinese electric-car makers on potential collaborations, another person familiar said.

Tech companies are increasingly pouring money into developing next-generation cars, including all-electric vehicles and the smart technologies that go with them like autonomous driving and car-to-car communication systems. Foxconn is the single most important production partner for Apple, which is reportedly considering developing a self-driving car of its own. Foxconn is also seeking to diversify a business that depends on the U.S. smartphone giant for half its revenue.

Tesla Supplier

In early 2020, Hon Hai announced a plan to form a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to develop and make electric vehicles in China, though it won’t be involved in any assembly itself. In October, the Taiwanese company unveiled its first electric-vehicle chassis as well as an open software platform that’s aimed at helping EV makers deliver models to the market faster. It will start shipping its first developer kit in April. The Foxconn group has been supplying parts to other major carmakers including Tesla Inc.

Story continues

“The electric vehicle-related business will be very good in the first half of 2021,” Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu said at a company event in Taipei last month.

Hon Hai’s shares closed up 8.6%, their biggest one-day jump since April 2019. Analysts at JPMorgan and Wedbush had also forecast robust iPhone sales last week.

Byton, one of the highest-profile Chinese EV startups, had a tough 2020. It suspended all domestic operations and furloughed staff in July after the coronavirus pandemic made it tougher to get its business off the ground. That suspension has been extended now until June. Even before Covid-19 the company had encountered difficulties meeting announced deadlines on producing and delivering its first model. The company’s website still accepts reservations for cars.

Founded by former BMW AG managers, Byton, initially named Future Mobility Corp., had about 1,000 employees in China as of June and about 500 elsewhere, including the U.S. Its investors include state-owned China FAW Group Corp. and EV battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., which supplies batteries to Tesla.

Byton was planning to enter North America and Europe around mid-2020, former Chief Executive Officer Daniel Kirchert, also one of the company’s co-founders, said in early 2019. The company would consider an initial public offering after new financing and production begins, he said at the time.

The M-Byte SUV can reach 80% of full charge in about 35 minutes and has a top speed of 190 kilometers (118 miles) an hour. It has a range of up to 550 kilometers, according to specs on Byton’s website.

292,2021-01-03T19:01:04+00:00,World's 4th Largest Automaker Set To Take Shape Monday,"Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) and PSA Group on Monday.

Sizing Up: Finalization of the merger, which has been in the works for years, would create the world's fourth largest automaker by volume, Bloomberg reported.

The combined new company, called Stellantis, includes the brands Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati, Peugeot, Opel and DS.

The companies agreed to the $50 billion all-share deal in December 2019. The brands will keep their badges and logos, Reuters reported earlier.

Why It Matters: The company expects its greater scale to give it an edge in an industry undergoing vehicle electrification with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) gaining all the spotlight, and facing challengers from outside, including possibly Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).

But the auto industry has a mixed record of results from big mergers, including one of the brands involved in this one — Chrysler. Daimler-Benz's purchase of Chrysler in 1998 is the classic example that merger skeptics point to as evidence that scale doesn't always work in the industry.

PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares is expected to take on the task of cutting costs at Stellantis. He ""takes a Darwinian view on the industry, arguing that only the strong carmakers will survive the pivot to electric drivetrains and pursuit of autonomous driving,"" Bloomberg reported. His experience in reviving PSA and the brand Opel are pointed to as encouraging signs that he can manage the transformational challenges the company faces.

Recent Trading Action: Shares of Fiat ended the last trading week of 2020 up 1.74% at $18.09. PSA Group trades as Peugeot SA on the Euronext Paris exchange and ended the week down 0.49% at €22.37.

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: If you have sought out customer service over the last year, chances are you interacted with artificial intelligence in some way.

LivePerson is one of the largest players in conversational AI. It has seen huge growth this year. The stock alone up about 60% year to date.

Let's bring in the founder and CEO of LivePerson. Rob LoCascio joining us today. Rob, it's good to talk to you.

AI integration increasingly critical to companies, especially during this pandemic at a time where we have seen staff cuts and budgets get even tighter. Can you speak to the shift in the landscape that you have seen?

ROB LOCASCIO: Yeah, I mean, with the closing of retail, we saw a tremendous amount of growth in our business because a lot of retailers want to create the same experience they would in a store, but they want to create that with their consumers and digitally. So conversational AI is really way to talk to an automation and have a conversation and have that connection that you normally would have in a store.

So that's what-- a lot of that's driven our business online. Obviously sales have gone way up, and we're following that. But retail has really been driving a lot of the growth this year.

ZACK GUZMAN: And, Rob, you paired up with digital banking platform Bella, which you're an advisor there, a company that's striving to bank with compassion. You wouldn't necessarily-- I wouldn't necessarily think of chatbots as being all that compassionate, but what are you seeing with that partnership, and what does it say maybe about the evolution and what people might expect from chatbots and from customer service there?

ROB LOCASCIO: Yeah, first of all, the concept of chatbots, you're right. When we say that word, it's kind of we know we've had experiences of this thing that doesn't get us, and it says I don't know what's going on. But the AI that we create on our platform is very powerful, and it allows the consumer to have this very personal experience.

Story continues

So Bella is really, I think, a remarkable platform itself because it enables consumers to have these conversations about their financial life and everything like that. And the cool thing about Bella is the bank's powered with love. And it's hard to put banking and love in the same conversation, but it truly happens.

Like, for instance, I was out the other day and I bought a coffee, and Bella came and said, hey, I'm going to-- I'm going to pay for that coffee for you. I hope you have a great day.

And so there's things that happen in the platform through AI that Bella is here to help you and support you, especially in these tough times. So that's the power of Bella.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, it does feel like it's increasingly difficult to figure out whether you're speaking to an actual human or a bot. But, Rob, you've got good visibility on where the companies see this going. How have you seen the investments shift, especially with this acceleration that we've seen to digital over the last year or so?

You mentioned retail is a big growth driver, but what is that next step? What should we be looking for in terms of how we engage with AI and how much companies are willing to invest in that?

ROB LOCASCIO: Look, the vision of our company, which is playing out and you can see it in the stock and the growth in our revenues, is that most of us know about Amazon Alexa, and we've experienced this, but we want every company to have sort of that power and be able to create their own Alexas and put them in the world.

And if you fast forward, you know, five years from now or so, you know, we're envisioning a world in which there is this AI that you trust that cares for you, that you can speak to. If you ever saw the movie ""Her,"" that's kind of what we envision, and that's not some fantasy or a movie anymore. It's something that we can create.

Going back to Bella, that's what we're really creating with Bella is that one day you'll ask Bella, hey, I want to take a trip to Italy. Can you help me? I want to get my kid a tutor. I need a doctor. These are the things that we should be doing through conversational AI beyond what you can see here, Chipotle and ordering a burrito. We do that too. But we're really looking at many different ways in which we can help consumers with their lives.

It's hard getting on the internet and searching for things and ending up on some, you know, web page and trying to figure it out yourself, but what if you could talk to an AI that could really personalize it?

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and Rob, I mean, to Akiko's question, it sounds like, you know, we've heard a lot of companies like yours benefiting here in 2020 as we've shifted to a lot of these companies who had never thought about being online shifted that way. You guys upped your guidance for the full year in terms of revenue and EBITDA pretty significantly here, so talk to me about maybe if you've seen a leveling off as it looks like the return to normal is coming up next year by the, you know, first half, hopefully-- if you've seen a leveling off in maybe companies that you're working with here in terms of the investment they put behind LivePerson.

ROB LOCASCIO: No. I mean, it continues. What was very interesting is we normally see during the holiday season sort of a peak after Cyber Monday and it goes down. We had one of our largest days two days ago. So the consumer behavior has changed. We've changed. So we're continuing to buy this way and I don't see it changing.

This was already happening. This was-- you know, our company was already accelerating its growth. This compounded the acceleration, but it's not a go backwards. The brands and consumers both want to shop digitally, but they want a personal service, and you can only do that through conversational AI.

The web, the internet, and e-commerce failed us in many ways. I mean, I started the company in '95, and I've seen the whole history of it. I mean, it's about-- it was about 15% or 16% of commerce before COVID. Now it's in the 20s, but it never overtook everything like we're seeing today.

We're seeing that commerce is definitely going to shift now to digital. People want to have conversations around products and services. They just don't want to look at a website like an automat, and that's the big shift--

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, for sure.

ROB LOCASCIO: --that we're seeing happen.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and it's definitely played out well for you guys here this year, but appreciate you taking the time. Rob LoCascio, LivePerson founder and CEO, thanks again.

298,2020-12-28T21:34:41+00:00,Analyst: 'Wonder Woman 1984' shows consumers eager to head back to the movies despite streaming threat,"“Wonder Woman 1984” (T) is giving theater chains a much needed boost of confidence.

The sequel, which debuted in approximately 2,150 theater locations across the U.S. on Christmas day but received lackluster viewer reviews, grossed $16.7 million domestically in its opening weekend — far exceeding expectations.

Even with the downbeat reception, the results solidified the Amazon princess’ second adventure as the best performing film opening of the COVID-era — a tumultuous time period which saw even Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” fall flat with viewers. The latter only generated about $9 million during its Labor Day weekend debut this year. “Tenet” only generated about $9 million during its domestic box office debut this year whereas “Wonder Woman 1984” brought in 16.7 million

However, theater markets in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco still remain shut down as COVID-19 surges nationwide.

With operations still facing 50% capacity limits across the U.S., “we estimate the $16.7M opening for ‘WW84’ could actually equate to as much as $110M - $120M box office opening under normal circumstances,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Eric Wold wrote in a recent note shared with Yahoo Finance.

“The original ‘Wonder Woman’ released in 2017 generated $103M in opening weekend box office,” according to Wold. In fact, Warner Brothers has enough confidence in the franchise to begin fast-tracking a third installment, according to the media giant.

“We believe this helps support the thesis that when consumers are allowed back to theaters with attractive content, they will once again become moviegoers — with the industry having the potential to begin returning to normal in 2022,” the analyst added. ""Wonder Woman 1984"" success proves that consumers will once again become moviegoers, according to one analyst

Warner Bros. released the superhero flick in theaters the same day it debuted on the studio’s fledging streaming platform HBO Max. Earlier this month, the studio shocked the media landscape by announcing plans to air all of its 2021 movies this way.

The hybrid release strategy was immediately met with scrutiny from major theater chains, with AMC (AMC) saying Warner was sacrificing profitability in order to “subsidize its HBO Max start up.”

Story continues

Although specific HBO Max numbers have not yet been released, WarnerMedia said nearly half of all paying subscribers tuned in to watch the film on its first day — with the platform setting a single-day record for downloads of its mobile app.

But the successful turnout still doesn’t mean consumers wouldn’t have preferred the big screen under a different set of circumstances.

According to Wold, “the decision made by HBO Max subscribers to watch ‘WW84’ at home was more of a decision made for them by local theaters being closed and stay-at-home restrictions, as opposed to the preferred way to watch blockbuster films going forward.”

With so much on the line, “we believe Warner Bros. is more likely than not to reverse course and abandon this plan by mid-year — and either return to a more traditional distribution strategy or adopt one similar the Universal agreement entered into with both AMC and Cinemark Holdings (CNK),” the note added.

299,2020-12-28T21:34:41+00:00,Analyst: 'Wonder Woman 1984' shows consumers eager to head back to the movies despite streaming threat,"“Wonder Woman 1984” (T) is giving theater chains a much needed boost of confidence.

The sequel, which debuted in approximately 2,150 theater locations across the U.S. on Christmas day but received lackluster viewer reviews, grossed $16.7 million domestically in its opening weekend — far exceeding expectations.

Even with the downbeat reception, the results solidified the Amazon princess’ second adventure as the best performing film opening of the COVID-era — a tumultuous time period which saw even Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” fall flat with viewers. The latter only generated about $9 million during its Labor Day weekend debut this year. “Tenet” only generated about $9 million during its domestic box office debut this year whereas “Wonder Woman 1984” brought in 16.7 million

However, theater markets in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco still remain shut down as COVID-19 surges nationwide.

With operations still facing 50% capacity limits across the U.S., “we estimate the $16.7M opening for ‘WW84’ could actually equate to as much as $110M - $120M box office opening under normal circumstances,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Eric Wold wrote in a recent note shared with Yahoo Finance.

“The original ‘Wonder Woman’ released in 2017 generated $103M in opening weekend box office,” according to Wold. In fact, Warner Brothers has enough confidence in the franchise to begin fast-tracking a third installment, according to the media giant.

“We believe this helps support the thesis that when consumers are allowed back to theaters with attractive content, they will once again become moviegoers — with the industry having the potential to begin returning to normal in 2022,” the analyst added. ""Wonder Woman 1984"" success proves that consumers will once again become moviegoers, according to one analyst

Warner Bros. released the superhero flick in theaters the same day it debuted on the studio’s fledging streaming platform HBO Max. Earlier this month, the studio shocked the media landscape by announcing plans to air all of its 2021 movies this way.

The hybrid release strategy was immediately met with scrutiny from major theater chains, with AMC (AMC) saying Warner was sacrificing profitability in order to “subsidize its HBO Max start up.”

Story continues

Although specific HBO Max numbers have not yet been released, WarnerMedia said nearly half of all paying subscribers tuned in to watch the film on its first day — with the platform setting a single-day record for downloads of its mobile app.

But the successful turnout still doesn’t mean consumers wouldn’t have preferred the big screen under a different set of circumstances.

According to Wold, “the decision made by HBO Max subscribers to watch ‘WW84’ at home was more of a decision made for them by local theaters being closed and stay-at-home restrictions, as opposed to the preferred way to watch blockbuster films going forward.”

With so much on the line, “we believe Warner Bros. is more likely than not to reverse course and abandon this plan by mid-year — and either return to a more traditional distribution strategy or adopt one similar the Universal agreement entered into with both AMC and Cinemark Holdings (CNK),” the note added.

Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of $524 billion holding company Berkshire Hathaway, is a revered investor who has achieved incredible success by sticking to the principles of value investing that he adopted from his teacher and mentor Benjamin Graham.

Our calculations of Buffett’s holdings found that between 1999 and 2017, his stock picks significantly outperformed the S&P 500’s total returns. Their equal weighted average monthly returns came in at 0.97% during that period, crushing the S&P by 0.38 percentage points. Even as value stocks slumped heavily over the last decade, Buffett’s picks continued to outperform the market, topping the S&P by 0.21 percentage points per month on average between 2008 and 2017.

Now just imagine what the Oracle of Omaha could do in a market that actually values value stocks. While that day may not be coming any time soon, we did see the strongest push for value stocks in the last two decades after the first wave of positive coronavirus vaccine news hit in early November. Best Value Stocks to Buy

Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway

At a current P/E of 37.4x, the S&P 500 is more expensive than it’s ever been save for two other points in history: at the height of the tech bubble in the early 2000s, and during the 2009 financial crisis, when it briefly peaked at over 123x. The current figure does need to be given its obvious proper context however, that being that earnings have been heavily, and let’s say unfairly, impacted by the pandemic.

That doesn’t mean there aren’t legitimate warning signs that certain parts of the market have become perilously overvalued, namely growth stocks, whose price-to-sales ratio has now surpassed the levels of their tech bubble peak. Renewables appear to be leading the new bubble, with companies like Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), up over 1,000% this year, pricing in several years or even decades worth of growth right now.

Story continues

Given that backdrop and the unquestionable investing prowess of Buffett during any market conditions, it’s a great time to consider adding some quality value stocks to your portfolio. While there’s no clear definition of what a value stock is, it’s generally regarded as a stock that is trading at a lower multiple than either the market as a whole or its particular industry. We’ll go with the former definition for the purposes of this article.

Only a handful of Buffett’s top stock picks did not qualify as value stocks using that methodology, namely Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR). While Apple is generally considered a growth stock anyway, it’s been trading at value stock levels for a long time, including when Buffett first started building a stake in the tech giant back in early 2016. However, Apple’s valuation has now pushed past 40x earnings, eclipsing the S&P’s mark.

The following list of Buffett’s top value stocks is based on Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing with the SEC for the reporting period of September 30. We pay close attention to Buffett and the hedge fund industry’s top stock picks because our research has uncovered multiple ways to profit from their consensus picks.

Hedge funds’ small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 66 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Now then, let’s check out the 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett. Note that all hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 800+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey as part of our market-beating investment strategy.

10. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)

Buffett has owned a stake in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) dating back to early 2012 and has gradually added to the position over the years. He bought another 5.32 million GM shares in Q3, giving Berkshire an even 80 million shares and a 5.5% ownership stake in the automaker.

Buffett praised GM CEO Mary Barra last year for the “sensational” job she has done, which includes successfully modernizing and strengthening its production processes, cutting back on costly overproduction and suboptimal fleet sales to rental companies, and exiting struggling markets. The initiatives have driven GM’s margin expansion higher and lowered the company’s P/E to just over 18x.

9. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)

BK ranks 9th in our list of the best value stocks to buy. Buffett has been a big fan of banks for decades, and has now owned The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) since 2010. Buffett did trim several of his bank holdings earlier this year, including BK, unloading 10% of his BK shares during Q2 while investing in gold, a signal that the billionaire money manager doesn’t expect a quick economic recovery. Nonetheless, Buffett still owned 72.36 million BK shares, giving him an 8.17% ownership stake in the investment bank, which has a P/E of just under 9x.

8. Verisign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)

VRSN ranks 8th in our list of the the best value stocks to buy now. Verisign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is one Buffett’s lesser-known tech holdings, which he’s owned since late 2012. Other hedge funds are starting to take note of the internet infrastructure and domain name registry company as well, as hedge fund ownership of VRSN has jumped by 84% since the middle of 2018.

Verisign has been highly successful in cutting costs and growing its operating margins in recent years, pushing the latter mark higher by 4.7 percentage points to 65.4% between 2017 and 2019. That has allowed its P/E to hover around 2017 levels of 31x even as the stock has gained 185% since the end of 2016.

7. DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA)

DVA ranks 7th in our list of the best value stocks to buy now. DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA) is another longtime holding of Buffett’s, dating back to 2011. He did trim 2 million shares from the position in Q3, leaving Berkshire with a stake of 36.1 million DVA shares and a nearly 30% ownership stake in the healthcare company, which operates about 2,700 dialysis clinics in the U.S.

The company became a target of notable short seller Jim Chanos last year, who characterized its reimbursement model as an insurance scam and at risk of regulatory blowback. The market has thus far disagreed, as DaVita has been one of Buffett’s best performing stocks this year, gaining 54% and currently trades at 18x earnings.

6. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is another one of Buffett’s favorite banks and one of the 10 Best Bank Stocks To Buy Right Now. The billionaire money manager owns nearly 132 million USB shares as of September 30, having trimmed the holding by just 1% this year.

U.S. Bancorp has been hit harder this year than some of Buffett’s other top bank stocks, with shares being down 21%. That’s likely due to its lack of investment banking activities, leaving it with heavier exposure to interest rates and commercial lending. Despite that, USB has actually performed quite well, growing its revenue slightly in Q3 year-over-year and earning $1.40 per share. It trades at about 15x earnings and at a price-to-book of just 1.47x, well below its five-year average of 1.8x.

307,2020-12-23T18:12:06+00:00,"Construction Partners, Surgery Partners, Qualcomm, AbbVie and Garmin as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – December 23, 2020 – Zacks Equity Research highlights Construction Partners ROAD as the Bull of the Day and Surgery Partners SGRY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Qualcomm QCOM, AbbVie ABBV and Garmin GRMN.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

This is what I would call a “bifurcated” market. That is a big word to describe what is really a simple thing. There are two tales to this market. Just as the US economy is experiencing a “k-shaped” recovery, so is the stock market. Meaning, the top stocks in the market continue to be the top stocks while the bottom end of stocks continue to suffer. If you want to stick with the winners, you need to lean on the tried-and-true Zacks Rank. Stocks with strong Zacks Rank tend to outperform the broad market over time.

One such stock is today’s Bull of the Day, Construction Partners.Construction Partners, Inc., a civil infrastructure company, engages in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The company, through its subsidiaries, provides various products and services to public and private infrastructure projects, with a focus on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments.

ROAD is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Building Products – Miscellaneous industry which ranks in the Top 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. In addition to the favorable rank, ROAD enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of A, and a Momentum Style Score of C, which is helping it round out with a VGM Composite Score of B.

Story continues

The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in the recent upside earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts on Wall Street. Over the last 30 days, 4 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year, while one analyst has increased estimates for next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from 80 cents to 91 cents while next year’s number has gone from 91 cents to $1.04.

Bear of the Day:

This market is nothing short of phenomenal. There have been unprecedented moves in stocks across multiple industries. More than just a post-COVID bounce back, this market is really showing what it is made of. It may seem, in a market this strong, that any name you pick will simply go straight up. But the reality of the situation is, there are some stocks out there that will be in real trouble when the euphoria dies down. I mean, stocks with weak earnings trends are going to be the ones that give up the most ground.

One way to avoid these potential pitfalls is to lean on the time-tested Zacks Rank. Stocks with low Zacks Ranks have the weakest earnings trends. These are stocks which could very well fail when investors become more cautious about where to put their money.

Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stocks have the weakest earnings trends. One such stock is today’s Bear of the Day, Surgery Partners.

Surgery Partners owns and operates a network of surgical facilities and related services in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Surgical Facility Services, Ancillary Services, and Optical Services. The company's surgical hospitals also provide ancillary services, such as diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, laboratory, obstetrics, oncology, physical therapy, and wound care; and ancillary services, which consist of a diagnostic laboratory, multi-specialty physician practices, urgent care facilities, anesthesia services, and optical services. It also operates optical laboratory that manufactures eyewear. As of March 31, 2020, the company owned or operated a portfolio of 127 surgical facilities, including 111 ambulatory surgical centers and 16 surgical hospitals in 30 states.

COVID-related shutdowns caused analysts to cut their earnings estimates for the stock. Over the last 60 days, analysts have cut estimates for both the current year and next year. The bearish sentiment has pushed down our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from a 96-cent loss to a $1.23-loss while next year’s number is off from a 50-cent loss to a 68-cent loss.

The Medical Services industry is in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

3 Stocks with Strong Dividends to Buy for Growth in 2021

New travel bans from the U.K. to try to prevent a highly infectious new strain of the coronavirus from spreading across more of Europe somewhat dampened the passage of the new $900 billion relief package. The second stimulus effort is less robust, but should help boost the economy heading into what will be a rough winter for many Americans and businesses amid fresh restrictions.

Nonetheless, the S&P 500 has climbed 13% since the end of October and the tech-heavy Nasdaq touched new records on Tuesday. The rise in coronavirus cases hasn’t outweighed broader optimism heading into 2021, as people in the U.S. and elsewhere begin to be vaccinated. In fact, federal officials project that around 100 million Americans will get vaccinated by February or March.

On top of the vaccine hope, the S&P 500 earnings outlook for 2021 is strong and fourth quarter estimates have improved. Meanwhile, the low interest rate environment likely means Wall Street will be hunting for returns, which should boost stocks.

Despite the positivity, it’s likely prudent to wait a bit longer before going all-in on travel and leisure stocks and harder-hit cyclicals, even though they made a comeback recently. With all of this in mind, investors might want to consider adding stocks to their 2021 portfolios that pay a solid dividend and provide exposure to growth areas…

Qualcomm

Qualcomm is a smartphone chip making titan that’s been on an impressive run in 2020. That said, the stock fell earlier this month after reports broke that Apple has plans to work on its own modem chips. This is part of the iPhone giant’s larger in-house chip push that’s already impacted its long-standing relationship with Intel.

Luckily for QCOM, these are ambitious plans and it won’t happen for years, if ever. In fact, Qualcomm and Apple resolved their legal battle last year, which saw QCOM land a six-year licensing deal and a “multiyear” chip-supply agreement with Apple.

The agreement highlighted Qualcomm’s impressive lead in 5G chips that are vital to the rollout of the next-generation of smartphones. The firm also announced over the summer that it resolved its battle with Huawei that saw it land a new long-term licensing agreement. QCOM is coming off a quarter (Q4 FY20) that saw its revenue surge 73%.

Qualcomm also broke down sales from different segments of the market for the first time to help highlight its growth opportunities in our digitally connected world. This list included handsets, automotive, IoT, and RF front-end, with its connected devices (IoT), coming in as the second-largest segment in FY20, well behind smartphones (handsets).

Zacks estimates call for QCOM’s revenue to climb 29% in FY21 to over $30 billion, with FY22 projected to come in another 7.3% higher. This would mark its best top-line expansion since 2013 and show a strong return to growth after its FY20 sales dipped slightly. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are expected to climb 69% and 10.3%, respectively over this stretch. Qualcomm, which is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, has consistently topped our EPS estimates and its bottom-line outlook has improved.

Qualcomm shares have climbed 65% in the last year to crush the Wireless Equipment industry’s 36% average. Despite its run, QCOM trades at a discount to the broader tech industry at 22.3X forward 12-month earnings vs. 28X. Qualcomm’s 1.8% dividend yield tops the S&P 500’s 1.6% average, Microsoft’s 1.0%, and the 30-year U.S. Treasury’s 1.7%. Meanwhile, 12 of the 20 brokerage ratings Zacks has for QCOM come in at a “Strong Buy,” and it trades 10% below its recent December highs.

AbbVie

AbbVie completed its $63 billion acquisition of Allergan in May 2020. The deal added Botox and other popular drugs to its expanding roster of therapeutics that span a wide variety of illnesses and diseases. ABBV’s R&D pipeline is also strong. This should all help ABBV deal with the fact that its patent protections for Humira, one of the world’s top-selling drugs, are running out. Biosimilars are already available outside of the U.S., with competition set to start stateside in 2023.

Last quarter, global Humira sales climb 4%, driven by 8% growth in the U.S., with international sales down 9%. ABBV’s overall Q3 revenue surged 52%, driven by Allergan’s inclusion. Zacks estimates project that the pharmaceutical giant’s sales will jump 37% in FY20 to $46 billion and another 18% in FY21. The firm’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb 17% this year and another 16% in FY21.

ABBV shares have climbed 15% in the past 12 months to crush the Large-Cap Pharma industry’s 1% average. This includes a 20% surge since the end of October. And despite the recent positivity, AbbVie trades 11% below its 2018 highs. Furthermore, the stock trades at a solid discount to its industry at 8.6X forward 12-month earnings vs. 14.2X.

AbbVie also continually lifts its dividend. For instance, it raised its payout by 10% to $1.30 a share last quarter, with its next dividend payable on February 16 to shareholders of record as of January 15. This pushes its yield up to 5.0% to destroy its industry’s 2.3% average. ABBV’s valuation and its dividend helped it attract Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway’s attention in the third quarter, as the firm bought up pharmaceutical stocks.

ABBV is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now that earns “A” grades for Value and Momentum and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company has also seen more positive earnings revisions recently, and 12 of the 18 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for AbbVie come in at a “Strong Buy.”

Garmin

Garmin’s in-car GPS devices, smartwatches, and fitness trackers that compete against the likes of Apple and Fitbit have helped it become a household name. That said, its in-car-focused devices have become less of a hit in the smartphone age. Luckily, GRMN is well diversified and its expansive portfolio also features fish finders, advanced radars for aviation and boating, and many other higher-end offerings and more commercial focused tech products.

Garmin topped our Q3 estimates at the end of October, with sales up 19% to $1.1 billion. Its top-line growth was driven by serious expansion in its marine (+54%), fitness (+34%), and outdoor (+30%) units. And it is poised to benefit from a growing digital fitness market that includes Peloton, lululemon’s Mirror, and others. “Demand for active lifestyle products fueled strong revenue growth resulting in record revenue and profits for the quarter,” CEO Cliff Pemble said in prepared remarks.

Zacks estimates call for Garmin’s sales to climb 7% in FY20 to reach $4 billion, with FY21 projected to pop another 7%. These estimates would come on top of FY19’s 12% growth and match FY18’s sales growth. GRMN’s adjusted earnings outlook calls for similar expansion during this stretch. Garmin’s earnings revisions positivity helps the stock land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, and it has consistently beat our EPS estimates, including huge beats in the last two quarters.

GRMN has soared 225% in the last five years to crush the broader tech sector’s 137%. More recently, Garmin stock is up 22% in 2020 and nearly 30% in the last three months. Garmin also trades at a discount against the tech sector and it closed Q3 with around $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. Plus, Garmin’s 2.1% dividend yield tops the 30-year U.S. Treasury and the S&P 500’s average and it’s part of an industry that rests in the top 25% of our over 250 Zacks industries.

Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation

Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.

A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks’ just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is only available for a limited time.

This partnership has Magna International and LG launching a joint-venture together tentatively called LG Magna e-Powertrain. This company will focus on the manufacturing of e-motors, inverters, onboard chargers, and in some cases e-drive systems.

According to the news release, both companies bring their own advantages to the creation of EV parts. That includes LG having already worked with companies such as Chevrolet and Tata Motors’ (NYSE:TTM) Jaguar in the past.

Magna also already has its foot in the door when it comes to EVs. Its experience includes developing parts for Jaguar and it also signed on this year to be the manufacturer of Fisker’s (NYSE:FSR) Ocean electric SUV.

Magna was also previously tapped to create Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Project Titan EV. While rumors of the iCar are resurfacing of late, it’s still unclear if Magna will have any hand in its creation.

Swamy Kotagiri, president and incoming CEO of Magna International, said this about the news boosting MGA stock today.

“This partnership fully aligns with our strategy of being at the forefront of electrification and supporting automakers with a diverse and world-class portfolio. By combining our strengthens, we expect to gain investment efficiency and speed to market with synergies to achieve more, all while continuing to capitalize on the acceleration of the electrified powertrain market.”

Magna International and LG note that this new joint-venture will employ more than 1,000 employees across the U.S., South Korea, and China. The goal is to complete the deal in July 2021 with approval from LG shareholders and regulators.

MGA stock was up 8.1% as of Wednesday morning.

310,2020-12-23T11:00:20+00:00,Apple's $549 AirPods Max Headphones Offer Big Sound and Bugs: Review,"(Bloomberg) -- The AirPods Max headphones sound terrific. For almost the price of an iPhone 11, anything less would be a major letdown.

Apple Inc.’s entry into the rapidly expanding category of over-ear noise-cancelling headphones was inevitable, and the end result lives up to the company’s usual high standards. Tested in the U.S. and Japan, across a wide variety of music genres, use cases and connected devices, the AirPods Max showed themselves a tier above the typical $300 pair of headphones in this class. But they didn’t quite justify their $549 price due to some bugs and imperfections.

If you’re an iPhone or iPad user, you’ll find pairing seamless. But once Macs and devices from outside the Apple ecosystem enter the fray, things can become frustrating. In our tests, use with a Mac sometimes led to issues with phone calls and distorted audio. For users in the Windows PC and Android ecosystems, switching between devices requires manual input each time.

Apple keeps pace with the noise-cancelling leaders like Sony Corp.’s $280 WH-1000XM4 without threatening to upstage them. Where the company is clearly in front is with its transparency mode, which delivers mostly natural sound for occasions when you want to hear the world around you without taking off the headphones.

The AirPods Max, built around a sturdy steel frame and aluminum ear cups, are some of the heaviest headphones in their category, but their weight distribution makes that a non-issue in our tests. The mesh headband helps avoid the buildup of any pressure at the top of the head over long periods of use — though it’s also a point of durability concern, as it appears susceptible to picking up dirt or tearing and is not user-replaceable like the magnetic ear pads. Apple’s decision to not provide a case that protects more than just the ear cups compounds this.

As a wireless, battery-powered headphone, this pricey gadget will only last as long as its sealed battery system does — an issue that has plagued owners of regular AirPods. Thus, even while Apple may tout these as audiophile headphones for a new age of wireless music, it cannot promise the same long lifespan as wired alternatives from the likes of Audeze, Sennheiser or Grado Labs.

Story continues

The companies that Apple is most directly challenging with its AirPods Max are the likes of Bowers & Wilkins, Bang & Olufsen A/S and Master & Dynamic, brands that blend fashion and luxury with their technological offerings.

That’s where the AirPods Max are already a winner, in part because of Apple’s brand cachet, their distinctive design and the exclusivity that comes with a high price and early scarcity. Being seen in these will be a fashion statement, one that’s likely to attract more than a few influencers to do Apple’s promo work for free.

But the company that pioneered several innovations with the iPhone and iPad seems to be lacking a true differentiating feature with these new headphones. Apple isn’t doing anything profoundly unique on this occasion, relying more on superior quality and software features like Spatial Audio (home theater-like surround sound) and snappy pairing that have helped popularize the in-ear AirPods.

The AirPods Max do indeed deliver sound quality that makes them a pleasing listen irrespective of the type of music. They’re well ahead of any other Apple personal-audio product. And only a select few in their category, like Shure Inc.’s noise-cancelling $349 Aonic 50, can come close to matching their sound.

That sound quality was addled, however, by a series of intermittent bugs when used with a latest-generation Intel-based Mac. The AirPods Max would sometimes distort sounds and fail to adjust the volume via the headset’s built-in controls. Audio would also not come through sometimes when making and receiving calls from the Mac, with the sound flowing to the laptop’s speakers instead. These issues require rebooting the Mac or tinkering with settings to fix.

Apple doesn’t put a power button on these headphones, asking users to trust it to automatically handle power management. It also has an auto-detect function that switches off playback when the headphones are taken off. But when playing from the Mac’s built-in Music app, that auto-pause feature would sometimes fail when removing the headphones. The issue doesn’t occur with an iPhone nor iPad. It’s a problem that could impact battery life as music could be streaming from a Mac without a user being aware. Apple said it is looking into these issues.

For those outside of the Apple ecosystem, rivals like Jabra Corp.’s $449 Evolve2 85 can maintain constant connections to more than one device and make for a more streamlined, Apple-like experience. But to be fair, all of Apple’s audio products follow the same playbook: they work best when paired with iPhones and iPads.

The case that comes with the AirPods Max is flimsy and lacks real protection. This is disappointing when even the most basic AirPods come in protective hard-shell cases and cheaper rival headphones have more reassuring covers. Apple has argued the minimal design make the headphones easy to hold and store — which is true, but does nothing to safeguard the headband.

Apple says the case has a “smart” element (triggered by magnets) that puts the headphones in an ultra-low-power mode when not in use, but we found the headphones use little battery when not playing music and left on a table on their own. At least one third-party accessory maker, Waterfield Designs, has promised to recreate that function with a sturdier AirPods Max case, but it’s unclear if Apple will open up that feature to third parties.

Battery life, whether streaming sound from Apple gear or Android and Windows devices, has been sufficient to get through a full day and more of music, calls, movies and video games. It’s notable that Apple’s headphones have practically no latency in their playback over Bluetooth 5, making them viable for gaming. Apple quotes 20 hours between charges, in line with other top-end headphones, and it provides a Lightning charging connector — which makes sense as most users likely have iPhones, though it will be a nuisance for other consumers.

Since the first AirPods launched in 2016, users have complained that the earbuds’ batteries typically only last up to two years before needing to be replaced. Given the sealed design of the AirPods Max, that is likely to be a problem down the road as well. Apple says it can replace the AirPods Max battery for $79 or at no additional cost if you take the $59 AppleCare+ option at purchase.

To control the headphones, Apple is relying on three main methods: software on connected devices, Siri voice control, and a minimal set of adjustments with its digital crown. Siri on the AirPods Max is the same experience you’ll find on any other Apple device and the microphones generally do a good job helping the virtual assistant understand your commands. Microphone performance from the AirPods Max is good without distinguishing itself.

The AirPods Max aren’t the first headphones to offer swappable ear pads, but — like Apple’s other products of late — the magnet system is intuitive and the pads will be easy to swap for about $70 when the included pair eventually wears out.

The AirPods Max follow a familiar Apple playbook. They start with a distinctive design and performance beating out rivals, but with a higher price tag. In audio, that’s a formula that failed with the original HomePod, a home speaker that sounded better than the competition at launch but lacked a major differentiator.

With the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, unique advantages like the company’s own processors have helped Apple’s devices stand out. The original AirPods also became a hit based on their ease of use, discreet case and fully wireless design. But with the AirPods Max, Apple is missing a major differentiator beyond its brand cachet.

The high price is to be expected from a company unafraid to let customers spec iMac desktops to $5,000 and beyond, and early demand suggests it’s not proving to be a deterrent to holiday shoppers and Apple’s loyal user base.

Apple is already wrestling with weeks-long delays on fulfilling fresh orders for the AirPods Max and all indications are that it will keep selling every pair it makes for a while. The question, after the initial thrill of novelty wears off, will be how quickly the company iterates to iron out the software issues and how willing it will be to lower the price to broaden the AirPods Max market.

312,2020-12-23T09:00:38+00:00,LG Forms Electric Vehicle-Focused Joint Venture With Magna,"South Korean electronics company LG Electronics Ltd has entered into a joint venture agreement with Canadian technology company Magna International Inc (NYSE: MGA), the two companies announced Monday.

What Happened: The joint venture will manufacture automobile components like e-motors, inverters, onboard chargers, etc, and focus exclusively on the EV segment. According to Reuters, the joint venture, under the tentative name LG Magna e-Powertrain, could reach a valuation of approximately $1 billion. LG will control a 51% majority, and Magna will own the remaining 49% of the JV.

Reportedly, the collaboration will house over 1000 employees across LG’s locations in the U.S., South Korea, and China. Although the deal is yet to be approved by LG’s shareholders, the company expects to close the agreement sometime in July next year.

Why Does It Matter: Both companies expect to benefit from mutual synergies while relying on the growing demand for electric vehicles. LG’s expertise lies in manufacturing electrical components, whereas Magna possesses software and systems integration competencies.

“By combining our strengths, we expect to gain investment efficiency and speed to market with synergies to achieve more, all while continuing to capitalize on the acceleration of the electrified powertrain market,” Magna President and CEO Swamy Kotagir said in a statement.

LG Electronics' parent company LG Corp is expanding its presence in the electric vehicles segment. One of its subsidiaries, LG Chem Ltd is a supplier for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).

Earlier this month, it was reported that LG Chem planned to double its battery cell manufacturing to support Tesla's EV demand. With the growing hype around electric and autonomous vehicles, even the iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is reported to be planning a launch of a self-driving EV sometime in 2024.

Price Action: MGA stock closed 4.11% higher at $66.36 on Tuesday.

Apple has been working on driverless car technology since 2014, but pared back its ambitions from a full-fledged vehicle in 2017, Bloomberg News has reported. Since then, Apple has been working on the underlying autonomous system. The company has been deciding whether to attach this system to its own car, or existing vehicles, or to partner with an established carmaker, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.

Survival of the fittest should be a fading theme in 2021.

Here in the Morning Brief and on Yahoo Finance we’ve written a lot about various markets forecasts for 2021.

The Wall Street consensus says earnings should grow appreciably next year and stocks should continue to rise. The details might differ from firm to firm, but the broad outlines are nine-tenths the same.

And while Rich Bernstein, CEO and CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors, isn’t exactly zigging while the rest of the Street is zagging, we found his outlook offered a unique and helpful thematic frame on what the year and economic cycle ahead could have in store.

As Rich puts it to his clients: “Embrace the profits cycle.”

And the profits cycle tells you that as regimes change, what had been working tends to stop working while areas of the market that hadn’t been working should start finding a bid. Everything old is eventually new again. With the economy entering a phase where the profit cycle is rising, sectors of the market that had fallen out of favor should become more attractive as the economy and profits accelerate out of the pandemic.

“The direction of the overall stock market in 2021 could be very misleading and could mask a significant shift in underlying market leadership,” Bernstein writes. “In other words, the stock market might do well or not, but the potential for a major shift in market leadership could present significant investment opportunities.”

Because while the pandemic and resulting economic fallout brought financial markets and the global economy to its knees, let us not forget the dynamics that were driving markets at the end of the last decade. Narrowing leadership amid a slowing profit cycle — which means market gains were driven by rising valuations not rising profits — helped fuel the first group of companies to attain market capitalizations north of $1 trillion.

The FAAMG stocks became the hot trade at the end of the last decade not because the acronym was catchy but because Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) were the companies with the strongest earnings growth.

“When profits cycles decelerate, markets become ‘Darwinistic’ and survival of the fittest determines stock performance,” Bernstein writes. “Fewer and fewer companies can maintain their earnings growth as overall economic conditions worsen and investors gravitate toward a smaller universe of growing companies and bid up those companies’ valuations. Simply put, the price of earnings growth appreciates as growth itself becomes increasingly scarce.”

But with the economy coming out of recession, a new cycle of economic and profit growth begins. For Bernstein, this mean the trades that had fallen out of favor with investors should benefit next year while the sectors that had been most loved could take a step back.

And so in this case, big cap tech stocks could be shunned by investors like financials (XLF) and materials (XLB) enjoy the early stages of an economic upturn.

“The biggest story for 2021 might not be ‘the market,’ but rather a significant shift in market leadership and sector, style, and size performance that is currently unimaginable to many investors,” Bernstein writes.

“Innovation, disruption, intangible assets, and long time-horizon investing could give way to ugly cyclicals, unknown small caps, downtrodden value, real assets, and investors’ demand for immediate strong earnings growth.”

315,2020-12-22T07:36:23+00:00,An Apple-Tesla Showdown Will Happen on the Factory Floor,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It was kind of inevitable that Tesla Inc.’s biggest challenger wouldn’t be a car company. Apple Inc. makes for the perfect nemesis and could teach its California cousin a thing or two about reliability and delivery.

For years, there’s been speculation that Apple would join the electric vehicle race, with teams formed and development under way. Yet the program also seemed to lack focus, leading to job cuts and changes in direction. Now, there’s renewed hype that an actual Apple-branded car may be in the works, and the aggressive timeline is taking even the company’s fans by surprise.

Automotive suppliers, including Taiwan’s Hota Industrial Manufacturing Co., have been told by Apple to ramp up production of parts ahead of a launch as early as next September, the Taipei-based Economic Daily News reported. Reuters says that Apple has a 2024 timeframe for delivering its self-driving vehicle, with battery technology set to be the secret sauce.

Having sat on plans for electric vehicles for the better part of a decade, the resurfacing of Apple Car rumors has peculiar timing. One reason would be a leadership reshuffle inside the company, as outlined by Bloomberg News earlier this month.

Artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea is taking over the self-driving car unit, an indication that Apple sees software and systems as the key ingredient. Previously, the effort was headed by Bob Mansfield, vice president of hardware engineering.

Another development that went mostly unnoticed outside the EV realm: Foxconn Technology Group is getting into cars. That’s the same company that not only assembles your iPhone but supplies numerous less-significant components for it.

Foxconn announced plans in January and unveiled its own open-vehicle platform in October. The company says it will start shipping a first EV development kit in April, allowing any developer to build a car on top of this barebones chassis and electrical system.

Story continues

So after years of hearing very little out of Cupertino, suddenly we have Apple shifting vehicle plans away from a hardware chief to an AI leader, its primary manufacturing partner unveiling a modular platform, and various news reports from suppliers talking up an imminent product launch.

Let me be clear. I have covered Foxconn for almost 20 years, yet I have no information at this stage that the Taiwanese company has even been tapped to make cars for Apple. To be frank, I think their interdependent relationship is unhealthy: Foxconn gets over half its revenue from that one client, while iPhones couldn’t get made without that key supplier.

But they do seem in sync on one thing: In this new era, a vehicle’s brand and production can and probably should be split. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk vehemently disagrees, and I have called him out on it.

“Cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches,” Musk told Handelsblatt back in 2015. “You can't just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: Build me a car.”

I think his sentiment understates the complex and close relationship between Apple and its entire supply chain. CEO Tim Cook doesn’t just fax an order to Shenzhen and expect Foxconn’s team to bang together a few parts and ship them out the door. Bits of today’s iPhone were being designed five years ago, with manufacturing discussions likely under way two years before launch. And smartphones are incredibly sophisticated, made more difficult by the small size, tight tolerances, fast ramp up, and large volume of production.

Already, one thing Cook can do better than Musk is deliver a high-quality and consistent product on time. What’s holding Tesla back from growing into its $616 billion market value isn’t demand for its EVs, but inability to manufacture them.

Musk recently said that Tesla has “the high-class problem of demand being quite a bit higher than production this quarter.” That could be taken as a boast, but shouldn't be. In effect, Musk is admitting that he’s leaving money on the table. The clear implication: Tesla might be good at designing but struggles at making EVs.

Two decades ago, founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs recognized that Apple’s strength wasn’t in manufacturing Macs, but in designing and marketing them. Dell Inc., HP Inc., Sony Corp., and dozens of others in the technology sector came to the same conclusion. Cars are different, comes the familiar refrain, and can’t be outsourced. Yet global leaders like BMW AG have tapped the likes of Magna Steyr to do assembly.

Musk fancies himself as the man who upended the automotive industry with an electric-only vehicle and direct-sales business model. Investors seem to think that warrants making Tesla the world’s ninth most-valuable company. But maybe the next true innovation in autos will pass him by as he clings to the fantasy that a car’s brand should also be its manufacturer.

Tim Cook looks ready to prove him wrong. This fight will be won on the factory floor.

317,2020-12-21T02:53:05+00:00,iPhone Maker Slides After Riot Spurs Apple to Suspend Business,"(Bloomberg) -- Wistron Corp., Apple Inc.’s main iPhone assembler in India, slid as much as 4% after the U.S. tech giant placed it on probation for lapses in labor practices that triggered a riot.

Apple said its preliminary investigations found the Taiwanese supplier -- the first to produce the U.S. company’s marquee device from India -- failed to implement proper work-hour management processes for a rapidly growing staff. That delayed payment to some employees in October and November, and Apple said it’s now withholding new business until Wistron fixes the problems.

Hundreds of workers rampaged through Wistron’s plant in Narasapura near Bengaluru this month, damaging property and looting thousands of iPhones and laptops, according to local media. That brought into focus the challenges Apple faces as it tries to diversify its huge production base for everything from iPhones to Macs away from China because of Trump-era trade and political sanctions. The strife also dents Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempt to lure overseas investors for his flagship “Make in India” project, especially firms looking to leave the world’s No. 2 economy.

“Wistron has taken disciplinary action and is restructuring their recruitment and payroll teams in Narasapura,” Apple said in a statement over the weekend. “We have placed Wistron on probation and they will not receive any new business from Apple before they complete corrective actions. Apple employees, along with independent auditors, will monitor their progress.”

The Taiwanese company said it’s removed the vice president who was overseeing operations in India and started a telephone hotline for workers to voice their concerns anonymously.

Wistron had quadrupled workers at that Indian plant over about eight months, ramping up production just as the world’s most valuable company began direct online sales in the South Asian nation. But its systems weren’t robust enough to handle the deluge, people familiar with the matter have said.

Story continues

The incident could now affect the relationship with Apple, which has shown greater willingness to clamp down on violations at its hundreds of suppliers. The U.S. giant and its production partners have been criticized in the past for allowing poor labor conditions in China. Last month, Apple suspended new business with Wistron’s larger rival, Pegatron Corp., after discovering violations at a student workers’ program.

Wistron has estimated damages at as much as NT$200 million ($7.1 million) and said it’s doing its best to resume operations at the factory. The Hsinchu-based company has also said the protesters are not its own workers, suggesting they may have been hired by employment agencies, though it’s not clear who is responsible for paying them.

“This is a new facility and we recognize that we made mistakes as we expanded,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement on Saturday. “We are deeply committed to our business and employees in India. We are working diligently on corrective actions to ensure this does not happen again.”

319,2020-12-19T19:59:44+00:00,Apple Puts Supplier Wistron Corp On Probation After Labor Law Violations In India,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has officially put a supplier in India, Wistron Corp., on probation.

What Happened: The tech giant said in a statement on Saturday that it would not continue working with the factory unless it addresses issues raised by a government inspection, Reuters has reported. Apple is putting new orders on old for the time being.

Workers protested and destroyed property on Dec. 12, causing millions of dollars in damage, which led to an investigation by the Karnataka state factories department.

“Though 10,500 workers are employed in the factory, the HR department has not been adequately set up with personnel of sound knowledge of labour laws,” concluded the report on Dec. 13.

Apple said it started its own internal investigation following the report but did not reveal its results.

“Our main objective is to make sure all the workers are treated with dignity and respect, and fully compensated promptly,” Apple said.

Why It Matters: Wistron Corp., based in Taiwan, is accused of violating labor force laws by introducing 12-hour shifts and employing around 10,500 workers when the maximum capacity at the factory is 5,000. It also is accused of failing to pay consistently in full, angering workers and creating an unhealthy working environment.

“This is a new facility and we recognize that we made mistakes as we expanded. Some of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded,” the company said.

Wistron said it would make adjustments and introduce 24-hour hotlines for employees for anonymous complaints, according to Reuters.

Apple’s decision may postpone iPhone production and the company’s manufacturing efforts in India.

“Wistron has taken disciplinary action and is restructuring their recruitment and payroll teams in Narasapura,” Apple said. “We have placed Wistron on probation and they will not receive any new business from Apple before they complete corrective actions. Apple employees, along with independent auditors, will monitor their progress.”

Wistron said it removed the vice president who was overseeing operations in India, and has started a telephone hotline for workers to voice their concerns anonymously.

“This is a new facility and we recognize that we made mistakes as we expanded,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement on Saturday. “We are deeply committed to our business and employees in India. We are working diligently on corrective actions to ensure this does not happen again.”

Apple and its suppliers had been criticized in the past for allowing poor labor conditions in China. Last month, Apple suspended new business with Wistron’s larger rival Pegatron Corp. after discovering labor violations at a student workers’ program, taking strong action to clean up a Chinese-based production chain long accused of worker abuse.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - A major Indian trade union on Thursday slammed Karnataka state for failing to take stern action against iPhone assembler Wistron and accused it of targeting the company's contract workers after a protest over salary payments turned violent.

The protest on Saturday over months of alleged underpayment of dues at a Wistron Corp assembly plant in the southern state spiralled out of control after police were summoned.

The Taiwanese company, one of Apple Inc's top global suppliers, in a police complaint said more than 5,000 of its contract workers had destroyed property and equipment, causing an estimated $60 million in damages.

It later told the Taiwan stock exchange that the damages, which forced it to shut the factory, were worth up to $7 million.

Hundreds of workers have been arrested or detained by police, and the Karnataka government has condemned the violence, vowing to take the ""strictest action"" against the wrong doers.

The state has said it welcomes foreign investment, calling Wistron a ""flag bearer"" for India's electronics manufacturing ambitions. It has vowed to help the company re-start operations and said it will look to address worker grievances.

""The state government is going extremely soft on the company and turning a blind eye to all the violations at the facility,"" said Clifton D'Rozario, national secretary of the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), at a press briefing.

Accusing the government of only caring about foreign investment, he said that workers had not been paid properly for four months and that officials did not seem to be questioning this.

""They are generating employment that is not paying people - What purpose does such employment serve?"" said D'Rozario.

Wistron and the Karnataka government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Apple, which has said it is probing whether Wistron flouted its supplier guidelines, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

327,2020-12-17T07:25:40+00:00,PlayStation 5 Scalpers Use Bots to Hunt Down Scarce Consoles,"(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. has created one of the hottest gadgets of the year in the PlayStation 5, but its launch has been marred by scalpers who are buying up scarce supplies and threatening the long-term health of the company’s most important product.

Scalpers, who buy devices at retail and then resell at a higher price, have long been a challenge in the games business. But the problem is particularly acute this year because the coronavirus has squeezed production and pushed more console sales online -- where scalpers use sophisticated bots to buy up the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

Furious gamers are calling out resellers for charging $1,300 or $1,400, almost triple the retail price, on sites like eBay and Twitter. “This is a launch disaster,” one Twitter post declared, vowing not to cave to usurious prices. “Scalpers can keep them.”

The threat is that Sony’s struggles in the first weeks of the launch could hurt its ability to draw gamers and developers to the new platform, undermining profits for years to come. A console’s debut is supposed to set off a virtuous cycle of consumers rushing to buy the devices, while developers release games that capitalize on new graphics and processor capabilities, sending demand on both sides surging. Sony risks suffering the opposite.

“The PlayStation 5 could miss a critical chance to get into a good hardware-software upward spiral,” said Kazunori Ito of Morningstar Research. “The peak of the platform will likely be low and the platform’s total revenue earned won’t be as strong as we hoped for.”

The company’s share price rose 2.7% to a 19-year high on Wednesday amid undiminished and growing enthusiasm for gaming stocks that saw rival Nintendo Co. surge by 6.6%.

Scalpers deploy bots that constantly monitor online stores for changes in inventory and supplies, then automatically place orders and check out in seconds when devices become available. The technique is based on familiar web-crawling or scraping technology, but is specifically tailored for e-commerce and can sometimes jump to the front of order queues.

Story continues

“One bot preventative action we implemented just hours before the PlayStation 5 event on Nov. 25 blocked more than 20 million bot attempts within the first 30 minutes alone,” U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc. wrote in a statement Tuesday. The company is asking others in the retail industry to join it in lobbying lawmakers to address the bot issue.

Evidence of Sony’s trouble is clear in what’s known as the tie ratio, or the number of games sold for each console. A healthy ratio for a new console is around one, meaning each person who buys a machine also walks away with at least one game. The figure is important because the PlayStation 5 is sold at a loss, while games are lucrative.

So far, Sony appears to be seeing sales of about one game for every three devices -- compelling evidence scalpers are hoarding the consoles. First-month estimates from Japan’s Famitsu show Sony sold around 213,000 PlayStation 5 consoles in the country, while the top three titles sold less than 63,000, excluding digital downloads. Sony’s Spider-Man and Demon’s Souls were the top games, while the third was an outside software company. For comparison, Nintendo sold a half million Switch consoles in its first four weeks on the domestic market, and the top three titles accounted for roughly the same number.

“Even if we consider digital download software purchases, the percentage of sold PlayStation 5s actually in use is not that high, meaning the current demand is constrained by profit-taking resellers,” said Hideki Yasuda, analyst at Ace Research Institute. The PS5 is compatible with PlayStation 4 game and comes with Astro’s Playroom pre-installed, so players may not be immediately compelled to buy new titles.

Sony’s scalper headaches are aggravated by struggles in production. The company has said it aims to sell more than 7.6 million PlayStation 5s by the end of March, beating the previous-generation console’s performance.

But the pandemic has created shortages throughout the industry’s supply chain, crimping the ability of companies from Sony to Apple Inc. to ramp up output. Key suppliers, including MediaTek Inc., have said chip availability will be constrained through the first half of 2021. Strong demand from electric-vehicle makers, among others, has been consuming capacity for some parts used in the PS5, according to people familiar with its supply chain.

Of particular concern for Sony, production yields for the PS5’s main, custom-designed processor remain inconsistent and have hurt its ability to meet demand, said the people, asking not to be named because the details are private. The company may have to rely more on air freight to deliver consoles to retailers, cutting further into its profits, they said.

“By air is at least 10 times more expensive than by sea when the world is in a normal condition, and the gap is likely wider now,” said Yasuda of Ace Research.

Sony’s latest shipment forecast is still well above the 7.6 million mark, although not as high as it had targeted earlier, one of the people said.

Sony declined to comment specifically on production figures or scalpers.

“While we do not release details related to manufacturing, nothing unexpected has happened since PlayStation 5 mass production has started and we have not changed the production number for PS5,” a spokesman said.

Inadequate supply risks derailing the cycle of a successful console introduction, with new software titles that in turn catalyze hardware interest. One major Japanese publisher was sufficiently spooked by the early market response that it’s held internal discussions over whether to delay its PlayStation 5 games, according to a person familiar with the talks.

Retailers are taking extreme measures to stymie scalpers. GameStop Corp. didn’t tell its own staff about new console shipments to U.S. stores this week until an hour before arrival so real customers could buy them. In Japan, Nojima Corp. had workers manually review every purchase order to screen out scalpers. Yet resellers have already made about $35 million off of PlayStation and $24 million from the rival Xbox that launched at the same time, according to one estimate.

Many customers blame Sony for not doing more to boost supply -- and eliminate profits for scalpers.

“The real test for the PlayStation 5 is whether the hardware would continue to sell well even when there’s enough supply,” said games industry consultant Serkan Toto. “You need good games to convince gamers to switch over to the PlayStation 5, you need more outside publishers to release games on the PlayStation 5, and you need to ship more hardware.”

COVID-19 has pivoted the way we do business today. Data centers have helped transformed digital commerce and online businesses giving digital infrastructure a vital role in business operation and growth. What are data centers? A data center is a centralized facility that houses storage systems, routers, servers, security devices, and electrical switches where data can be accessed virtually thru applications and websites. As money is deposited in a bank, data is stored in a data center. Data centers are not only repositories but also the ones that process, back up, and recover a large amount of data.

What's the best type of data center for your use? The most common data centers are colocation, cloud, and hyperscale. Colocation data centers provide physical space, power, and cooling systems for servers and connections to local communication networks. Some of the most reliable colocation data center companies are QTS Realty Trust Inc (NYSE: QTS), Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), and Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX). Cloud data center, on the other hand, is a host of different companies in one facility such as IBM Cloud (NYSE: IBM). Go ahead and check our previous article about the 15 biggest cloud computing companies in the world. On the contrary, a hyperscale data center is a facility that is run by the company that it supports. The e-commerce giant Amazon has Amazon Web Services. Other most popular data center giants are Microsoft and Google to name a few. Green data centers are gaining popularity as well for promoting sustainability for maximizing energy efficiency while minimizing the environmental effects of a traditional data center. Some of the green data centers you may know are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) wherein they were able to reduce the number of backup generators because of locally generated hydroelectricity on their site in Lulea, Sweden. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the other hand utilizes solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal resources to support their cloud services and operations. According to a recent study of Technavio, the hyperscale market alone expects a compound annual growth rate of 21% from 2020 to 2024 even with the impact of COVID-19. The construction of green data centers in North America accounts for the positive growth rate during the forecasted period.

Story continues DLR Most Expensive Computers In the World

The data center industry is booming with the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), 5g network, and industry 4.0. Digital commerce stores and business owners are relying on the largest data center companies in the world as they provide big data analytics that enhances efficiency, security, and productivity of daily operations. The global data center market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 2% from 2019 to 2025. According to a recent report from Research and Markets, in the U.S. market alone, the data center industry is expected to reach over $69 billion in revenues by 2024. This is due to the most prominent investment in colocation and hyperscale data centers wherein the use of cloud computing services and applications continues to improve rapidly in the U.S.

Today, data centers are improved efficiently to support the growing demand as new applications for technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine advancement continues to grow, so do the needs for a more advanced facility, storage, and equipment that can transmit and process data. This is where the cloud partner ecosystem such as Google Cloud comes in where large data centers are interconnected and collaboratively support each other to create a larger-scale data center.

335,2020-12-15T19:42:46+00:00,20 stocks ripe to surge in 2021 because of 3 big tech trends: analyst,"Per the usual, it has been a year of twists and turns for the tech sector.

Companies such as Zoom (Yahoo Finance Company of the Year) and Slack (which will soon be part of Salesforce) have become household names and vital communication tools with people stuck inside during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for notebook computers has gone through the roof with employees working from home, benefiting companies like Dell and HP. The shift to the cloud has only accelerated this year in large part because of the health crisis, lifting the financial fortunes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

And of course, a year of tech wouldn’t be a year of tech if lawmakers weren’t attacking the powers of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon (notably the two former names).

Tech watchers on Wall Street expect a lot of the same trends that lifted the bottom lines — and stock prices — of so many companies to remain intact for 2021. But Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin says three tech trends in particular stand out as potential money-making opportunities even with valuations looking rich.

“Despite increasing risk of a cyclical rotation pressuring tech multiples next year, we remain bullish on the 3-5 year growth prospects for digital darlings. We have a positive bias on software and internet entering 2021 but would not sleep on semiconductors that could have a banner year,” Bracelin wrote in a new note.

Here are three of Bracelin’s key tech trends and potential stock winners.

Theme 1: Digital awakening

Winners: Lemonade; Twilio; Unity Software; nCino; Avalara; Chegg; Zoominfo; Asana, Slack

Bracelin thinks the ongoing shift to the cloud will be a strong growth driver for numerous tech companies next year. He believes enterprises are having a “digital awakening,” as executives realize they haven’t spent enough on the cloud in the lead-up to the pandemic and must now play catch up in order to satisfy new demands in the business.

“The first and most significant thematic that was reinforced by our latest CIO survey was the premise that cloud and digital adoption at 10% of enterprise and 15% of consumer spend entering 2020 would continue to accelerate post pandemic into 2021-2022,” he wrote.

“A key dynamic playing out in the tech world over the next 12 to 18 months is the secular growth areas around cloud and cybersecurity that are seeing eye popping demand trends we have not witnessed in our 20+ years of covering tech stocks on the Street. The accelerated path to the cloud and work from home environment is unprecedented as enterprises and governments of all shapes and sizes adjust to a more virtual workforce for the foreseeable future,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says.

Theme 2: Cloud plus pay

Winners: Bill.com Holdings; BigCommerce Holdings; Shopify; Coupa Software; Tyler Technologies; Ceridian; Intuit; Workday

The digital payments shift is moving beyond the consumer-focused names such as PayPal to enterprises, Bracelin contends. That opens the door for more tech companies to participate in the digital flow of transactions. Bracelin calls this the ‘cloud plus pay’ investing theme.

“The second biggest thematic we are focused on is the rise of business-to-business payments. We see a new class of software-as-a-service models proliferating in 2021 that augment high margin subscription revenue base with new digital payment streams that can help accelerate growth and profitability,” Bracelin says.

The CEO of Intuit (one of Bracelin’s winners) Sasan Goodarzi recently struck an upbeat tone on his business headed into 2021 in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, fueled in part by its $8.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma. It looks like Bracelin may be on the mark, at least when it comes to Intuit.

Theme 3: Digital exhaust

Winners: Snowflake; MongoDB; Alteryx

Bracelin’s “digital exhaust” theme is probably the most emerging one of the three he discusses. But, the underlying drivers of the theme partially explains the impressive response to data cloud play Snowflake’s IPO this year.

“The third thematic that we’re focused on is a byproduct of the accelerating shift to digital and cloud, which is digital exhaust. The vast majority of information created (97%) has historically been stored, processed, or archived. As new mountains of digital exhaust are created, we expect AI will have an increasingly critical role and an entirely new crop of digital disruptors that help convert digital exhaust into actionable insights in real-time,” explains Bracelin.

To this end, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman recently told Yahoo Finance Live his emerging technology is now mission critical for businesses.

“Snowflake is 100% essential, and I am not just saying that because we are Snowflake,” Slootman told Yahoo Finance Live. “If you look at the history of cloud computing, the data later is crucial and essential.”

339,2020-12-15T09:56:35+00:00,Apple Push Into India Dealt Setback as Protest Turns Violent,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s effort to expand the manufacturing of its products in India ran into trouble after workers at a supplier’s plant rioted over unpaid wages, with many arrested for violence and vandalism.

Hundreds of workers stormed Wistron Corp.’s facility in the southern city of Kolar over the weekend, damaging the property and looting thousands of iPhones and laptops, according to local media. More than 150 people were arrested, the Times of India reported.

Wistron estimated damages at as much as NT$200 million ($7.1 million) and said it’s doing its best to resume operations at the factory. The Taiwan-based company has said the protesters are not its own workers, suggesting they may have been hired by employment agencies, though it’s not clear who is responsible for paying them. Shares fell as much as 3.4%.

“There should be limited fundamental impact in 2020,” analysts Howard Kao and Sharon Shih at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note. “However, we plan to monitor the situation closely – key factors will be the length of the production halt, possible changes in Wistron’s relationship with Apple after this incident, and the progress of Wistron’s Phase II capacity expansion.”

The clash is part of a broader geopolitical challenge for Apple, the most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of $2 trillion. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has long had its iPhones and iPads made in China by contractors such as Wistron and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., but the political tensions between China and the U.S. have raised the risks of dependence on a single production base.

Apple’s Globalization Plans Meet a Baton Charge: Tim Culpan

In addition, India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has pushed policies to build its own manufacturing base, aimed at creating good-paying jobs for workers. This year, Apple’s iPhone assemblers were among the companies on track to win approval to participate in a $6.6 billion stimulus program, Bloomberg News reported.

“Apple needs India,” said Navkendar Singh, a research director at IDC. “India needs Apple to showcase to the world that if Apple can make things here so can others.”

Meanwhile, another Apple supplier, Pegatron Corp., said it will start its India plant on schedule in 2021.

The protests at Wistron were sparked Dec. 12 as workers stormed the facility because they hadn’t been paid, according to the media reports. So many people were arrested that they overwhelmed Kolar’s jail and some were sent elsewhere, the local superintendent of police said.

Apple has said it is investigating the incident and whether Wistron adhered to its labor practices. It sent staff and auditors to the site, in cooperation with the local police.

Wistron said in its own statement that it’s committed to following and implementing all local labor regulations, and will resume production as soon as possible to protect employees’ right to work.

“The government and Wistron management are working in coordination” to investigate the incident, Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s minister for electronics, information technology and communications said in a statement. “Aberrations like this are unfortunate.”

The Morgan Stanley analysts wrote the immediate impact for Apple is likely to be negligible because the Kolar complex had started up only in past months with a capacity for just 5 to 10 million iPhones yearly. It is Wistron’s second production site in the country and handles older phones, rather than the latest iPhone 12, they wrote. But the incident could affect the Taiwanese assembler’s relationship with Apple, which has shown greater willingness to clamp down on labor violations at its hundreds of suppliers.

In China -- where Apple suppliers are among the country’s largest private employers with upwards of a million people assembling gear from iPhones to Macs -- state media wasted no time in highlighting the troubles in India.

“This is a potential risk when manufacturers consider moving their production lines out of #China where they have most stable labor market supporting the nation to become the largest manufacturing hub,” one reporter at the country’s Global Times said on Twitter.

340,2020-12-15T09:56:35+00:00,Apple Push Into India Dealt Setback as Protest Turns Violent,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s effort to expand the manufacturing of its products in India ran into trouble after workers at a supplier’s plant rioted over unpaid wages, with many arrested for violence and vandalism.

Hundreds of workers stormed Wistron Corp.’s facility in the southern city of Kolar over the weekend, damaging the property and looting thousands of iPhones and laptops, according to local media. More than 150 people were arrested, the Times of India reported.

Wistron estimated damages at as much as NT$200 million ($7.1 million) and said it’s doing its best to resume operations at the factory. The Taiwan-based company has said the protesters are not its own workers, suggesting they may have been hired by employment agencies, though it’s not clear who is responsible for paying them. Shares fell as much as 3.4%.

“There should be limited fundamental impact in 2020,” analysts Howard Kao and Sharon Shih at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note. “However, we plan to monitor the situation closely – key factors will be the length of the production halt, possible changes in Wistron’s relationship with Apple after this incident, and the progress of Wistron’s Phase II capacity expansion.”

The clash is part of a broader geopolitical challenge for Apple, the most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of $2 trillion. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has long had its iPhones and iPads made in China by contractors such as Wistron and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., but the political tensions between China and the U.S. have raised the risks of dependence on a single production base.

In addition, India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has pushed policies to build its own manufacturing base, aimed at creating good-paying jobs for workers. This year, Apple’s iPhone assemblers were among the companies on track to win approval to participate in a $6.6 billion stimulus program, Bloomberg News reported.

What Happened: The manufacturing unit of the Taiwanese firm did not suffer damages to the extent reported. The company had estimated damages to the tune of $60 million in a police report, according to Reuters.

Wistron reportedly told the Taiwan Stock Exchange on Tuesday that major production facilities and warehouses did not suffer serious damage and it estimated the losses to be between $3.5 million and $7.1 million (NTD 100-200 million).

Meanwhile, Apple said Monday it was investigating if Wistron was in violation of its supplier guidelines.

The Tim Cook-led company is dispatching staff and auditors to the site and is cooperating with the local police in its investigation.

Why It Matters: The Wistron facility came under attack by workers who claim they were brutally exploited.

Last month, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant had put another Taiwanese supplier — Pegatron Corporation — on probation after it uncovered cases of labor law violations.

Chinese employees of Apple on the mainland have alleged that the company is complicit in the violation of the country’s labor laws.

Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 0.5% lower at $121.78 on Monday.

Thousands of contract workers gathered on the grounds of the Wistron site on the outskirts of India's tech hub of Bengaluru on Saturday demanding unpaid wages and better working hours.

As police arrived, the crowd turned violent and video from the scene showed people armed with rods and sticks smashing equipment and vandalising cars. In a police report seen by Reuters, Wistron estimated damages worth $60 million.

However, in a statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange on Tuesday, the company said major production facilities and warehouses had not suffered as serious damage as reported by local media, and that it was initially estimating losses at T$100-200 million.

The company is doing its utmost to get the plant back up and running, it said. Wistron shares fell around 2.5% in early Asia trade, underperforming Taiwan's broader stock market.

""The company has cooperated with the relevant authorities and the police investigation and continues to negotiate with the insurance company,"" Wistron added, without elaborating.

345,2020-12-14T22:00:19+00:00,Apple's Globalization Plans Meet a Baton Charge in India,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For more than a decade, companies like Apple Inc. have entertained the idea of evolving away from China-based supply chains to have their devices made in lower-cost locales like India, Vietnam and Mexico.

The challenge of such decentralization became brutally evident last weekend with an uprising at a factory operated by Taiwan’s Wistron Corp. that makes iPhones in India. Workers at the plant in Narasapura, 40 miles from the tech hub of Bengaluru, were reported to be fed up with delayed and underpaid wages and ransacked the factory, destroying equipment and burning vehicles.

Local police responded by swinging lathis — long batons that are used for crowd control — to quell the dawn protest. Over 100 people were detained, local authorities were cited as saying. Wistron said Monday that those involved were not company workers, but didn't provide evidence. A Toyota Motor Corp. unit has also had recent trouble in the same state, Karnataka.

Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen ought to be worried.

Cook, who headed operations before taking over the top job, is among global leaders searching for alternatives to the stability and reliability of a Chinese workforce that still makes the lion’s share of the world’s gadgets. But costs there are rising, and this year’s pandemic has highlighted the trade and security risks from having too much of the supply chain in one place.

India is one obvious choice. Its population is almost as large, wages are far lower, and its governments — local and central — are willing to offer incentives to lure manufacturing. New tariffs on imports and requirements imposed on Apple to procure locally have further strengthened the need to produce in India.

Tsai is equally eager to wean Taiwan’s companies off China’s business as her government faces down growing threats from Beijing. India has its own growing list of issues with China, including border clashes this year that led New Delhi to ban apps and other products made by China’s biggest companies. Relations between Taiwan and India have been growing closer.Taiwanese companies have been among the most public supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India campaign. In 2015, Foxconn Technology Group founder Terry Gou dined with Modi during a trip that included an announced plan to invest $2 billion — the iPhone 11 went into production in India this year.

Story continues

Yet the largest investors in Indian electronics production, chiefly Taiwan stalwarts such as Foxconn, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron, are also highly wary of pitfalls. Whereas Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people in China during the peak iPhone season at facilities in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou, it’s less keen to deploy that mega-factory model in India.

The reason is labor.

A senior Foxconn executive once told me that the the company would like to cap India plants at 10,000 workers. Any bigger, and they’d be at the mercy of unions and local politics. A handful of such smaller factories would spread the risk and reduce reliance on any single facility or jurisdiction.

Although labor protests have broken out at electronics manufacturers in China, including the 2012 riots caused by the iPhone “scratchgate” saga, they’re relatively rare given the size of the overall workforce. Central and local governments in China brook no dissent, allowing operations to run relatively smoothly, even at the expense of workers’ rights. Many times, where protests have occurred, they’ve been with the tacit approval of authorities.

But India is democratic. Its unions are vocal, and local politicians have to be responsive. Foreign companies eager to tap the large domestic market and vast labor pool will need to adjust to the reality that workers may be more quick to stand up for their interests. And Cook will need to get used to his company’s name alongside words like riot and uprising. In many respects, it’s unfair to pick on Apple — the latest complaints appear aimed squarely at Wistron — yet the U.S. company is the client and wields the power to force change, something it’s done in China over the past decade.

Tsai also better hope Taiwan’s companies adapt quickly. While she exerts limited control over private firms or their operations overseas, any dispute involving one reflects badly as she seeks to build alliances. She can ill afford to see the Taiwan brand tarnished.

As the world struggles to devolve away from China in a search for supply chain security, political and corporate leaders need to find ways to accommodate a global workforce that wants its own security, too.

347,2020-12-14T12:00:19+00:00,2021’s Must-See Drama: Netflix Under Siege,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When 2020 began and the public didn’t yet know of the coronavirus, the television and entertainment industry was in the midst of a makeshift effort to challenge Netflix Inc., the undisputed leader in streaming. Disney+ and Apple TV+ had just launched, and HBO Max, Peacock and the already dearly departed Quibi were just entering the market. The playbooks were all lacking. The new entrants craved Netflix’s success while resisting how Netflix got there: providing a whole heap of programming unencumbered by a need to support more profitable theatrical or cable-TV businesses.

Then the world changed, and Netflix’s way became the only way.

Streaming was beginning to take over before Covid, but it was playing out in the way a slowly buffering online video does when the connection is strained by too many other devices in use. The industry had other big businesses that needed attention and resources, and it didn’t want to cannibalize them. Then suddenly, all those competing “devices” were shut down, and the focus completely shifted.

Think back to what activities you may have been doing in mid-January. Perhaps grabbing a bite with friends, booking ski vacations or maybe even going to the movies. On the weekend of Jan. 17, 2020, North American theaters sold $62.5 million of tickets to the opening of Sony Pictures’ “Bad Boys for Life,” starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence — not a Marvel superhero smash, but a box-office hit in its own right. The $204 million that it has generated in total so far would have ranked around tenth in a typical year. Instead, the action-comedy threequel — graded 77% on Rotten Tomatoes — is the No. 1 film of 2020, according to data from The Numbers. And it grossed more on that January weekend than the entire box office did in all of November.

Of course, not long after “Bad Boys” hit the big screen, Covid-19 forced theater chains such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the largest in the U.S., to close all locations for what everyone thought would be just a few months, at most. Then a few months became nine. Now they fear permanence. Meanwhile, more than 60 million people have signed up for Disney+, about 30 million for Netflix and nearly 13 million activated the new HBO Max. Netflix has released streaming hit after streaming hit, from “Tiger King” to “The Queen’s Gambit.” And AMC? It warned last week that it will run out of cash by the end of January unless something changes.

Until now, major studios had treaded carefully in their relationships with theater operators because the industry was too important. After all, Disney took a one-third share of the $11.3 billion box office in 2019, while AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., Sony and Comcast Corp.’s Universal split another third. But in the wake of Covid, the companies seem be giving up on cinemas in some ways. Even with a vaccine, theater patronage may never bounce back to the level needed for any entertainment giant to justify prioritizing theaters over streaming. Warner said this month that each film it puts in cinemas next year will immediately become available on the $15-a-month HBO Max app for one month.

Disney is taking a different tack: “Black Widow,” its next Marvel film, will still go to theaters, as will others. But it’s leaning heavily on the lucrative Marvel and Star Wars brands to fuel Disney+ subscriber growth, with 20 new shows from those two franchises alone slated for the next few years. Some of those series probably would have been movies in pre-Covid times. The next Star Wars theatrical film, “Rogue Squadron,” isn’t coming until December 2023.

Both Warner Bros. and Disney’s plans were well-received by their shareholders, despite the price their income statements will pay for these decisions. Disney doesn’t expect any of its streaming apps to begin making money for another couple of years; together they lost $2.8 billion in fiscal 2020. And yet its share have risen 22%, outpacing the S&P 500 index. Theater stocks, on the other hand, have cratered. Cineworld Group Plc — a British operator that acquired U.S. chain Regal in 2018 — has lost 71% in market cap. AMC’s operating losses widened to $675 million last quarter, unable to cover its $94 million of debt interest expense.

The goal for Disney+, HBO Max and the laundry list of other services is to crack lists like Nielsen’s weekly top-10 streaming programs. It tends to look like this — all Netflix, with maybe one show from another service:

It's also not just about amassing hundreds of millions of subscribers paying a monthly fee. (Disney projects at least 300 million by fiscal 2024.) It’s the value of owning the data on all those subscribers. And the elephant in the room is the TV-advertising industry, which is salivating at the opportunity to tap into streaming services (Comcast’s Peacock is already welcoming it). Beyond that, the success of Disney+ and its Star Wars shows, for example, will continue to feed innovations for the theme parks, interest in the cruise ships and purchases of consumer products in the same way Disney’s traditional entertainment businesses have. Think of all the “baby Yoda” sales that came from “The Mandalorian.” For AT&T, CEO John Stankey sees streaming as a way to 2help to keep wireless customers from jumping to other carriers.

When the year began, the financial results for Disney’s streaming operations were relegated to the last section of its quarterly reports — an afterthought to the cable-TV networks, film studios, theme parks, resorts and cruises. The $318 billion company recently reorganized into just two reportable units — Disney Media and Entertainment, and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. The first seems to emphasize streaming above all. CEO Bob Chapek called it a “strategy that puts the consumer in charge.” This was the slide Disney showed investors in explaining the new structure:

Notice where the two people on the left are sitting — not in a theater auditorium, but at home. That may be the most enduring change to come out of 2020. Netflix should enjoy its lonely winter on top, because in 2021 the streaming wars are finally heating up.

BENGALURU, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is probing if its Taiwanese contractor Wistron Corp flouted supplier guidelines at a violence-hit iPhone manufacturing facility near the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, the Economic Times said https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/apple-probing-if-wistron-flouted-its-supplier-rules/articleshow/79713233.cms, citing people familiar with the development.

Over the weekend, several media reports said workers upset about working hours and payments trashed a Wistron factory and about a 100 people were detained.

Wistron is one of Apple's top global suppliers. In India, its makes iPhone 7 and the second generation iPhone SE devices.

Two battery-powered buggies were set on fire, six vehicles were damaged and glass windows and doors of the facility were smashed by iron rod-wielding workers, according to a Times of India report https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/workers-at-iphone-plant-in-kolar-go-on-rampage/articleshow/79700001.cms.

Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Wistron said in a statement it was ""deeply shocked by the incident.""

""The accident was caused by unknown persons bursting in and causing damage to the plant with unclear intentions. The company always abides by the law, and fully supports and is cooperating with relevant authorities and police investigations,"" the company said in a statement to the Taipei Stock Exchange.

Apple's supplier guidelines mandate third-party staffing agencies to pay workers and provide them other benefits as per rules and on time, the Economic Times said, adding it will examine if there was any disparity in wages agreed and paid to the staff.

What Happened: Taiwan-based Wistron Corporation, whose factory near Bengaluru is often showcased by Indian authorities as an example of homegrown manufacturing, saw violence including arson by workers angry over wages and working hours, according to the Journal.

M.D. Harigovind, an official from an Indian union, attributed the agitation to “the brutal exploitation of workers and sweatshop-like conditions.”

Wistron said it was “deeply shocked” by the unrest with a spokesperson reportedly saying “we follow the law and are supporting the authorities with their investigation.”

An Apple spokesperson said the tech giant is “dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with dignity and respect,” the Journal reported. The Cupertino-based company told the Economic Times that it is probing the allegations against Wistron.

Why It Matters: Last month, Apple put another Taiwanese supplier, Pegatron Corporation, on probation after it discovered cases of labor violations.

In mainland China, Apple employees have alleged that the Tim Cook-led company is complicit in the violation of the country’s labor laws.

Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 0.7% lower at $122.41 on Friday and fell 0.11% in the after-hours session.

351,2020-12-11T06:29:32+00:00,"Handed a 5G Lifeline by Trump, Japan Races to Catch Up to Huawei","(Bloomberg) -- When Japan invented the world’s first camera-equipped mobile phone two decades ago, it signaled an early but crucial step in the transformation of the phone into a sophisticated high-speed wireless information terminal.

Two decades later, as the world develops 5G networks that are tens of thousands of times faster, the nation that pioneered many of these technologies has been almost entirely absent. Having lost the lead in consumer-facing handsets after missing the shift to smartphones, Japanese brands have also fallen behind Nokia Oyj, Ericsson AB and above all Huawei Technologies Co. in the buildout of 5G infrastructure.

Those three manufacturers control almost 80% of 5G base-station market share, according to research company TrendForce. But Japanese firms have been handed an unexpected lifeline by the U.S.-led crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese company that was at the forefront of the technology’s rollout. With U.S. partners seeking out suppliers from friendlier nations, vendors in close U.S. ally Japan suddenly seem a lot more attractive to carriers around the world racing to upgrade their networks.

“It’s given us a chance,” Jun Sawada, chief executive officer of Japan’s telecommunications behemoth Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., also known as NTT, said of the U.S. steps to remove Huawei.

The 5G opportunity could help the likes of NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and other network equipment makers make fresh inroads in a global supply chain that’s only set to grow. Recognizing this, the government has also thrown its weight behind the effort, offering hundreds of millions of dollars in support earlier this year to the nation’s few remaining suppliers to build 5G and post-5G technologies.

Since coming to power in September, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s administration has furthered this charge, jumping on the sector as one of its pillars for growth.

“In order to take a global lead in next-generation technology including post-5G and 6G, the government will lead the charge of research and development,” Suga said at a press conference on Friday, announcing more than 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) in spending in an upcoming extra budget for technologies including wireless.

Story continues

Having banned installation of Huawei 5G equipment from next September, the U.K. is already soliciting NEC and Fujitsu, as well as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., to assist with its 5G roll-out. NTT in June agreed to acquire a 5% stake in NEC, partnering to jointly develop 5G technologies.

In a report on U.K. supply chains last month, U.K. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden noted that the decision to remove Huawei would leave the country entirely reliant on just two suppliers, Nokia and Ericsson, to supply critical 5G infrastructure.

“This represents an intolerable resilience risk,” Dowden wrote. The strategy lays out a plan to attract new suppliers and support incumbents so that the nation is “not reliant on any single vendor.”

Shares in NEC have risen about 19% this year, while Fujitsu has added almost 35%, although the gains are largely supported by expectations for their role in Suga’s plans for a digital transformation of Japan’s public sector.

Open Model

Japan’s early attempts to dominate the mobile Internet space failed miserably, with NTT unit NTT Docomo Inc.’s own tightly-controlled I-mode Internet access service unable to catch on in an era of open Internet standards. From Betamax to Blu-Ray, Japanese firms have rarely been associated with promoting open platforms, but are now embracing the concept as they look to cover lost ground amid Huawei’s challenges.

NTT Docomo is one of the founding members of the O-RAN Alliance, a group that is pushing for open radio access networks (RAN) — a crucial part of telecoms infrastructure that connects users’ devices to the broader network.

Traditionally, vendors would supply the RAN and core network together, and as networks became more complex, only the biggest vendors could supply the entire bundle. That advantage accrued for the likes of Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei.

“From the perspective of the carriers, hiring Huawei is easy,” explains Sawada, who spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this year. “They’ll do everything for you.”

He likened this vertically-integrated approach to that taken by Apple Inc. as compared to Microsoft in PCs or Google in smartphones. The open model aims to break this down and provides opportunities to smaller makers.

“The concept of O-RAN is fine, but Nokia and Ericsson won’t simply stay quiet and stand by,” said Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities Co. “They may come after the O-RAN alliance with price cuts.”

‘Big Chance’

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has campaigned against Huawei’s involvement in 5G networks since 2018, urging its allies to boycott the company’s 5G equipment. Japan has a harder needle to thread than some others, dependent on the U.S. for its national security but also seeking to improve relations with its top trading partner. It’s a tension that Sawada acknowledges.

“China and the U.S. are both strong countries,” he said. “The worst thing that could happen for Japan is for them to work together.”

Rakuten Inc., the Japanese e-commerce giant that is building out its mobile phone network in Japan to challenge the long-term incumbents, has embraced O-RAN for its 4G and 5G networks. Founder and CEO Hiroshi Mikitani told a conference in November that he aims to export its network technology overseas and sees its value “easily exceeding 1 trillion yen.”

The open model is also seen bolstering the negotiating position of carriers in contracts for 5G network buildouts, with telcos able to choose from a wide range of suppliers. It also provides opportunities to system integration providers, which Japan’s firms excel at.

“Pursuing this open model which increases competition and seeing how much we can gain is a big challenge for us,” said Takahito Tokita, Fujitsu’s CEO. Earlier this year, Fujitsu sealed a deal to sell 5G technology to Dish Network Corp., which is building out its own network having acquired the Boost wireless business from T-Mobile US Inc.

“This is a multitrillion-dollar market,” he told Bloomberg News. “Even a small percentage of that is a big chance for us,” he said, adding that Fujitsu is still no more than a “newborn chick” compared to the likes of Nokia.

Japan’s firms were once spoken of in western circles in a similar way to China’s are now, working too closely with the central government and benefiting from unfair competitive advantages. But much has changed in Japanese business since that first camera phone was rolled out — with its maker Sharp Corp. now itself owned by a Taiwanese firm, something almost unthinkable just a decade ago. The 5G era and beyond could show its firms how to fight larger competitors with a more open approach.

353,2020-12-10T08:38:31+00:00,GlobalWafers Agrees to Buy Siltronic for About $4.5 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s GlobalWafers Co. agreed to acquire German silicon wafer manufacturer Siltronic AG for about 3.75 billion euros ($4.53 billion), yet another deal in a record year for the global semiconductor industry.

GlobalWafers will pay 125 euros a share, a 10% premium to Siltronic’s closing price Nov. 27, the day before public disclosure of acquisition talks, the companies said Wednesday in a statement. The two companies had disclosed earlier they were in discussions, sending shares in both companies surging.

Siltronic’s shares rose 1.2% to 127 euros in early trading on Thursday. GlobalWafer’s shares fell as much as 8.8%.

Siltronic said at the time its executive board considered the offer “attractive and appropriate,” and that its largest shareholder, Wacker Chemie AG, which has a 30.8% stake, is prepared to sell its stake. GlobalWafers has promised not to lay off employees or close any Siltronic site in Germany before the end of 2024, the Taiwanese company’s Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Doris Hsu said Thursday. The two companies currently have 20 factories in 10 countries, she added.

”Siltronic can help bolster GlobalWafers’ capability in 5G, power and Internet of Things,” Hsu said in an interview, adding the deal will also help her company accelerate the development of more advanced, compound-based semiconductor technology.

The companies said they expect the deal to be completed in the second half of 2021. Hsu said GlobalWafers is confident the deal will pass regulatory reviews.

The combined company would be the world’s largest silicon wafer maker by revenue, with a market share of 32% to 35%, said Richard Hsia, an analyst at Fubon Securities Investment Services Co.

The takeover would mark the end of a disposal process from wafers for Wacker Chemie, which began with Siltronic’s public listing in 2015. Wacker at the time retained a majority holding in Siltronic, which it subsequently reduced and now seeks to divest.

Story continues

The proposed deal would be GlobalWafers’ largest ever, and one of the biggest in the chip industry this year as companies look beyond the pandemic to a return to normal business. The offer will also add to a growing number of semiconductor deals this year that’s set to break the high-water mark for chip acquisitions reached in 2016, when $122 billion in transactions were struck. The largest deal of 2016 was SoftBank Group Corp.’s $32 billion purchase of Arm.

Competition in the industry is heating up as companies that were once customers, such as Apple Inc., design their own chips and established players like Nvidia Corp. branch out into new areas.

Headquartered in Munich, Siltronic is a leading manufacturer of silicon wafers used in products such as smartphones, computers, navigation and digital displays. The firm, which has production sites and offices in Germany, the U.S. and other advanced manufacturing countries, had global revenues of about 1.3 billion euros in 2019.

GlobalWafers, majority-owned by Sino-American Silicon Products Inc., reported 2019 revenue of around NT$58 billion ($2 billion) and operating income of NT$18 billion.

Nomura Holdings Inc. advised GlobalWafers and Credit Suisse Group AG worked with Siltronic.

355,2020-12-09T11:00:00+00:00,Corporate America will truly be addressing racial justice when it ‘costs something’: Michael Eric Dyson,"‘Long Time Coming’ author Michael Eric Dyson joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the actions of corporate America in addressing racial inequality.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you about another power center in America, Michael, which kind of concerns our audience maybe more directly, and you alluded to this, which is corporate America. And, you know, this is tricky stuff because people have good intentions here and there is some action, but I'd love to get your assessment of corporate America's responses in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing.

MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: Well, look, it was great in terms of the immediate aftermath. You know, like hey, this is powerful. You know, we got more monies to develop toward people being brought in. We want to be more diverse. We want to see a broader swath of the universe participate. All that stuff is great.

But, you know, when you get down to brass tacks and knuckles, how are you changing your process? Who are your VPs? Who are the people in the room? Who are the people who can green light projects? Who are the people who can have real resources behind your intent to do well?

So at that level, it means you've got to restructure, rejigger what's going on. It can't just be surface or cosmetic. It's got to be more internal. The skeletons, the bones have to be readjusted so that the flesh that is put upon them can look a bit different.

And so corporate America has to ask, how are you making so much money at the expense of these very Black people who are dying and all you're giving back is a small sliver, a small percentage? Because be rest assured what the corporations are doing in response to Black Lives Matter and saying we're going to pledge money is barely anything in compensation for the amounts of money that Black people put into their pockets, right, across the board.

And so that recognition means you got to do a little bit more, whether you're a sports league or whether you are a, you know, financial-services business or whether you're with clothes or shoes or entertainment. Black folk are sustaining you in far higher numbers than you're willing to pay back or give back or recognize in your bottom-line budgets for Black Lives Matter.

So again, Martin Luther King Jr. said, yo, the civil rights bill didn't cost you nothing. Voting rights, that ain't costing you nothing. What I'm asking for now, economic parity, you don't deal with that. And in an aftermath of his death, housing-- the housing fair act-- the fair act for housing passed, right, '68. That cost something. That means you've got to give up your rapacious, you know, individualism or your rapacious corporate practices when it comes to real-estate companies that are redlining and directing Black people towards certain neighborhoods and ripping them off and taking their money without giving them the bang on their buck.

So all that stuff means it costs something. And until it costs you something as corporate America, you really ain't doing anything to make a difference in terms of race in America.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/corporate-america-truly-addressing-racial-110000310.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'BRK-A.US', 'BRK-B.US', 'C-PIC.US', 'C-PJ.US', 'C-PK.US', 'C-PS.US', 'C.US', 'GS-PA.US', 'GS-PD.US', 'GS-PJ.US', 'GS-PK.US', 'GS-PN.US', 'GS.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'HD.US', 'JNJ.US', 'JPM-PC.US', 'JPM-PD.US']","['AMERICA', 'CORPORATE AMERICA', 'MICHAEL ERIC DYSON']","{'polarity': 0.988, 'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.092}"
356,2020-12-07T17:00:12+00:00,Perdue’s Trading Activity Is Less Than It Seems,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- U.S. Senator David Perdue’s finances have come under scrutiny following a New York Times report that the Republican from Georgia made 2,596 stock trades in one term, or almost two every trading day since taking office. There is a reasonable case to be made that federal lawmakers and others in high offices should be prohibited from trading in individual stocks given the range of inside information they are exposed to in their positions and the importance of public trust in government. But in Perdue’s case, a deeper look suggests nothing overtly wrong.

No explicit charge is made by the New York Times, but by mashing together different types of evidence for four unstated charges, the article could leave the casual reader with the impression that Perdue’s trading was ethically dubious, if not illegal. Less seriously, it creates the impression the Stock Act of 2012 that was intended to prevent potential insider trading by members of Congress has failed. Instead, the Stock Act provides the data needed to refute the stealth accusations and would have exposed illicit trading had it existed.

Let’s start with the number of trades: 2,596. The reader is expected to assume that anyone doing that much trading isn’t paying enough attention to Senate work. Perdue could have been checking his phone for quotes when he should have been listening to committee testimony, or studying stock charts when he was supposed to be working on legislation, but there’s no evidence in the numbers to support that suggestion. The number of decisions in this portfolio — as opposed to the number of individual trades — is entirely consistent with a busy professional who devotes only a small fraction of time to overseeing investments.

Consider Apple Inc., whose AAPL ticker symbol shows up first in alphabetical order on a list of equities Perdue traded and is counted in 62 transactions. Perdue acquired what appears to be about $200,000 of Apple shares in 37 transactions from Jan. 27 to April 27 in 2016. Over the next three years, there were 21 transactions that appear to keep the investment at about the $200,000 level—taking profits on price increases and buying back on dips. The position was liquidated in four transactions from April 14 to April 16, 2020.

Story continues

A Perdue spokesman told the Times that his investment advisers “handle the day-to-day decisions of his portfolio,” but assuming Perdue was involved in the Apple decision, the activity suggests that he approved an initial decision to acquire $200,000 worth in small lots, and to maintain that position, plus the 2020 decision to get out of the stock that was part of a general exit from most of his individual stock holdings. That’s two decisions in six years, not 62.

Wasting time day-trading is the least serious of the four insinuations. The most serious is that Perdue used his official powers to help the companies in which he owned shares. The Times mentions six companies, but doesn’t mention that three had negative stock returns over the holding period: Graphic Packaging Holding Co. fell 10%, FireEye Inc. dropped 30% and Devon Energy Corp. plunged 84%. A fourth, Alliant Energy Corp., was up only 3.2%. If Perdue were throwing favors at these stocks, he wasn’t very good at it.

The chart below shows the price of a fifth company identified in the article, BWX Technologies Inc., from the time it was spun off in July 2015. The period Perdue owned shares, and had committee oversight important to the company, began at the end of 2017. The stock had a mixed track record in the period. Moreover, if Perdue could help the stock, why did he sell it only seven months after buying it?

More generally, almost all Perdue’s trading profits came from buying and holding the same large capitalization stocks most stock investors own, and most stock mutual funds hold. While it’s not possible to determine his precise returns from the available data, we can make an educated guess. I think he made about 8% per year on his stock investments over the six years, perhaps as little as 6% or as much as 10%. The S&P 500 Index was up 10.3% per year, and Perdue’s returns seem highly correlated with the benchmark. So it’s pretty hard to argue he was favoring the companies he owned.

The third insinuation is that Perdue traded on information from committee hearings, with Cardlytics Inc. offered as an example. The article leaves out the reason for suspicion, which is that Perdue sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of the stock on Jan. 23, 2020, according to filings. The stock closed that day at $86.82, falling to $27.72 by the end of March as a result of the pandemic.

The decline in Cardlytics’ stock price gives this insinuation the most support of the four. But there are weaknesses. This particular allegation was investigated by the Justice Department, which did not bring charges. That doesn’t mean the sale was innocent, but it suggests there wasn’t strong evidence of illegality. Another problem is the Cardlytics decline was not out of line with its sector, and there was no specific government news that made it worse. If Perdue knew there would be a pandemic crash, he had other stocks in his portfolio that would have been better candidates for sale.

The last unstated allegation is that Perdue traded on illegal inside information from acquaintances, which is both a serious felony and a form of bribery. The evidence here would be Perdue making well-timed short-term trades. Perdue’s short-term trading — the kind that would be suspiciously profitable if he had illegal inside information — mostly lost money. For example, his biggest return was from Apple, with a gain between 150% and 200% by my estimate.(1) But if he had done no short-term trading, merely bought stock on the first day and sold it on the last, he would have made 207%.

Going down the list, I estimate he saw a return between 70% and 100% in Caesar’s Entertainment Inc., when buy-and-hold would have produced 122%; 75% to 110% in Live Nation Entertainment Inc. versus 514% buy-and-hold; and 50% to 70% in USG Corp. versus 73% buy-and-hold. Next on the list, America’s Car-Mart Inc., could be considered suspicious. I estimate he made between 60% and 80%, versus negative 80% for buy-and-hold. But I figure he made less than $10,000, an unlikely amount to risk both insider trading and bribery charges. Overall, there’s just no evidence of profitable short-term trading looking at the overall portfolio. The few good short-term trades are not suspiciously good, and are outweighed by the bad short-term trades.

The only exception is Cardlytics, for which he really did make a great short-term call. But that is weak for the reasons mentioned above. Perdue’s stock trading does not support serious allegations of wrongdoing, with the limited exception of Cardlytics, for which an investigation was appropriate.

Perdue’s portfolio seems an entirely typical one an experienced businessperson or financial executive of his wealth level would run using a professional adviser. There’s no unusual turnover or short-term trading, and no puzzling strategies or decisions. The results are within legal expectations. The only way to make a scandal out of it is to combine insinuations that support different charges, as if it were all part of some coherent conspiracy, and to ignore the numbers.

(1) Because the official trading reports only give ranges for the amounts and have no prices, I can’t compute exact profits. But I know the range of stock prices on the days of trading. Usually, there’s a period of purchases at a reasonably narrow spread of prices, and a period of sales, also with reasonably narrow spreads. So by making some simplifying assumptions, I can come up with estimates of profit and loss.

357,2020-12-07T16:43:30+00:00,"Bob Dylan's Latest Tune Is ‘Hey, Mr. Cash Machine Man’","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It can’t have been a difficult decision for Bob Dylan to sell his songwriting catalog to Universal Music Group. Perhaps the more interesting question is why the record label wanted to pony up several hundred million dollars to buy it.

The logic for Dylan is straightforward. The copyright on his music will expire 70 years after his death, at which point his work will enter the public domain. The older he gets, the closer his catalog is to depreciating in value. Selling now lets the 79-year-old artist realize the portfolio’s worth, which has likely received a new lease of life as online streaming reignites growth in the recording industry. The value of music catalogs has increased accordingly, and just last week, the 72-year-old Fleetwood Mac star Stevie Nicks sold an 80% interest in her copyrights in a deal that valued her catalog at about $100 million.

What’s in it for UMG? Parent company Vivendi SA is planning an initial public offering for the world’s biggest record label next year. The French media conglomerate is therefore in the process of gussying it up to make it as attractive as possible to new investors. Although streaming services such as Spotify Technology SA and Apple Music have reinvigorated the music industry, they’ve also highlighted some of its vulnerabilities.

Digital distribution has made it easier for artists to reach audiences without a record label, which traditionally fronted the studio and marketing costs in return for a slice of future revenue. Cutting through is still a challenge, and a label’s massive marketing budget can help, but the internet has enabled artists such as “Old Town Road” singer Lil Nas X to build a significant following (and gain leverage) before signing to a label.

The shifting power dynamics enabling some artists to negotiate more generous terms have led record labels to place greater emphasis on owning intellectual property — and the reliable income that comes with it.

Story continues

In this case, it’s Dylan’s compositions. When the time comes for UMG’s IPO roadshow, a deep back catalog of recording and publishing rights will let Chief Executive Officer Lucian Grainge paint a more resilient picture of the company’s earnings. The dependable returns promised by Dylan’s oeuvre will no doubt help with that. UMG can meanwhile extend the lifespan of each song better than Dylan or his estate could alone, for instance by encouraging its stable of artists to record cover versions.

The strategy has already been deployed with some success by rival Warner Music Group Corp., which listed shares publicly for the first time in June. In its IPO filing, it was eager to point out that much of its revenue stemmed from “stable and recurring sources such as our music publishing library,” and that “less than 10% of our total revenues depend on artists without established track records.”

Music publishing (the rights to the underlying composition and lyrics) is also more profitable than the rest of the business, with earnings that represent 23% of revenue, compared with the 15% profit margin from recorded music (the performed versions of songs or pieces). It’s the same reason that Spotify has been charging into podcasts: Owning more content outright means it doesn’t have to pay as much in royalties to other parties.

The times may be a-changin’, but Dylan’s tunes will generate an annuity for many years yet.

358,2020-12-07T09:25:00+00:00,"Company of the Year: Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom CFO","Zoom Video Communications CFO Kelly Steckelberg joins Dan Howley to discuss Zoom's success in 2020 and why it was chosen to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

DAN HOWLEY: Do you think that sets you up for a better future, knowing that, you know, you've already IPOed and now you don't have to do the whole scramble where investors look and, you know, they don't see the profitability yet, they don't see the profitability yet, you have to constantly say it's coming?

KELLY STECKELBERG: So from, I think, the day that Zoom was founded, we've taken a very frugal approach. And you know, we think about-- first of all, the capital that we have is not ours. It is our investors'. It belongs to our shareholders, and previously it belonged to the VCs and the early investors in Zoom. And so we always take a very thoughtful approach about how we invest.

And to that, part of our corporate culture and our onboarding is to think about this. So in our offices, for example, on all the screens always running as part of our kind of corporate culture slideshow, there's a slide that says, if you take one minute to think about spending $1 of your own money, take two minutes to think about spending $1 of Zoom's money. So we really want to encourage and empower everyone to be thoughtful about how we invest.

And then, of course, we have a whole process and planning cycle around how we prioritize investments. We really focus on initiatives that drive top line growth. So R&D and sales are always a priority. And then looking at opportunities where we can be really efficient in areas like G&A, where we invest in automation. And thinking about how we can avoid hiring, if possible, by doing things in a more efficient way.

And I can't take credit for that. Like, that is embedded in the company culture. Which is great, because there's no way that I could do that on my own. It's really an effort that's driven in the entire company.

Story continues

DAN HOWLEY: So you guys just announced your Q3 quarter, the 2021 fiscal year, and you saw $770.2 million in revenue. That was an increase of 367% year over year, and earnings per share were $0.99. That was also a massive increase. I guess, when you look at that, and you think long term, the comparables are going to get tough. Naturally, right? You-- you know, that kind of growth is--

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yep, for sure.

DAN HOWLEY: --huge. So how do you then, I guess, temper expectations? Right? Because we saw after the earnings report, people weren't satisfied with the 367% revenue increase, which-- you know, whatever that says. I guess, where do you-- where do you see the ability to temper that kind of expectation going forward, when you've already seen this massive growth throughout the year?

KELLY STECKELBERG: So what we always say internally, first of all, is we can't control the stock price. What we can control is our own execution. So that's what we are really focused on. And thinking about, what does the future look like? And part of that is around, what does the future of work look like? We're spending a lot of time thinking about, you know, remote work trends, this vision and strategy of work anywhere that I believe is really coming, even in a post-pandemic era.

And we innovate. We announced some great innovations in October at Zoomtopia around things like Smart Gallery, which really enhances the face to face communication experience when you have some employees in the office and you have some that are working from different locations. Things like voice commands and remote reception to help keep people safe as we start to move around the world again.

We also have tremendous growth opportunity in Zoom Phone, which is our cloud PBX product that's about a year and a half old now. So very early stages still with that. We see tremendous opportunity with international. International grew over 600% year over year in Q3. So it's growing faster than the US. And with the increased brand awareness that we've seen during this pandemic, it's really opened up markets that would have taken us years and probably millions of marketing dollars to get to. But we're able to go in and hire talent there directly now, which is really exciting.

And then we have other brand new platforms and products that we announced, again, in October, including OnZoom, which is our event hosting platform. And this is creating an opportunity for really the-- the probably million staff-- millions of hosts that are on our platform every day that are running small businesses or doing things like fitness classes, and bringing them together with their attendees on a platform that provides a seamless experience for them.

And it will also serve as a directory of events and a discovery mechanism, so that if you wake up in the morning like, hey, I want to take a fitness class, but here I am in Queens and I can't go outside-- how am I going to do that? You can look at OnZoom and you can find what's available in a time zone that works for you, and very quickly sign up and be in a class.

And so all of those are creating tremendous opportunities for the way that Zoom's going to be integrated in our lives, even when it's safe for us to move around in the world again. And all of those have different aspects of growth opportunities ahead. So we're really excited about the future and what it holds.

DAN HOWLEY: I guess, when you look at-- you know, you talk about how the brand awareness exploded, right? You know, it was a big IPO. A lot of people were looking forward to it. But the average consumer might not have known, right, if they weren't working in an office at that point.

And now, you know, you-- I was talking to my editor about this and, you know, she's-- she mentioned that people don't ask, do you want to get a drink? They go, do you want to-- do you want to Zoom? Yeah, we do that. My wife and I do that with our friends. Do you want to hop on a Zoom? And you know. So, you know, Skype existed. Microsoft Teams was in existence. Google Meet was in existence. So it was hangouts, it was whatever they were calling it at that point. But there were big name competitors.

So how do you kind of explain the way that Zoom went from, you know, known in the enterprise space to this consumer service now, where originally it wasn't necessarily there, and-- and how do you continue to go along with that?

KELLY STECKELBERG: So everything that we do at Zoom is focused on delivering happiness to our customers and our employees. And-- and the way we do that from the customer perspective has really been focusing on ease of use, as well as reliability of the platform. And so you're absolutely right. Before this pandemic, we were really known in the enterprise space and the-- you know, the B2B space, but not nearly as well in the individual or consumer space.

And I think because it's so easy to use, as we saw schools start to adopt it. It's easy enough for a kindergartener to get on and know how to navigate around. It's also simple enough for, you know, grandparents to feel comfortable getting on and reading stories with their grandchildren.

And so I think it was that, combined with the scalability of the platform, that-- that held up and was there and able to serve, you know, really, the millions of new consumers and users that came to our platform in a very quick period of time, is what led to that extreme growth and increase in brand awareness.

Just to give you some perspective on growth, if you look at last December, we were averaging 10 million daily participants. And in the spring, we announced that that had grown to over 300 million daily participants. And so in a very short period of time, we saw a dramatic increase in usage. And I think it's the scalability of the platform that allowed us to do that.

DAN HOWLEY: When-- when you look, you know, at the different types of usage, I mentioned-- mentioned school. We were doing a separate breakout piece on Zoom in education, how, you know, universities had worked with Zoom, and then, you know, now it's K through 12. I think my nephew might use Zoom schools, and he's like three years old. So as you said, it is easy enough for kids to get on there and-- and communicate through it.

My poor parents have to do construction paper turkey hats for Thanksgiving for them, but still, you know, it works. I guess--

KELLY STECKELBERG: How sweet!

DAN HOWLEY: With-- it's-- it's amazing. When you look at the telemedicine industry, that was something, I think, that felt very much still in its infancy until it was forced to grow up real quick, where people were nervous about going to hospitals because they thought they would get sick. And Zoom became something that a lot of people relied on to-- to talk to their doctors. I mean, I use Zoom calls. My-- my parents use Zoom calls for their own checkups.

So I guess how did you see that developing throughout the pandemic? Because that was something that existed beforehand, right?

KELLY STECKELBERG: It did. So we absolutely-- health care has been one of the key verticals that we have focused on for a long time. We support HIPAA compliance in both Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone and of course, that's what's really important to give confidence to health care providers to be able to talk to their clients and their patients and ensure that they're doing it in a very safe, secure, and private way.

And that's what we all want to know, right? That we don't want to ever have to worry about the security of the platform when we're having these really sensitive, important discussions with our health care providers. And that's exactly what Zoom provides. Combined with the ease of use that all, you know, again, all ranges and ages of patients and clients can easily join a meeting.

DAN HOWLEY: Is-- is there anything where you have to talk to insurers, or have you talked to insurers? Is that something that you guys work with? And I guess, are-- are competitors something like Teladoc or Amwell, or do you work with them? How does that work?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah, so our strategy is we're really more of a horizontal platform that supports the need of then the other app developers that want to build on top of it. So for example, we wouldn't talk to the insurers because we're not the one providing the service itself. We're just there to facilitate it so that we make it really easy for a doctor and a patient to come together.

And then, of course, we have our App Marketplace that allows developers then to build specific verticalized apps on top of our horizontal platform.

DAN HOWLEY: So if there's something like a, say, regular generic doctor's appointment, your primary care physician, there may be an app available that would plug into Zoom that they would then use? And then Zoom would be the video platform that they work through.

KELLY STECKELBERG: Exactly right. So maybe they're using one of the apps in the App Marketplace to do things like scheduling. And then that facilitates, you know, everything leading up to the meeting, and then you join the meeting with your health care provider. And then maybe afterwards, there's a follow up for your next appointment or something. But we're really at the core of bringing people together for the meeting itself.

DAN HOWLEY: OK. And I guess, as far as, you know, working at Zoom and what it's been like, I know that you guys obviously had to go on a hiring spree, I'm sure, because the kind of growth kind of necessitates that. But what have you seen, I guess, as far as going from a company that was known in the IT space to a company that's now, you know, a lifeline to a lot of people as far as connecting and staying connected? And how has that impacted employees? Is there, you know, a greater sense of-- of importance put on their own work? And how are they working from home in the same kind of conditions?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah, so we sent our employees home in early March, and the advantage, of course, that we had is that we all live on this technology every day. So we didn't have to adopt to that. You know, March 15, the world changed for us when there started to be this dramatic increase in demand and need for the product.

And first of all, a huge testament to the commitment and sheer will of our Zoom employees, who worked tirelessly for our first couple of months to do everything we could to make sure that every customer and every prospect that wanted Zoom or needed Zoom had access to it.

And as you said, we've hired a lot. We have about a third of our workforce today has been hired during the last nine months, which means they've never stepped foot in an office. They've never met their manager or their teammates in person. And so to ensure that we are able-- you know, our culture is a very important part of Zoom.

And so, to ensure that we've been able to continue that during this time, our People Experience team has come up with a complete virtual onboarding experience, and the leadership team, we've all become more thoughtful and deliberate about connecting with our teams. We're being very thoughtful about boundaries to ensure that we give people, you know, some-- some space. It's really easy, in this work from environment, to have your days extend. So being very thoughtful about that.

One of my favorite-- I always use this example. One of my favorite examples of that is one of our employees taking a Friday off and putting on her Out of Office that she was in a backyard campout with her kids. And I love that. Even though we're not traveling, we all need to make time to spend-- for those experiences. And the leadership team, trying to really lead by example around that.

And you know, we at Zoom-- I think I speak for the entire company-- we are very humbled and proud of the opportunity that we've been given during this time to support connection in the community and try to minimize disruption as much as we can in-- in learning and connected. I love hearing about you and your wife, you know, meeting with your friends, families coming together.

We have heard countless stories of, you know, adoptions and weddings and engagements, bar mitzvahs. And then even end of life ceremonies. And all of those are beautiful experiences that we feel so amazingly proud to be the platform that people have let into their lives to bring them together.

DAN HOWLEY: I guess, you know, when-- when it comes to using Zoom and-- at a certain point, do you-- do you have to tell people how to-- you know, employees how to help with the fatigue of always being on screen or talking to people on screen? How-- how does that kind of balance out?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Well, I think, like all employers around the globe right now, we're all searching for ways to make sure that we are supporting our employees in the best way possible. So a couple of things we've done-- I talked about earlier being very thoughtful about, first, workload. We are hiring as quickly as we can. Again, our employees have done everything they can to support our customers during this time, and we're adding resources where we need as quickly as possible. Really being thoughtful about boundaries.

We're also doing fun things, like we have a-- we have a team at Zoom called the Happy Crew, and the Happy Crew is exactly what it sounds like. They're there to help support in delivering happiness to our employees every day. They've sent out some really cute surprises every month. We had one that was all about setting up your work from home environment with a mug and some exercise bands, things like that, just to make us all more productive and healthy during this time. They sent out one for Diwali and we had an online Diwali celebration, which was amazing. I loved it. It was so beautiful.

So things like that, as well as we did-- we used to have a monthly gym membership allowance that everybody could have. As most gyms are not accessible to people during that time, we've now converted that over to a more broad-based sti-- monthly stipend that people can use for things like food delivery, grocery delivery.

And we've heard from our employees, even that helps. You know, not having to make dinner a couple of times a month is-- really helps relieve the stress, because they're all trying to deal with, you know, teaching their-- their children at the same time they're working full time, at the same time trying to maintain a household. So we're always looking for ways that we can continue to support employees like that.

DAN HOWLEY: And then just finally, I know we had-- we won't be able to speak with Eric, but I just want to, you know, kind of get a sense of him and how he's working. You know, I know he's kind of been focused on the business for day one, probably, obviously. But since it's kind of taken off, that's got to be what you all are doing.

So I guess when you, you know, look at something like that, is it that he is very focused all the time on the business, and how does that kind of communication work? Do you guys work hand in hand as an executive team? What is that kind of relationship like?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah. So we have a couple of modes of communication within the organization. We do-- Eric has a weekly staff meeting where his-- instead of his direct reports, we all come together, and that's where we talk about initiatives, certainly review, like, the forecast every week, things like that, as well as hiring and how that's all going.

And we have-- we leverage our own internal chat product extensively and stay in touch very-- on a day to-- you know, key day to day items on an ongoing basis. I think in general, Eric's passion is certainly around our product, and he is a true visionary who is always thinking about how do we drive the product forward.

And he is also super passionate about our customers as well, and spends a lot of time with customers, listening to them, helping, of course, sell to new prospects. But also just thinking about what is it that we can do to continue delivering happiness to our customers?

And, you know, he really challenged all of us every day to think about every decision that we make at Zoom from the customer or the employee's perspective. And if you keep that in mind, you're going to come to the right decision. If you're doing the right thing for your customers and employees, you're generally doing the right thing for the business.

DAN HOWLEY: How is it, just-- you know, at this-- promise, last one-- when you reach out to customers, you guys have to talk to customers, is it something that's changed since you've gotten so much larger? Is it more difficult to stay in touch, or is it still the same, perhaps, intimate relationship that existed prior?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah, I think what has grown commensurate-- or we're working on having it grow commensurate with the growth in our customer base-- is things like our sales organization, our customer success organization, our technical support team, our sales engineers to ensure that we have the teams that are there to continue to support our customers, ensure that their needs are being met, and also, as you say, stay connected to them.

You know, it-- we're-- we're playing catch-up for sure, as we saw such a dramatic increase in our customer base in Q1, Q2, and into Q3, but we are focused on that, and certainly hiring as quickly as possible.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/company-kelly-steckelberg-zoom-cfo-092500654.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'QQQ.US', 'TQQQ.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VZ.US', 'ZM.US']","['DAN HOWLEY', 'ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS']","{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.158}"
359,2020-12-06T22:00:13+00:00,These Two Words Will Strike Fear Into Gadget Makers This Christmas,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Global electronics companies hoping to enjoy a spike in sales during a pandemic-inflicted Christmas need to avoid the one thing that stands in the way of a bonanza: shortages.

The shuttering of factories, a reduction in flights, and rolling lockdowns mean that the robustness of a company’s supply chain will end up being of critical strategic advantage. The list of tech giants looking to mitigate, or leverage, challenges in procuring and delivering products during this shopping season reads like a Who’s Who of global brands.Sony Corp., Nintendo Co., Microsoft Corp., HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Xiaomi Corp. and Apple Inc. are among those facing possible lost sales simply because the companies that supply components, assemble devices, or transport their products across the globe are coping with unprecedented difficulties due to Covid-19.

Two words pinned to the product listing of Sony’s new PlayStation 5 on the Best Buy Co. website on an early December evening reveal the one thing executives must fear: “Sold Out.”

On Amazon.com Inc.’s U.S. site, it was “Currently Unavailable.” A similar story is playing out for Microsoft’s Xbox X/S consoles and Nintendo’s Switch.

Such shortages are particularly galling for Sony and Microsoft, because they come as both companies launch their newest games machines in four years, just in time for the seasonal rush.(1)

A big worry is that shoppers unable to purchase their preferred console may opt for an alternative, and the pain of that lost opportunity may be suffered for years to come through follow-on revenue from games and services. The impact is already being felt, according to research firm SuperData, with sales of digital titles over the Thanksgiving weekend dropping 10% from 2019, despite a captive market of consumers stuck indoors.

Apple isn’t immune, either. The iPhone experienced its latest annual launch in history because the pandemic hit both development and production. That had an immediate impact on the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 26, with no guarantee that consumers will end up buying the new model with so many competing toys now vying for their attention.

Story continues

Rather than merely favoring big suppliers who have more resources, production shortages are offering opportunities to smaller players. Nintendo awarded a coveted contract to Sharp Corp., traditionally a maker of screens, to assemble Switch consoles at a factory in Malaysia, Bloomberg News reported, after months of struggling to make enough units at facilities in China and Vietnam. Sony committed to providing more inventory to retailers ahead of the Christmas rush, without saying where it would get the new machines. It’s likely considering adding another assembler or two to shore up supply amid ongoing shortages that have seen after-market prices climb to almost double the retail value.

As the pandemic drags on, even with vaccines set to roll out in coming months, the costs from this global bottleneck could climb into the billions of dollars. Throughout the most recent earnings season, executives outlined the lost revenue and higher expenses from continued supply congestion. The increased outlays include the need to ship by more expensive air routes instead of by sea to make up lost time, a problem exacerbated by a reduced aviation fleet as passenger flights slow to a trickle. Read About: IPhone Delay Interrupts That Supply Chain RhythmHP, which gets two-thirds of its revenue from personal computers and the rest from printers, just closed out its fiscal 2020 with a 3.6% drop in revenue, the worst in four years. President Enrique Lores told investors that “performance this quarter was more driven by supply chain than by demand.” British chip designer Dialog Semiconductor Plc is expected to post a 15% decline in sales this year, saying last month that it could have shipped 5% to 10% more if not for shortages of chip supplies and testing services.

Dell has also been hit, with a lack of components including chips and displays causing congestion and driving up expenses. But the Round Rock, Texas-based company is hoping to spin that into a win, with Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke telling investors that its “industry-leading global supply chain” gives it a “significant competitive advantages to be the partner of choice.”

The notion that their supply chains provide an edge over rivals has been a common boast in recent months for other companies, including chipmaker STMicroelectronics NV, electronics assembler Flex Ltd., and even Best Buy.

If they’re right, they’ll get through Christmas fine. If not, it’ll be a bleak new year.

(1) There have been minor upgrades in the interim, but these devices can be considered new consoles.

361,2020-12-05T19:52:15+00:00,Analyst: Here's why Warner Bros' HBO Max bombshell won't be the death knell for movies,"On Thursday, Warner Bros. (T) shocked the media landscape by announcing plans to air all of its 2021 movies on HBO Max — the same day the films hit theaters.

Shares of the major theater chains plummeted on the news, as fears rippled across the industry that cinemas aren’t just dying — they’re being “murdered” at the hands of COVID-19 and the at-home streaming boom.

But is it really the end of the industry as we know it? Maybe not quite yet, according to one analyst.

“We don’t think the industry is dead, rather we think [streaming and theaters are] playing very well together,” Macquarie Analyst Chad Beynon told Yahoo Finance.

“If we take a look at the results of 2018 and 2019, movie theater revenue and profits were significant for the five major studios,” Beynon said. He added Disney’s (DIS) box office performance was especially impressive, with over $11 billion generated in 2019.

For platforms like Disney, the movie-going experience “is really the first channel of these later channels like theme parks, characters and at-home content,” he explained.

“So we still think the theater experience and economic model make sense for the studios, especially for the blockbusters,” he added. “I don’t think you’ll be able to replace those revenues and profits in the at-home market alone.”

‘Urgent dialogue’ Just this past week, AMC filed with the SEC to offer 200 million shares in order to raise $844 million to avoid bankruptcy

However, the immediate threat facing theaters is very real, and time is running out for chains like AMC (AMC) to avoid bankruptcy. Just this past week, the company filed with the SEC to offer 200 million shares in order to raise $844 million.

But the filing was quickly overshadowed by WarnerMedia’s announcement, which Beynon said now “adjusts the risks of investing at this point.”

AMC CEO Adam Aron released a statement on Thursday night, saying, “Clearly, WarnerMedia intends to sacrifice a considerable portion of the profitability of its movie studio division, and that of its production partners and filmmakers, to subsidize its HBO Max startup.”

Story continues

He added: “We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business. We have already commenced an immediate and urgent dialogue with the leadership of Warner on this subject.”

In the interim, AMC might have to adjust its post-COVID return as specialized, higher-end experiences could reign supreme.

“I think consumers — particularly in this industry — will pay for service and higher quality and that’s something that IMAX (IMAX) and some of these other players have done well,” Beynon said.

“This whole industry has changed in terms of what’s being offered to the consumer — luxury recliners, food and beverage options — and IMAX is the luxury bar here,” the analyst noted.

“They’re doing well in China and Japan and we’ve seen consumers flock back to those screens because they’re choosing to go there over other products in the market. I think that will be the same case in the U.S.,” he added.

IMAX shares rebounded from its Thursday losses — closing nearly 4% higher at Friday’s close whereas AMC continued to lag in the red, ending the week down over 3%.

“AMC has a mix of higher-end and lower-end products but I do believe when consumers come back and have the opportunity to go to the big screen, they’re going to choose quality and service over anything else,” Beynon concluded.

364,2020-12-04T08:00:30+00:00,Sick of Roaming Fees? Now Your Carrier Is Hurting Too,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed an uncomfortable truth about the telecoms industry: Roaming, that old bugbear of the world traveler, still accounts for a disproportionate amount of profit. It’s an addiction that carriers just aren’t ready to wean themselves off, even as it becomes harder to justify and drives customers to Silicon Valley alternatives.

The 2020 travel hiatus has lost European carriers some 2 billion euros in roaming fees, according to my calculations based on this year’s earnings reports. That might only be about 1% of their total revenue, but in many cases the drop-off has been enough to make the difference between profit growing and shrinking, trimming earnings for some operators by four or five percentage points. It chips away at their contention that new digital tools are making profitability more resilient.

That’s because roaming is significantly more profitable to carriers than standard phone plans. It can generate a more than 50% Ebitda margin, an earnings measure, compared with the typical 35%, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Erhan Gurses estimates.

It’s a particularly lucrative money-spinner for companies active in the tourist hotspots of southern Europe: the likes of Telecom Italia SpA, Vodafone Group Plc, France’s Orange SA and Spain’s Telefonica SA. Roaming can proportionately account for four times as much revenue for those companies as it does for firms in countries that don’t attract quite as many transatlantic visitors, such as Switzerland’s Sunrise Communications AG and Swisscom AG, or Sweden’s Telia Co. AB.

And this money is coming in despite the European Union essentially ending roaming charges in 2017 for those from member countries crossing its borders. An Orange customer in France doesn’t have to pay extra to make a call when in Portugal, for instance. The additional income comes from either non-European visitors or from European customers gallivanting around the rest of the world.

Story continues

A continued penchant for roaming may be shortsighted. The extra fees can push travelers toward alternatives that support wi-fi, such as Apple Inc.’s FaceTime or Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp Audio, which ultimately encourage consumers to form habits that aren’t in the carriers’ long-term interest.

Continuing roaming also risks agitating regulators, who have persistently complained about it being little more than a cash cow. That’s political goodwill carriers can’t afford to lose as they try to push through more mergers.

Individually, none of these factors — the loss of fee revenue, the rise of wi-fi alternatives and an irked antitrust police — is a deal breaker for telecoms. Cumulatively, they present a risk.

Still, intercontinental roaming charges are unlikely to disappear any time soon. U.S. regulators have little incentive to stop AT&T Inc., for example, from charging exorbitant carry fees to a European carrier whose customers are on holiday in Las Vegas or doing business in the Bay Area. The kind of multilateral agreements needed to put an end to the practice would be hard to come by.

For now, carriers need a vaccine rollout for global travel to resume and for roaming fees to help them return to growth. But the impact such a small fraction of their operations has had on earnings is disconcerting.

366,2020-12-01T20:50:40+00:00,Roku Hires Apple’s Chief Siri Architect For Software Role,"(Bloomberg) -- Roku Inc. has hired a Siri executive at Apple Inc. to lead advanced technology development.

Brian Pinkerton has joined the San Jose, California-based maker of TV set-top-boxes and software where he will focus on “technical innovation and strategic software development across the platform,” the company said on Tuesday. His work will be broader than voice control, which was his specialty at Apple, where he was the chief architect of Siri until November, according to his LinkedIn page. Pinkerton was also previously chief technology officer for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

Roku sells several streaming video players to access video content as well as sound bars, but the company has increasingly focused on expanding its software platform and the Roku Channel streaming service. It has also been pushing for its software to be built into lower-end TVs, ceding the high-end to software like LG Electronics Inc.’s webOS and Android TV from Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

Roku recently started rolling out support for Apple’s AirPlay streaming and HomeKit smart home protocols to its TV devices. Last year, Roku became one of the first platforms to feature the Apple TV+ subscription service.

Roku shares were down 2.6% at 3:44 p.m. in New York. They have more than doubled this year while Apple has gained 67%.

(Updates with shares in final paragraph. An earlier version of this story corrected the location of Roku headquarters.)

368,2020-11-28T22:00:00+00:00,Apple Suppliers’ Exodus From China Won’t Slow Down Under Biden,"(Bloomberg) -- The splintering of the global tech supply chain that began during President Donald Trump’s watch looks set to persist under his successor.

Apple Inc., the largest of the many tech giants that rely on Chinese factories to make their gadgets, will move some production of its iPads and MacBooks to Vietnam. Key assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known also as Foxconn, has allocated $270 million in new investments to the Southeast Asian country. Those moves presage a larger and longer-term migration that may have ramifications for the iPhone maker as well as China’s role as workshop to the world.

Foxconn founder Terry Gou coined the term “G2” to describe the trend of a unified supply chain splitting into at least two. Company Chairman Young Liu said in August that the likes of India, Southeast Asia and the Americas could each in the future end up with a dedicated manufacturing ecosystem of their own. The trend now looks irreversible as other countries including India and Vietnam are boosting their infrastructure and efforts to lure manufacturers through lower costs and fewer geopolitical worries.

“As China gets more expensive, and as U.S. politics have been unpredictable, companies have shifted production of some goods out of China. That trend will continue as China gets more expensive and as Vietnam and India improve their competitiveness,” said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.

Trump’s trade hostilities against China caused many manufacturers to shift production capacity to neighboring countries like Vietnam and further afield to sites in Mexico and India, in order to avoid being slapped with punitive tariffs and to mitigate future sanctions risk. Apple, whose Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook orchestrated the creation of its current Chinese-centric production chain, has resisted a large-scale move but in recent years has increasingly explored alternatives.

Story continues

The Cupertino, California-based company is continuing to add iPhone capacity in India through its assembly partners, aided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy to attract top-tier smartphone companies to make their gadgets locally for export. Pegatron Corp., the last of the major iPhone assemblers to arrive in the country, announced earlier this month it is injecting 11 billion rupees ($150 million) into its Indian unit and will start production there as soon as late 2021.

Back at home, the iPhone maker has been lobbying the U.S. government to support local chip production with tax breaks. Its key supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning a chip fab in Arizona, though the modest scale and technology of that facility would suggest it will service smaller customers, at least to begin with.

Beyond Apple, Alphabet Inc.’s Google has placed orders with Foxconn to assemble key components for its servers in Wisconsin, at the under-utilized facility that has to date been most famous for what it hasn’t produced. Mass production there is expected to go ahead in the first quarter. Pegatron officials said earlier this month that the company plans to also set up manufacturing operations in the U.S. to serve other customers.

Wistron Corp., another Taiwanese contract manufacturer that handles iPhone orders as well as laptop and server production for other American customers, announced plans earlier this month to add capacity in Mexico and Taiwan. It’s also buying a Western Digital Corp. factory in Malaysia. Chairman Simon Lin said in March that half of Wistron’s capacity can be located outside of China as soon as 2021, with Vietnam operations ramping up and the company seeing India as a key strategic site for the next decade due to its market size and resources.

Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made products have also forced other international companies to rethink their manufacturing operations. Nintendo Co. now has some of its Switch console production handled by Sharp Corp. in Malaysia, after it asked its main assembly partner Foxconn Technology Co. to offer geographic alternatives to its core China operations. Foxconn Tech, a major entity of the Foxconn Technology Group and a Sharp shareholder, made the connection between the two Japanese firms.

While Apple is diversifying its global supply chain, it’s also deepening its links with local Chinese manufacturers to serve the domestic market. Earlier this year, China’s Luxshare Precision Industry Co. struck a deal to acquire Wistron’s iPhone production facilities in the country, a move that will create the first mainland company to assemble Apple’s marquee handsets. Compatriot BYD Electronic International Co. is also now splitting iPad orders with Foxconn and Compal Electronics Inc., a person familiar with the matter said. AirPods orders, meanwhile, are now dominated by Luxshare and another compatriot, GoerTek Inc.

It took Foxconn 30 years to build up its massive Chinese operations and India or any other region is unlikely to catch up overnight, Foxconn’s Liu said earlier this month.

The supply chain shift will take time, “and China will remain a major electronics manufacturing hub for at least the next five years,” Gavekal’s Wang added.

Maybe not ‘sacred,’ but still important.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed above 30,000 for the first time on Tuesday.

This record close at 30,046.24 comes just less than four years after the index closed above 20,000 for the first time. Nearly 18 years passed between the Dow’s first closes above 10,000 and 20,000.

And it might seem improbable that this milestone comes during a year in which a global pandemic rocked financial markets, tens of millions of jobs were lost in just a few months, the incumbent party lost the White House, and Americans took to the streets to protest racial injustice.

Regular readers of this newsletter will by now be well acquainted with many of the reasons stocks have looked past these challenges facing the country and the global economy right now. Positive vaccine news, Federal Reserve actions, anticipation of an economic rebound in 2021, and low interest rates are just parts of a story those steeped in the market’s daily movements will be familiar with.

None of these catalysts alone, of course, can explain why the market does what it does. But taken together, the idea congeals.

During an extremely brief statement on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said that 30,000 is a “sacred” number for the Dow. And while this is not a descriptor we’ve heard before in reference to the price of a stock market index, it is indeed significant for the Dow to eclipse 30,000 for the first time.

Because while investment professionals will tell you that the S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Russell 1000 (^RUI), or the Wilshire 5000 (^W5000) are better barometers of U.S. equity markets, the public knows the Dow.

Back in 2009, Pew Research asked Americans what they knew about the financial crisis that was rocking the economy at the time. And when it came to financial markets, Pew didn’t ask about the 10-year Treasury yield, the Fed Funds rate, or what the S&P 500 was doing. Pew asked about the level of the Dow.

As an index, the Dow isn’t perfect. And many investors would tell you the index is, in fact, fatally flawed.

The Dow is weighted by the per-share price of its members, not the market capitalization of the companies. Which, when you think about it, really makes no sense. The price of any company’s stock can be any price at any time and says nothing about the actual value of the business. The per-share price is just the result of some simple division.

As a result of this quirk, the Dow today is more impacted by a change in the share price of Goldman Sachs (GS) — which rose 3.95%, or $9.04 per share — than it is by a change in the price of Apple (AAPL) stock, which rose a more modest 1.16%, or $1.32, on Tuesday.

And while Goldman is, of course, a formidable investment bank and one of the financial industry’s defining brands, the company’s market cap is more than 95% smaller than Apple’s.

There also isn’t a whole lot of money indexed to the Dow. When you ask an investor if they’re “beating the market” almost no one will be benchmarking that performance to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The Dow is also comprised of just 30 companies instead of the 500 included in the S&P 500, collecting just a small fraction of the several thousand publicly-traded companies.

But let not these industry technicalities take away from the import of this milestone.

Dow 30,000 will make more people more aware of how the stock market is doing and will inform their view of how the economy is performing.

And for better or worse, that matters a lot more than some financial expert telling you to ignore it.

371,2020-11-25T06:30:00+00:00,South Korea Unveils AI Chip to Maintain Semiconductor Leadership,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea is adding a new artificial intelligence chip to its arsenal of semiconductors as the nation seeks a bigger slice of the global tech market and an upgrade of its industrial capabilities.

The Sapeon X220, unveiled Wednesday by the largest local carrier SK Telecom Co., is designed to speed up servers that cater to a growing number of mobile devices -- from drones to self-driving vehicles -- that perform better with AI. It’s the latest product of the nation’s decade-long push to broaden its dominance beyond memory chips, where Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. control roughly two-thirds of the global market.

South Korea sees data-processing chips as a major engine for future economic growth, along with fifth-generation wireless networks. The government has provided more than 600 billion won ($542 million) in support to develop such chips and plans to invest another trillion won over the next decade, viewing them as crucial in automating factories and improving the competitiveness of the country’s exports.

“As we teamed up with the government, we said, ‘Let’s make AI available and affordable for all of our companies,’” said Lee Jong-min, an SK Telecom vice president overseeing the chip development. “South Korea has the demand, the full stack of tech needed to meet the demand, and the ability to take it to the next level.”

Semiconductors account for about one-fifth of South Korea’s exports, most of them memory chips. The country is now turning to application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, such as the X220, which is tailored for AI operations. It follows a similar $1 billion investment plan announced by the U.S. government this summer, which also emphasized AI and public-private collaboration.

As the first country in the world to roll out commercial 5G last year, South Korea believes it also can lead in adopting and optimizing AI by virtue of the nation’s compact size, wide broadband coverage and smartphone penetration.

Story continues

Competition is heating up in the AI semiconductor space, with the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google investing in their own bespoke server silicon. As more devices than ever come online, companies are betting they can unlock value and insights from the resulting trove of data through machine learning and analysis at scale.

Like SK Telecom, U.S. competitors offer such cloud services to other companies, and the investment in designing the chips makes sense when factoring in the cost of electricity and the chips’ ability to handle greater volumes of data more efficiently.

SK Telecom’s chip, the size of a postage stamp, is the first Korean ASIC for data centers to be commercialized, according to the company. It represents the latest push by the Seoul-based carrier to expand beyond its traditional mobile and broadband businesses and keep up in an era of AI-driven innovation.

The global AI chip market is currently led by Nvidia Corp., a graphics-card giant whose market value has eclipsed that of Intel Corp., the company historically most associated with semiconductor breakthroughs. Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs has spiked in recent years, as the perennially increasing demands of high-resolution video games have been joined by a boom in cryptocurrency mining and other data-intensive applications that benefit from massively parallel processing. Even smartphone processors from the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. now come with dedicated cores for handling AI tasks, and the need for more ASICs like the Sapeon X220 is forecast to rise as artificial intelligence gains more ground in global technology.

372,2020-11-23T12:00:00+00:00,Foxconn Plant Championed by Trump Lands Google Server Contract,"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group plans to assemble key components for Google servers from its plant in Wisconsin, people familiar with the matter said, finally breathing life into a factory Donald Trump hailed as crucial to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

The Taiwanese company has decided to locate production for this new contract at the existing complex rather than make the components at home or in China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive move. The under-utilized factory should start mass production in the first quarter, timed with the release of Intel Corp.’s Ice Lake server chips, they said. Foxconn is setting up surface-mount technology assembly lines that it will use to place semiconductors onto circuit boards, they added.

Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is one of several Taiwanese firms exploring ways to expand in America and lessen a reliance on Chinese production bases. The company has also sought to diversify a business that counts on Apple Inc. for half its revenue, including by courting more American clients. On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. won city-level incentives for a $12 billion chip plant in Phoenix, another step toward bringing high-tech manufacture back to the U.S. and addressing security concerns over the industry’s supply chain.

A Foxconn representative confirmed it’s developing data center infrastructure and high-performance computing “capabilities” in Wisconsin, but declined to name any customers.

Taiwan counts Washington as an essential diplomatic, economic and military ally amid rising tensions with Beijing. Foxconn, which operates most of its factories in central and southern China, won Google’s business because it was the only contract manufacturer capable of establishing a surface-mount technology line on American soil, one of the people said. Shanghai-listed Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., its cloud business unit, will oversee the server business in Wisconsin, another person familiar with Foxconn’s operations said.

Story continues

The plant in Wisconsin was unveiled to much fanfare in 2018 by Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou and Trump, who called it “the Eighth Wonder of the World.” Once envisioned as the centerpiece of a Made in America effort that would create 13,000 jobs for the Badger State, it instead succumbed to delays and switched directions several times after local officials slashed subsidies. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with just 178 full-time employees. And rather than the promised large-sized display panels, it began churning out face masks and ventilators this year.

Yet its location in the heart of America is now a boon to Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is trying to win lucrative contracts for its server-dependent cloud business. The U.S. company considers it an important area for the company’s growth, but one in which Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. dominate. An American base could help Foxconn court U.S. government contracts, particularly as Washington ramps up scrutiny over a largely Chinese-focused global electronics supply chain.

374,2020-11-14T15:31:03+00:00,Analyst: It's 'nearly impossible' for AMC to survive COVID-19 without a strategy shift,"Movie theater chains have suffered massive losses amid the COVID-19 pandemic — and the situation could become much more bleak without more fiscal aid or financial support.

Earlier this week, Pfizer’s positive vaccine news sent entertainment stocks surging as the sector embraced the possibility of a return to a pre-pandemic existence.

But life might not ever return to ‘normal’ for in-person entertainment, and the beaten down industry seems to be running out of time.

AMC (AMC) reported a nearly $1 billion loss in the third quarter, and on Tuesday filed to offer another 20 million shares. The obvious objective is to keep the company afloat, as the threat of bankruptcy looms with COVID-19 cases continuing to surge across the country.

“I think it’s going to be near impossible for [AMC] to last without doing something else,” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon told Yahoo Finance. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - AUGUST 20: Joey Walsh sanitizes the concession stand at AMC Town Square 18 on August 20, 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

“To get through this, [AMC will] have to do something from a portfolio trimming and asset monetization standpoint,” he explained, referring to a strategy that may involve selling off properties, or at least finding ways to make them generate cash.

“They have roughly $400 million in cash right now but [they’re] burning $100 million a month,” Beynon added.

“That gets them into this February, March time period — which is pretty close to when most people think consumers will get out, so really the only way [to minimize that bankruptcy risk] is to do something with their portfolio,” he continued.

‘Praying there won’t be more delays’ Movie delays due to COVID-19

Since April, AMC has raised roughly a billion dollars “to essentially stay afloat,” Beynon said. Still, it’s been difficult for the theater chain to attract consumers amid increased film delays.

Highly anticipated tentpoles like Marvel’s “Black Widow,” MGM’s “No Time To Die,” and WB’s “Dune” have all delayed their release dates to 2021.

So far, the only big blockbuster left in 2020 is “Wonder Woman: 1984,” which is still on track for a December 25, 2020 debut although it seems unlikely that that date will stick.

Story continues

On Friday, reports emerged that Warner Bros. executives are debating the film’s release strategy — mulling either a January HBO Max (T) release, or a possible delay to summer 2021.

“Those blockbuster movies that generate about $100 million domestically, they account for about 60% of the box office in the U.S., so they're critical to keeping these businesses afloat,” Beynon told Yahoo Finance.

“The problem with this is the theaters are open. They're waiting for the content, and they're just sitting and praying that there won't be more delays,” he added.

In the interim, theaters are rolling out on innovative alternates to help offset costs. On Tuesday, AMC announced it will launch a program where anyone can privately rent out a movie theater. That followed a four-week trial where the theater chain said it received over 110,000 requests across the country.

Prices begin at $99 and include tickets for up to 20 people. Meanwhile, newly-released film like Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” are a bit pricier — with costs ranging from $149 and $349.

“Certainly desperate times call for desperate measures. AMC has done their part in terms of sanitizing the theaters and doing everything they can do for the consumers to come in and they just have not come,” Beynon said.

“I don’t think it’s going to do much from a cash flow perspective, but it can certainly get people back to theaters, which is what they need,” he continued.

ANDY SERWER: So as we go in to the Biden era, I'm curious as to what you think the direction and tenor of Washington, DC's desire to, perhaps, rein in or regulate the big-tech platforms, what path that's going to take. Because it's-- it's not at all clear cut. You've got Ted Cruz, David Cicilline, now Joe Biden, Sen. Warner, people with very different political perspectives, who seem to share distrust and anxiety about the platforms. But that's where the common ground ends, right?

REID HOFFMAN: Yeah. So look, roughly speaking, I'm-- this is not a no-regulation point of view. But I am a very strong believer that we've now moved to a multi-polar world. China will be building more and more of the technology platforms that matter in the coming years. And actually, to some degree, I hope that there's other places. Like I-- you know, one of the Greylock investments we have is this incubator called Entrepreneur First, which is building tech communities in Europe and in Singapore.

So you know, I hope for-- for more of this. But what that means is you don't disable your own player, right? You don't go hey, let's try to do that. What you want to do is you want to shape them.

You want to say, look, these outcomes, misinformation. Here is our social mandate for how we change that. So we have more truth in the media ecosystem. You know, those kinds of things are important.

But, like, the classic notion of an antitrust or breakup, I think those are, generally speaking, going to be actually, in fact, a counter American health and prosperity. And by the way, I say that as my primary thing as an investor, as new startups, as competing with these large tech companies. So this not like an embodied interest.

But actually, in fact, I think we're-- we have maybe five tech giants today. I think, you know, five years from now, we're going to have 10 tech giants. And those competition between those tech giants is what create lots of space for startups to either, you know, get their initial base, or to grow into being the 11th, or to be bought by one of them. And so that's part of the reason why I think actually, in fact, the-- the antitrust isn't the right thing. But figuring out how to contribute the right way to the health of-- of our society, and global society, is the right thing.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Two questions here. So first of all, when you're talking about going from five to 10, are you talking about the other five being in China? And then, also, what specifically, though, short of anti-trust and breaking things up, would be your remedies?

REID HOFFMAN: So-- so, on the first, actually, in fact, if you're including China, you're like five going to 25. Right? So, it is much larger.

I was actually just talking about, you know, the-- the kind of the growth of companies like, you know, Airbnb and others as they-- as they establish, you know, on the stage. And obviously, you know, there's a bunch right now around, like, Netflix and Salesforce and other kinds of things. So I think there's a range of these-- these companies have become multipart technology platforms. And with China, you're going to see a ton more.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/linkedin-co-founder-number-tech-140000446.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'EBAY.US', 'FB.US', 'FDX.US', 'FTEC.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'ORCL.US', 'PPL.US', 'QCLN.US', 'RYT.US', 'SNAP.US', 'TWTR.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VGT.US', 'VITAX.US', 'XLK.US', 'XSD.US']","['ANDY SERWER', 'BIDEN', 'TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS']","{'polarity': 0.987, 'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.083}"
377,2020-11-11T16:18:37+00:00,Alibaba Singles’ Day Ends Strongly as Beijing Crackdown Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. posted sales of $75 billion during the world’s largest shopping binge, wrapping up an annual frenzy of Chinese consumption that this year was overshadowed by escalating regulatory scrutiny over the country’s giant internet sector.

Sales during the Singles’ Day festival totaled 498.2 billion yuan at the end of Nov. 11, easily surpassing 2019’s $38 billion official tally after Alibaba added several days and additional services to the count for the first time. Unlike past years, Alibaba didn’t provide detailed breakdowns about what got sold apart from tidbits like the fact its Tmall platform logged 583,000 orders in one second at its peak.

Investors watched Alibaba’s bargains bonanza for signs that Chinese consumers were raring to fire up the country’s post-pandemic recovery. But the headline numbers took a backseat to concerns that regulators are seeking to curtail the growing influence of Alibaba and other Chinese internet leaders. Shares of Alibaba, the largest of the country’s tech firms, plunged 9.8% in Hong Kong Wednesday, taking losses to more than $115 billion since Beijing this week unveiled new antitrust regulations governing the sector’s dominant players.

Singles’ Day debuted in 2009 and has grown over a decade into a nationwide marathon of frantic bargain-hunting that dwarfs sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday in both intensity and size. 2020’s edition features a record number of brand names from Apple to Nike betting that -- after months of Covid-enforced abstention -- China’s 400 million-strong middle class is ready to spend on everything from Hainan beach-side vacations to takeaway coupons and electronics.

Alibaba has been benefiting after the pandemic forced Chinese consumers -- who already buy about 30% of the nation’s retail purchases online -- to accelerate their shift to e-commerce. Homebound consumers turned grocery delivery into the industry’s hottest arena, anchoring an unprecedented surge in online activity during the nationwide lockdown. Domestic travel is accelerating, propping up Alibaba businesses such as Fliggy, while a raft of new smartphones launched during the quarter is expected to tap pent-up demand for electronics.

“We are seeing Chinese customers releasing the strong consumption demand during the event,” Liu Bo, general manager of Tmall marketing and operations. Core consumers, the country’s middle class, have demonstrated a solid appetite for shopping as a way to compensate for not being able to travel overseas, he added.

The strong start to this year’s sales fiesta -- also known as “Double 11” -- may bode well for China’s economy, providing further evidence that consumer spending, so far a laggard in the recovery, is strengthening.

“Double 11 has historically served as a very accurate indicator for what’s happening in the following year for retailers, brands as well as consumers,” said Jonathan Cheng, head of China retail at Bain & Co. “For this year, with Covid, it’ll become more important. And if you look at China, which is the first one to be coming out of Covid, it’s gonna be an indicator for other countries as well.”

The brainchild of co-founder Jack Ma and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, Single’s Day was intended to be an antidote to the sentimentality of Valentine’s Day. It takes its name from the way the day is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached. Along the way, the company created the world’s largest shopping festival that has helped to propel Alibaba into a Goliath.

It’s also become an annual showcase for Alibaba’s cloud services as well as affiliate Ant Group Co.’s Alipay mobile wallet. A record event would be another feather in the cap for Ant, which could do with a win after tightening regulatory scrutiny that torpedoed its initial public offering last week.

Livestream Gala

In a nod to the pandemic, Alibaba scaled back on live events this year and is instead relying on increased online promotions such as celebrity livestreams to draw hundreds of millions of shoppers to its e-commerce platforms. Pop star Katy Perry performed at an online event Tuesday, four years after she pulled out from Alibaba’s annual live extravaganza to mark the shopping festival. Alongside the usual 24-hour sales period on Wednesday, 2020’s event featured an additional window for consumers to make purchases from Nov. 1-3.

Shoppers can purchase heavily discounted goods like cosmetics, clothing and groceries from its Taobao and Tmall platforms and have them shipped via the company’s Cainiao logistics service, and book flights to domestic tourist hotspots on the Fliggy travel website. Kaola -- purchased from NetEase Inc. last year -- is participating for the first time, offering goods from 89 countries to consumers.

Foreign consumer brands have long relied on Alibaba to gain access to the Chinese middle class. That’s especially true this year, given how most economies elsewhere are grappling with a resurgence in the pandemic. During the first 111 minutes of sales on Nov. 1, Nike Inc. and Apple Inc. were among 100 brands that reported 100 million yuan ($15 million) in transactions. And Estee Lauder’s flagship store on Alibaba’s Tmall platform was the first to surpass 1 billion yuan in sales, the e-commerce company said. International hotel groups Marriott International Inc. and Accor SA also passed the 1 billion yuan transaction mark for the first time.

Sales Discounts

Expectations are high for Alibaba. Revenue in the September quarter grew at the slowest on record for the period, with customers putting off purchases on its Taobao and Tmall platforms in anticipation of deep bargains ahead. “The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch.

As with previous years, Alibaba and its e-commerce rivals rolled out ever-larger promotions to entice consumers. Over the entire Single’s Day event, merchants could end up forking over a record 30 billion yuan in discounts and subsidies to goose sales across Tmall and Taobao alone, CLSA Ltd. analysts led by Elinor Leung estimated.

Those discounts may be the key to enticing consumers, which have only just started to loosen their purse-strings, to keep spending. China’s retail sales climbed 3.3% in September from a year ago and growth may have accelerated to 5% in October, as travel and other consumption picked up during the golden week holiday at the start of the month.

But overall retail sales are still down for the year -- shrinking about 7% in the first nine months from the same period in 2019 -- and it remains to be seen if strong spending during national holidays and one-off shopping events like Singles’ Day will translate into a sustained recovery. Private consumption accounted for no more than 0.5 percentage point of GDP growth in the third quarter and a full recovery in consumer confidence may only come in 2021, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group economist Xing Zhaopeng.

“Singles’ Day should see spending higher than a year ago but keep in mind retail sales were growing at 8% before Covid-19,” said Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. “If Singles’ Day is much better than expected, we should watch sales activity closely in December to see if this is a genuine pick-up or consumers are simply stocking up and staying cautious.”

379,2020-11-11T15:03:45+00:00,How Singles' Day compares to Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day,"Alibaba’s (BABA) Singles’ Day has quickly become the biggest online shopping event in the world. Once again, you can expect it to dwarf digital sales in the U.S. for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Day.

Started to celebrate being single in China, Singles’ Day always falls on November 11 because the date 11/11 represents four singles standing together. The holiday became a monster shopping event beginning in 2009 with Alibaba offering steep, round-the-clock discounts. Today the holiday is for all, with competitors like JD.com (JD) and Pinduoduo (PDD) also offering deals on November 11.

Alibaba saw sales for its Singles’ Day festival total more than 498.2 billion yuan, or over $75 billion, up from 268 billion yuan of purchases last year, Bloomberg reported Wednesday just after 11 a.m. ET. The e-commerce giant started the sale earlier this year, with sales lasting 11 days instead of 24 hours.

Last year about half a billion shoppers bought about $38.4 billion worth of goods on Alibaba’s platforms. That’s a 26% increase year over year.

Singles’ Day performance was higher than the five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday in which U.S. shoppers spent a record $28.49 billion online last year, according to Adobe Analytics data. Some $7.2 billion was spent on Black Friday, while Cyber Monday generated $9.4 billion in digital sales.

Meanwhile Amazon’s Prime Day, seen by some this year as the unofficial start to the holiday season, brought in about $10.4 billion in sales, up 45% from last year’s $7.14 billion in sales.

Alibaba added a promotional window from Nov 1 - Nov 3, ahead of this week’s official event, giving a glimpse of how foreign brands are performing.

Bloomberg reports during the first 111 minutes of sales on Nov. 1, Nike (NKE) and Apple (AAPL) were some of the 100 brands generating about $15 million in transactions. Esteé Lauder (EL) was the first to surpass 1 billion yuan in sales on the company’s Tmall platform.

380,2020-11-10T20:35:50+00:00,Stocks mixed as tech sell-off continues,"Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss today's market action as tech stocks see a sell-off.

Video Transcript

ADAM SHAPIRO: But there's still opportunity in this market. And to help us find where the value may be hidden, Steve Sosnick joins us. He's interactive Brokers Chief Strategist. And he is joining us now, as he does often, to help us understand what you've been talking about, which has been in play for at least a week, well over a week, the rotation out of tech, for instance, the big growth stocks to more value. And you don't see that changing, do you?

STEVE SOSNICK: Not in the short term. I think what happens now is-- you know, I originally called this trade the widow maker because, you know, it's such a-- it's such a seductive type of trade. You want the value stocks. You know, they seem cheap relative to the growth stocks. But for years the trade hasn't worked.

And that, you know, the widow makers are the trades that seem to make logical sense, but don't actually ever really pan out. For the first time in quite a while, they've started-- this trade has panned out, and it's been working well. The question remains as to whether-- whether it continues to work is you're into a seasonable-- seasonal pattern where investors get a bit more conservative into year-end.

Do they take gains in the big-cap tech stocks? If they do, that money likely flows into the value stocks. Bearing in mind that Apple's market cap is roughly the same as the Russell 2000, so if you start to have money flow out of those giant tech stocks, it can flow into the more conservative lower PE, higher dividend paying shares that people may want to be looking at because they haven't been for years.

SEANA SMITH: So Steve, does your best case or your best assessment then at this point, do you think that it's going to stick? I know you're saying that there's a lot riding on it and seasonality, maybe it's not the best pick at this point. But from what we know now, we have a little bit more clarity, we got the good news yesterday from what we heard from Pfizer, I mean, is that enough conviction for you to be buying some of those cyclical names now?

Story continues

STEVE SOSNICK: I think so. And the reason is, you know, we're fretting about the long bond, whether that makes it over 1% or not. If you want yield, this is your place to get it. You know, you're looking at-- you're looking at some of these consumer discretionary stocks that are paying 2%, 3%, 4% yield. They have the cash flow with which to cover said dividend, which, you know, dividends are nice, but you really have to have a company that's able to afford to pay for them. A lot of these companies can. I can't give specific recommendations, but what I can say is, you know, there's nothing wrong with putting your money into a safe stock. It may not be the sexy pick. But if you want some income, if you want to sleep better at night, that's probably your place to go. And I think there is some-- some validity to that idea.

ADAM SHAPIRO: When you say fretting over bond yields, I mean, I'm looking at the 10-year, and it's almost at 1%. But no one expects, if it does cross that threshold, for it to stay there that long. You would expect the Federal Reserve to step in, wouldn't you?

STEVE SOSNICK: I'm not so sure they do. I mean that's sort of the talk in the marketplace, oh, the Fed's going to get spooked if it goes over 1%. To what end? Long bond yields are at a record low. So what this is telling you is despite the pickup in-- despite the pickup in the government 10-year, even the least creditworthy companies are having money-- having no trouble getting their positions financed.

So yes, it could have a little bit of a negative effect on the housing market. But also remember, the Federal Reserve is responsible for the banking system. The banking system does better when there's a little bit of a yield curve spread because they're essentially borrowing short and lending long. Think about how they do it with time deposits versus mortgages.

I don't know that the Fed is going to ring this alarm bell. Yes, it's a big psychological level if we get to 1%. I'm a little more skeptical as to the wisdom behind this. You know, this-- this theory is out there, and I'm going to push back on that a bit.

SEANA SMITH: Steve, I want to ask you about [INAUDIBLE] you. Mentioned in your notes. Right now it's trading just around 25, so significantly lower than that pre-election action that we saw when it was up just around 40. You say, though, that the VIX is not signaling an all clear just yet. What are you reading from the VIX recent move then?

STEVE SOSNICK: Well, let's say-- you're right to point out that we've come down a long way. We were about 40 before the election and, you know, people were genuinely fearful. And 40 is a level you really can't sustain. On the other hand, 25 is a level that's historically quite high. And what I tend to look at a lot are the VIX futures curve, because that's basically not only what the current VIX is, which is [INAUDIBLE]-- and I always want to stress this-- that's the market's 30-day look ahead of where they think volatility will be over the next 30 days.

So a 25 VIX implies that there's about 1 and 1/2% daily moves in SPX for the next 30 days. That's the average. The interesting thing is the futures are more or less dead flat around the 25, 26 range. So that is saying that the fixed futures are expecting, more or less, 1 and 1/2% moves up or down for the next-- more or less for the next nine months. That's crazy. That's very, very high.

We are seeing a lot of traders buying puts in the VIX, basically saying the VIX will come down in February, March, and beyond. But as of now, the futures remain stubbornly high, and that's telling me that there's some real uncertainty. And the peak VIX levels are in December and January, around the time of year-end and inauguration.

ADAM SHAPIRO: And just in time for Christmas. Steve Sosnick, good to have you here. Thank you very much.

381,2020-11-09T10:28:40+00:00,Apple Must Ask Why Good Help Is So Hard to Find,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc.’s decision to suspend new business with a key supplier highlights just how hard it is for the world’s biggest tech company to find partners that are both reliable and do the right thing by their workers. The problem may be of its own making.

Pegatron Corp. won’t get any new contracts after the Taipei-based company was found to have committed labor violations related to its student workers’ program at factories in China. According to Apple, some were misclassified and allowed to do night shifts and overtime, in contravention of the Cupertino-based company’s rules, Bloomberg News reported.

Its statement is telling:

We have a rigorous review and approval process for any student worker program, which ensures the intern’s work is related to their major and prohibits overtime or night shifts

The term student worker program should ring immediate alarm bells for anyone who cares about labor rights. Getting college or vocational students to work factory production lines is an accepted practice in China that foreign clients including Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. have signed onto for years. Apple at least asks its manufacturing partners to ensure that the work relates to their studies. Under the pressure to churn out product, though, such programs are vulnerable to abuse.

Pegatron said it fired the manager responsible, whom it said “went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms.” Still, we need to question what conditions incentivized employees to work so hard to not only break Apple’s labor code, but also make such efforts to cover their tracks.

This isn’t the first time Pegatron has appeared in print alongside allegations of labor violations. As far back as 2014, China Labor Watch named the company, alongside Catcher Technology Co., Jabil Inc. and Foxconn Technology Group, for failing to undertake corrective action related to labor and safety standards.

Apple attracts the most criticism in the technology industry over labor and environmental standards. This partly reflects ever stricter rules that the company has imposed on its supply-chain partners, the results of which Apple publicizes in its annual Supplier Responsibility Progress Report.

Critics may argue that this is a marketing exercise designed to make consumers feel more comfortable about buying shiny gadgets produced by cheap labor — which helped to yield $57 billion of profit for Apple last year. Yet incidents like this show that for all its talent and money, the U.S. company doesn’t control its suppliers as much as it might wish.

For example, it continues to find workers who were forced to pay recruitment fees to get a job — a contravention of its standards. Apple repaid $1.3 million to 462 partner employees last year, according to its supplier report. In fact, the iPhone maker has booted 145 companies from its supply chain over the past decade for failing to meet its standards. In 2019 alone, Apple discovered 10 core violations related to working hours.

Even at Foxconn, one of its most important and longest-standing assemblers, allegations have surfaced of questionable practices.

Among them, according to a report last month by The Information, Foxconn overquoted the number of workers it needed to build its iPad Pro, part of an effort to pad the supplier’s profit margins. It also supposedly used Apple-owned equipment for work with other clients, a big no-no in the industry, and gave employees of Alphabet Inc.’s Google a tour of a factory used to make MacBook parts — a contravention of Apple’s security protocols, The Information reported. Foxconn denied all the allegations.

Yet having enunciated its standards so clearly, Apple needs to ask why violations keep happening. The drumbeat of infractions is less a testament to the company’s determination to clean up its supply chain than a reflection of the conditions that continue to prevail.

382,2020-11-09T10:28:40+00:00,Apple Must Ask Why Good Help Is So Hard to Find,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc.’s decision to suspend new business with a key supplier highlights just how hard it is for the world’s biggest tech company to find partners that are both reliable and do the right thing by their workers. The problem may be of its own making.

Pegatron Corp. won’t get any new contracts after the Taipei-based company was found to have committed labor violations related to its student workers’ program at factories in China. According to Apple, some were misclassified and allowed to do night shifts and overtime, in contravention of the Cupertino-based company’s rules, Bloomberg News reported.

Its statement is telling:

We have a rigorous review and approval process for any student worker program, which ensures the intern’s work is related to their major and prohibits overtime or night shifts

The term student worker program should ring immediate alarm bells for anyone who cares about labor rights. Getting college or vocational students to work factory production lines is an accepted practice in China that foreign clients including Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. have signed onto for years. Apple at least asks its manufacturing partners to ensure that the work relates to their studies. Under the pressure to churn out product, though, such programs are vulnerable to abuse.

Pegatron said it fired the manager responsible, whom it said “went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms.” Still, we need to question what conditions incentivized employees to work so hard to not only break Apple’s labor code, but also make such efforts to cover their tracks.

This isn’t the first time Pegatron has appeared in print alongside allegations of labor violations. As far back as 2014, China Labor Watch named the company, alongside Catcher Technology Co., Jabil Inc. and Foxconn Technology Group, for failing to undertake corrective action related to labor and safety standards.

383,2020-11-09T09:15:52+00:00,Apple Freezes New Business for Pegatron on China Labor Abuse,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. suspended new business with iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. after discovering labor violations at a student workers’ program, taking strong action to clean up a Chinese-based production chain long accused of worker abuse.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant said it discovered several weeks ago that the Taiwanese manufacturer misclassified student workers and allowed some to work nights and overtime in violation of Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Employees then “went to extraordinary lengths” to cover up the violations. It’s since placed its partner on probation until corrective action is completed, the U.S. company said in a statement.

Pegatron is one of just a handful of partners Apple relies on globally to assemble marquee products such as the iPhone. Like larger rival Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the Taiwanese company is an integral part of Apple’s global supply chain, which has been the target of criticism by labor activists over the years.

The world’s most valuable company is in the middle of producing four new iPhone models with 5G, and has been working with Pegatron to expand iPhone assembly outside of China. Those efforts are unlikely to be impacted by this suspension, which was first reported by local outlet The Paper, as it only covers new business. But Apple’s move hands an opening to rival Luxshare Precision Industry Co., which is on the verge of becoming the first mainland company to assemble the iPhone. Pegatron’s shares gave up gains and closed Monday down 2.1% in Taipei, while Luxshare finished up almost 1% in Shenzhen.

“Pegatron’s current iPhone business should not be affected. However, it is likely that Pegatron will lose some orders for the Apple’s new handsets next year to Luxshare, which is poised to become a new iPhone assembler in 2021,” GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said.

Apple Must Ask Why Good Help Is So Hard to Find: Tim Culpan

Apple spent years upbraiding manufacturers after a rash of suicides at main partner Foxconn in 2010 provoked outrage over the harsh working environments in which its upscale gadgets were made. Soon after, Apple tightened standards and started audits of the hundreds of companies that produce components for its devices, threatening to pull business from those who defy labor laws. But the sheer scale of the chain makes policing difficult. Foxconn and Catcher Technology Co. were among those called out in the past for flouting local regulations.

Story continues

“We are working on the corrective actions and are confident that we will complete it soon,” a Pegatron spokeswoman said Monday.

Apple said it didn’t find evidence of forced or underage labor in Pegatron’s case, but discovered the supplier falsified paperwork to hide violations. Pegatron has fired the manager who oversaw the student worker program, it added.

“Pegatron misclassified the student workers in their program and falsified paperwork to disguise violations of our Code, including allowing students to work nights and/or overtime and in some cases to perform work unrelated to their major,” it said in its statement. “The individuals at Pegatron responsible for the violations went to extraordinary lengths to evade our oversight mechanisms.”

Pegatron said the violations took place at its Shanghai and Kunshan campuses in eastern China and that students working night shifts, over-time, and in positions unrelated to their majors were “not in compliance with local rules and regulations.” It said it’s taken “quick action” to strengthen its procedures, and will add adherence to the code of conduct to metrics used to evaluate senior management.

“Upon discovery of this non-compliant activity, we immediately took the student workers off production lines and worked with our customer and third-party experts to make appropriate arrangements for them to return to their homes or schools with proper compensation alongside all necessary support and care,” Pegatron said in a statement.

What Happened: The violations were related to a student worker program and Apple said it wouldn’t resume the business with the iPhone maker until corrective actions are taken.

“Pegatron misclassified the student workers in their program and falsified paperwork to disguise violations of our Code, including allowing students to work nights and/or overtime and in some cases to perform work unrelated to their major,” the Cupertino-based technology giant said in a statement, as reported by Bloomberg.

“Our investigations have found no evidence of forced or underage labor.”

Pegatron shares dropped 2.09% lower in Taipei after Bloomberg reported the news.

Why It Matters: This isn’t the first time that Pegatron is facing allegations of labor violations. In December 2014, a BBC report claimed there was poor treatment of workers at a factory where Pegatron made Apple products.

A report by China Labor Watch in 2016 said Pegatron's workers in Shanghai were often forced to work ""excessive and illegal overtime,"" as reported by Quartz at the time.

Price Action: Apple shares closed 0.1% lower at $118.69 on Friday.

387,2020-11-03T01:17:24+00:00,Apple to Launch MacBooks With Own Chips Next Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s 15-year relationship with Intel Corp. will officially begin to unwind next week when new Mac computers are revealed.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant said on Monday that it will hold an online event dubbed “One more thing” on Nov. 10. That “thing” will be Macs with main processors designed by Apple for the first time, replacing Intel chips that have been a mainstay since 2006. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.

Apple and overseas suppliers are ramping up production of three Mac laptops with Apple processors: new 13-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros and a new 13-inch MacBook Air, according to people familiar with the matter. Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is assembling the two smaller laptops, while Quanta Computer Inc. is building the larger MacBook Pro. The smaller models are further ahead in production and at least those two laptops will be shown at next week’s event. Beyond the processor switch, the devices won’t have significant design changes.

Apple has less than 10% of the market for personal computers, so the direct impact on Intel sales may be limited. However, the change highlights a crisis engulfing the world’s largest chipmaker. It has delayed a new manufacturing process, giving rivals a chance to catch up. These problems are at least partly behind Apple’s decision to move to in-house chips, although the company has been steadily shifting to this approach for years.

The partnership between Apple and Intel started in 2005, when Steve Jobs outlined a move away from PowerPC processors. Intel helped Apple catch up to Windows computers, some of which were more powerful at the time. In tandem, though, Apple was working on more energy-efficient chips for mobile devices based on Arm Ltd. designs and continues to use those to power the iPhone and iPad.

On Apple’s recent earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook hinted at the Mac launch by saying, “without giving away too much, I can tell you that this year has a few more exciting things in store.” The company generated a record $9 billion in revenue from the Mac in its fiscal fourth quarter.

Story continues

The first Mac processors from Apple will be based on the A14 chip found in the latest iPhones and iPad Air, and tests inside Apple indicate improved power efficiency over the Intel parts they are replacing. The new machines will also have Apple-designed graphics and machine-learning processors.

Apple said in June that the transition away from Intel chips will take two years. After updating its laptop line, Apple will still have until 2022 to update desktop computers -- the iMac, iMac Pro, Mac Pro and Mac mini -- with its own processors.

The company is already at work on a redesigned iMac, the company’s all-in-one desktop, and a new Mac Pro model, Apple’s highest-end desktop, other people familiar with the company’s plans said.

Apple engineers are currently developing a new Mac Pro that looks like the current design at about half the size. It’s unclear if that Mac will replace the current Mac Pro or if it’s an additional model. Apple’s chip designs could help the company reduce the size of its computers due to increased power efficiency, but the current Mac Pro is large, in part, to fit components like additional storage drives and graphics chips.

Apple’s test Mac for developers to write apps for the new processors is a Mac mini with an iPad Pro processor, but the company will still need to roll out a proper update to that model with a Mac-specific chip. The new Macs require macOS Big Sur, a redesigned Mac operating system that makes the software more like iPhones and iPads.

When announcing the transition in June, Apple said the move would provide a common architecture across all of its devices. That means future iPhones, Macs, iPads and Apple Watches will run a variation of the same chip. That will allow devices to work together better and let iPhone apps run natively on Macs for the first time.

Bloomberg first reported on the transition away from Intel in 2018 and again in April. The new Macs will mark Apple’s third major product release this fall. In September, the company announced new Apple Watches and iPads. The iPhone 12 and HomePod mini lines debuted in October.

394,2020-10-30T23:51:38+00:00,Apple Must Pay VirnetX $503 Million in Security-Patent Trial,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was told to pay VirnetX Holding Corp. $502.8 million, the latest jury verdict in a decade-long saga over patents for secure communications.

The jury in Tyler, Texas, reached its verdict in about 90 minutes. It was asked to decide only how much Apple owes VirnetX in royalties for VPN on Demand, a feature that allows users access to virtual private networks. An appeals court had upheld an infringement finding regarding VPN on Demand.

The companies have been embroiled in litigation for a decade. VirnetX, which said its inventions stemmed from technology it developed for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, argued that both VPN on Demand and Apple’s FaceTime features were using its inventions.

VirnetX had told the jury it was entitled to more than $700 million. Apple had countered that it owed about $113 million, claiming the royalty rate should be no more than 19 cents per unit. The jury settled on 84 cents per unit.

“We thank the jury for their time and appreciate their consideration but are disappointed with the verdict and plan to appeal,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. “This case has been going on for over a decade, with patents that are unrelated to the core operations of our products and have been found to be invalid by the patent office. Cases like this only serve to stifle innovation and harm consumers.”

A representative of VirnetX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict.

Shares of VirnetX soared by as much as 21.8% in after-hours trading and were at $6.64 at 7:46 p.m. in New York. Apple’s stock was at $108.53 after finishing the trading day at $108.86.

Apple previously paid VirnetX $454 million because of a verdict over earlier versions of the features. Apple has launched an aggressive campaign to invalidate VirnetX patents, but its victories at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office hadn’t come in time to avoid its losses in district court.

This trial involved a different case with newer versions of VPN on Demand. The trial was required after an appeals court threw out part of the infringement finding, saying the company had redesigned its FaceTime feature to avoid VirnetX patents so the $503 million damages awarded in this case had to be recalculated.

Story continues

VirnetX, which hasn’t been able to gain traction with its own Gabriel software, relies on patent royalties for its revenue. Prior to Apple, its biggest payment came from a $200 million settlement with Microsoft Corp. in 2010.

While it’s looking for another big payout from Apple, the company is fighting allegations that Chief Executive Officer Kendall Larsen’s family makes up a fifth of the company’s 21 employees and the firm is “plagued by nepotism, waste, and corporate governance failures,” according to a complaint pending in Delaware Chancery Court.

VirnetX has asked to have the Chancery Court case dismissed, saying the “litany of gripes” by the owner of five shares of the company’s stock is all public information that doesn’t involve any self-dealing.

The case is VirnetX Inc. v. Apple Inc. 12-855, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Marshall).

396,2020-10-30T20:18:13+00:00,"Market Recap: Friday, October 30","All three major indices closed in the red on Friday with the DOW seeing its worth month since March, led by a sell off in the technology sector and worries about increasing coronavirus cases. The Final Round panel discusses the latest.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to ""The Final Round"" here on Yahoo Finance. I'm Seana Smith. As we wrap up the trading week and the month, taking a look at a selloff here, with all three of the major averages well in the red, although we are off the lows of the day. The Dow off just around 174 points, the S&P off just over 1%.

The NASDAQ has been hit hardest for the entire trading day. The NASDAQ off just around 2 and 1/2%. We were looking at losses of 3% not too long ago. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're seeing in some of those big tech names. Taking a look at Apple and Facebook and Amazon, all three of those names under tremendous amount of pressure.

[BELL]

And that does it for us today. Taking a look at where things settle down, S&P and NASDAQ all firmly in the red on a weekly basis. We're looking at the worst week for the major averages since March. On a monthly basis, this is the second month in a row that we're seeing declines here for stocks.

And taking a look at the Dow specifically, it's the worst month for the Dow since March that we've seen a lot of the selling action for most of the past couple of weeks. In terms of what's triggering the selling action today, a lot of that has to do with what we're seeing in big tech.

Three out of those four tech giants that we talked about yesterday that reported after the bell are moving lower today. Taking a look at Apple, that stock off just around 6%, Facebook also off around 6%. Amazon is also in the red. Google, it was a standout yesterday. It's the only one of those four names ending to the upside.

We talked about it going into these reports, but the bar was set very high, very little room for disappointment. And that's a big reason why we're seeing so many of those names under pressure today. Taking a look at the sector action, we're seeing that reflected in the sector action today. Technology, communications services, consumer discretionary, the worst performers today. All 11 of the S&P sectors are in the red.

Story continues

And then, of course, more broadly speaking, it's not just because of these earnings that we're seeing so much of the selling recently. Also investors are closely watching that rise in coronavirus case count throughout the country and also over in Europe. We also don't have a stimulus package and the possibility of a contested election. All of those factors here weighing on the markets over the last couple of weeks.

I'm joined by my co-host Myles Udland. We also have Akiko Fujita, Jared Blikre, and Rick Newman here joining the conversation for the next 30 minutes. And Myles, I'll just kick it over to you first because we're wrapping up what has been a pretty volatile month for stocks.

The Dow closing in the red for the month, as well as S&P and the NASDAQ. I mean, when you take a look at the losses today, just really highlights how much is riding on these earnings reports and how high the bar has been set going into these results.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, you know, it's gratifying. Not that we make predictions here at Yahoo Finance, but it's gratifying when I wrote in the Morning Brief, I think about nine days ago, that some data that we had looked at from Bespoke Investment Group, that that data suggested that companies weren't being rewarded for earnings beats. And here we are, nine days later, and we see all of these major companies reporting earnings beats. And with the exception of Alphabet, they all get punished for that.

And so this is certainly a material trend here that-- I mean, I guess there is plenty of earnings to go. These are the major highlights. It's one that investors will probably have to contend with, even as we get through the election. And it certainly will be a big part of the story as we get into the beginning of next year.

But really, what we're all thinking about now is what happens on Tuesday. And my favorite market stat-- and we can take it or leave it, whether it really matters, but is that if the S&P goes down from three months before the election to election day, that means the party in power flips. It's been that way every election since 1984. It's worked in every election, except for three, going back to 1928.

And I'm just looking at Yahoo Finance historical data here. The market closed on August the 3rd at 32.94. This is the S&P. Today, it closed at 32.70. So we'll see what happens over the next couple of sessions. It might mean something. It might mean nothing. But this is what our limited grasp of market history has told us is likely to happen. Essentially, this would suggest that Joe Biden is probably going to win on Tuesday.

SEANA SMITH: We'll see. We'll see if we can count on that. I don't know. 2020 has certainly thrown us a lot of curveballs, so--

MYLES UDLAND: I didn't make the rules. It's just some data mining. It's just what we have.

SEANA SMITH: Well, we like it. We always like a couple of good election facts. So it's a good way to wrap up the week. Jared, I just want to get your take just on what we've seen play out not only this week, but for the month of October. We've seen volatility really re-enter this space here, lots of uncertainty just in terms of what's going to happen on November 3. What do you make of the recent action that we've seen?

JARED BLIKRE: Well, the recent action, let's start with today. We had those big tech earnings, and it's also end of month. We could have seen some repositioning. We'll take a look at the bond market in a second because I think that has something to do with it, too, some really interesting things going on there.

But a lot of it just has to do with the heading into the election, also dealing with all these reclosings. We talked about Belgium reclosing. It looks like Germany might do something along those lines. And so if we take a look at the Dow here, this is the worst performer of the majors for the month, down 4.6%. NASDAQ off 2.3%, S&P 500 off a little bit more, 2.76%.

But I want to take a longer term look here. And, you know, at the beginning of the week, or I think it was one week ago, we were still talking about this potential cup and handle pattern. I guess that was two weeks ago maybe. But that really fell apart. And now what we have is a potential double top.

And so, at 32.50 is really turning out and 3,300 a kind of a big support area. So if this doesn't hold, we could have further downside, especially if there is a contested election next week.

So let's take a look at the bond market. Here's a 10-year T-note yield. We can see really picked up in October. We have this August bottom down here. And in the last two days alone, we've tacked on probably 8, 9 basis points for the month of October 18.

Now, we did get a lot of economic reports, and I'll say that we haven't been seeing the rise in bond yields being reflected in the breakevens or the inflation expectation. This is real yields. And when rates head higher, that drags on these big cap names that we've been looking at that reported earnings yesterday. So that's another source of some consternation here.

Then throw in the dollar and some fluctuations there. It's all interconnected, and it's all complicated, but here are the results. Let's take a look because we looked at this for long enough today. Let's take a look at our sectors here over the week.

And we can see that utilities down 3.6%. That was the best performing sector. And discretionary, that's an Amazon play, along with some others. You look at a ETF like IBUY, really a difficult couple of days here. So discretionary is down 6 and 1/2%.

And then if we go to the month to date, the only thing in the green again is utilities. A bit non-intuitive because they're competing with bonds for yields. You would have thought they'd been down, but maybe some M&A activity and some other things related to the COVID crisis explain that.

Bottom line to the downside, we see tech is the biggest, followed here down 5%, followed by energy and healthcare. Worth noting, too, that crude oil just is having its worst week in about three or four months here. So lots being reflected not only in the election trade and the uncertainty around that, but also the global lockdowns that we're seeing.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-recap-friday-october-30-201813421.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'TWTR.US', 'XLC.US', 'XLF.US', 'XLK.US']","['AMAZON', 'NASDAQ']","{'polarity': 0.963, 'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.064}"
397,2020-10-30T03:30:24+00:00,"In China, Big Tech Isn't the Enemy. It's the Strategy","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Beijing’s goal of building a self-reliant technology industry has been elevated to become a strategic pillar, part of the latest five-year plan setting out top national priorities. This means that China is redoubling efforts to wean itself off foreign companies, with the result likely to be a cohort of domestic giants and a slow freeze-out of overseas competitors.

Just as the U.S. government starts looking to rein in, or even break up, big technology companies in the belief they have too much power, China is going in the opposite direction. We should expect to see more money, more policy favoritism, and more attention from party cadres aimed at ensuring the establishment of big successful chip and software firms.

The Fifth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's 19th Central Committee wrapped up Thursday by tasking the nation to, among other things, develop self-reliance and build its technological power.The result will be a more insular approach to industry and trade as Beijing strengthens a robust domestic market for those up-and-coming heroes to ply their wares.

Foreign companies — notably in semiconductors, software or materials — that still believe China is a viable long-term business are kidding themselves. Only those supplying crucial products and services not available locally will have any shot at sustained market access, and even then only until a domestic alternative comes along.

Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. should take note. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. ought to be wary. Meanwhile, suppliers of the equipment, chemicals and software used to design and build chips should enjoy eating at the trough now, because the good times won’t last, if Beijing can help it.

The likes of ASML Holding NV, Tokyo Electron Ltd., and Synopsys Inc. might see some growth years as Chinese companies lean on them to supply the core ingredients of a semiconductor industry, if the U.S. administration doesn’t get in their way to further stymie China’s advancement. But they’d be foolish to not understand that local rivals, backed by Beijing, are doing everything possible to replicate their products.

Story continues

Over the past decade, the government has done a lot to improve intellectual property enforcement and secure economic rights over technological innovation. Nonetheless, it would be a brave Chinese prosecutor or judge who sides with a big Western company over a local upstart in any case of alleged IP theft.

I believe we’ve yet to see the next era of national champions emerge. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have been the backbone of China’s internet development. Beijing would want to see their equivalents in semiconductors come forth.

Huawei Technologies Co. fits the role, a fact that Washington recognizes by attempting to impede the Shenzhen company’s chip division HiSilicon. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. will also play a part, but after two decades it has still failed to match rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or United Microelectronics Corp. Then there’s a collection of state-backed chipmakers such as those in the orbit of the esteemed Tsinghua University.

Yet the Alibaba of chips may not yet be born.

It could be bubbling away in a small Shenzhen office, helmed by former HiSilicon execs determined not to give up their semiconductor dreams despite Washington’s pressure. Or the topic of Zoom calls among locked-down postgrads finishing up their American degrees and planning to return home. Or in the bank balance of a Taiwanese engineer, enticed by the promise of vast riches, after a decade of toiling away at TSMC.

Whoever the next big Chinese tech giant is, you can be sure that Beijing has the money and determination to make sure it succeeds. At all costs.

399,2020-10-29T10:30:15+00:00,We Have Learned to Live Without Movie Theaters,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the Covid-19 pandemic wears on and drives permanent changes to entertainment culture, Hollywood giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures appear to be turning their backs somewhat on movie theaters. The largest among the cinema chains, AMC Entertainment Inc., is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy at the same time that it celebrates its 100th anniversary. Just a few short months ago, it seemed inconceivable that the business of filmmaking could carry on without the box office and surrender almost entirely to online streaming apps. But now it’s clear that Hollywood and audiences can get along without cinemas.

More than $7 billion of market value has vanished from AMC, Cineworld Group Plc and Cinemark Holdings Inc. this year. Although the financial picture is less bleak at Cinemark, Cineworld has hired advisers to help with its balance sheet, and AMC may run out of funds before the new year. “AMC’s cash burn could worsen beyond $115 million a month, while its cash reserves are only about $418 million,” Amine Bensaid, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a report last week. Leawood, Kansas-based AMC is controlled by Dalian Wanda Group Co. of China, where the industry is healthier; China, in fact, recently overtook North America as the world’s largest movie market. Netflix Inc.’s annual revenue also tops the U.S. box office and has for some time. The symbolism weighs heavy on U.S. cinephiles, and the reality of it has studios rethinking strategy.Last month’s weak theatrical showing from Warner Bros.’s “Tenet” and strong streaming debut of Disney’s “Mulan” suggest that theaters either reopened too soon and consumers weren’t ready, or that they’ve already lost their relevance. Mask requirements have also hurt sales at concessions, which theaters crucially depend on for about a third of total revenue.

Disney has since pushed back a number of its upcoming releases, including delaying Marvel’s “Black Widow” to May 2021, a full year from when it was originally scheduled. The same goes for MGM’s “No Time to Die,” which is now set to arrive in April, although the studio reportedly held talks about selling the film to Apple Inc. or Netflix for their streaming services. Even as key New York and California theaters reopen, all signs point to weak demand until the U.S. gets a handle on the coronavirus.

No one would have predicted a sudden pandemic would cripple the entertainment industry all at once. But clouds were forming over movie theaters long ago and companies like AMC failed to prepare.

Disney’s “Avengers: Endgame” grossed $2.8 billion in 2019, making it the biggest film of all time. Still, 162 million fewer tickets were sold in North America that year compared with 20 years ago, according to The Numbers, a box-office data provider. Theater owners responded by renovating auditoriums, improving snack options, installing reclining seats and — buying one another.

Between 2016 and 2017, AMC acquired its rural U.S. rival Carmike Cinemas, Odeon & UCI in London and Sweden’s Nordic Cinema Group for a total of $3 billion including debt. London-based Cineworld Group Plc bought America’s second-biggest chain, Regal, for $5.9 billion. The virus scuttled its plan to buy Canada’s Cineplex Inc.

In a November 2018 earnings call, Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC, highlighted the company’s spending, pointing to its “robust dividend” and a $160 million special payout made to shareholders that year after it secured a large investment from a private equity firm. He also said that AMC repurchased some $500 million of stock, doubled its Dolby locations in the U.S. and was “renovating theaters like crazy in Europe.” Capital expenditures ballooned, and interest expense on AMC’s mounting debt began to eat up its operating profit — all before Covid entered the vernacular:

While the costly investments may have seemed wise at the time, they look much different through the lens of a Covid face shield. A strategy focused on fewer locations in the most profitable markets would have better prepared the industry for what’s to come in 2021: a massive downsizing.

AMC was among companies irked by the effects of a Financial Accounting Standards Board rule change last year that reclassified operating leases as debt, and its executives weren’t shy about saying so. The modification increased debt levels overnight and complicated the calculations of already squishy financial metrics used to compare businesses. After Covid shut AMC’s doors, though, the debt-like burden of those contractually obligated lease payments went from hypothetical to very real. In August, AMC said it reached agreements with landlords to “defer or abate rent” on about 75% of its 900 leases.

That was more than two months ago, and Covid-19 still hasn’t let up. It doesn’t look like a vaccine will fully thwart its spread in 2021 either. AMC and its rivals have no choice but to retreat from areas where the box office shows low odds of recuperating. Even then, how many theaters that remain can survive a streamer’s world?

400,2020-10-29T10:30:15+00:00,We Have Learned to Live Without Movie Theaters,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the Covid-19 pandemic wears on and drives permanent changes to entertainment culture, Hollywood giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures appear to be turning their backs somewhat on movie theaters. The largest among the cinema chains, AMC Entertainment Inc., is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy at the same time that it celebrates its 100th anniversary. Just a few short months ago, it seemed inconceivable that the business of filmmaking could carry on without the box office and surrender almost entirely to online streaming apps. But now it’s clear that Hollywood and audiences can get along without cinemas.

More than $7 billion of market value has vanished from AMC, Cineworld Group Plc and Cinemark Holdings Inc. this year. Although the financial picture is less bleak at Cinemark, Cineworld has hired advisers to help with its balance sheet, and AMC may run out of funds before the new year. “AMC’s cash burn could worsen beyond $115 million a month, while its cash reserves are only about $418 million,” Amine Bensaid, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a report last week. Leawood, Kansas-based AMC is controlled by Dalian Wanda Group Co. of China, where the industry is healthier; China, in fact, recently overtook North America as the world’s largest movie market. Netflix Inc.’s annual revenue also tops the U.S. box office and has for some time. The symbolism weighs heavy on U.S. cinephiles, and the reality of it has studios rethinking strategy.Last month’s weak theatrical showing from Warner Bros.’s “Tenet” and strong streaming debut of Disney’s “Mulan” suggest that theaters either reopened too soon and consumers weren’t ready, or that they’ve already lost their relevance.

401,2020-10-28T01:03:55+00:00,AMD’s $35 Billion Deal Pushes 2020 Toward a Record for Chip M&amp;A,"(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s $35 billion purchase of semiconductor maker Xilinx Inc. pushes 2020 toward a record year for chip deals, as large tech companies rush to consolidate the increasingly competitive industry.

There have now been $110 billion of deals announced in the semiconductor industry this year, led by Nvidia Corp.’s $40 billion bid for Cambridge, England-based chip designer Arm, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Xilinx deal makes 2020 the biggest year at this point on record for pending and completed deals involving semiconductors, the data show.

The highwater mark for semiconductor deals was reached in 2016, when $122 billion in transactions were struck for the entire year. If acquisitions continue at the current pace, 2020 will easily top that level. The largest deal of 2016 was SoftBank Group Corp.’s $24 billion purchase of Arm.

Competition in the semiconductor industry is heating up as companies that were once customers, such as Apple Inc., design their own chips and established players like Nvidia branch out into new areas.

One adviser estimates that there are about 75 public chip companies now and that number could be cut in half because of consolidation in the next few years.

With the Arm deal, Nvidia gets access to semiconductor designs that are in most smartphones and licenses for chips that run thousands of appliances known as the Internet of Things.

Buying San Francisco-based Xilinx gives AMD access to programmable chips for wireless telecommunication networks ahead of phone carriers’ plans to build out high-speed fifth-generation mobile networks. It also helps the company expand further in the profitable market for data-center computer components, currently dominated by Intel Corp.

Earlier this month, Intel agreed to sell its Nand memory unit to South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. for about $9 billion.

These rivalries have made the industry stand out in an otherwise sluggish deal market. Globally, mergers and acquisitions in all sectors are down roughly 23% to about $1.9 trillion from the same period last year, Bloomberg data show.

402,2020-10-27T07:55:20+00:00,"Apple Plans Smaller AirPods Pro, Revamped Entry-Level Model","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning updates to its AirPods earbuds next year, seeking to capitalize on the success of a product that has become an important source of growth.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on two new models: third-generation entry-level AirPods and the second version of the AirPods Pro earbuds, according to people familiar with the plans.

The models will join other new Apple audio devices like the HomePod mini and upcoming over-ear headphones. The company has also weighed launching another smart speaker that would sit between the HomePod mini and the original version in the line up.

The design of the updated entry-level AirPods will be similar to the current AirPods Pro, gaining a shorter stem and replaceable ear tips. Apple is also looking to improve battery life. That model however will not have higher-end AirPods Pro features like noise-cancellation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

For the new AirPods Pro, Apple is aiming to make the earbuds more compact by eliminating the short stem that currently sticks out from the bottom. A design in testing has a more rounded shape that fills more of a user’s a ear -- similar to the latest designs from Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Google.

Integrating noise-cancellation, wireless antennas and microphones into a smaller AirPods Pro casing has proved challenging during development, which could result in a less ambitious design when the product is finalized, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

Apple has internally discussed launching the new low-end AirPods during the first half of next year. The company is also planning new wireless chips to power both models. Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Goertek Inc. are expected to handle most of the production for the new earbuds.

Goertek, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from Apple, jumped 2.5% to a record in Shenzhen trading Tuesday. Luxshare inched up 0.2%, after having more than doubled this year.

Story continues

After being mocked by some early on, AirPods have become one of Apple’s biggest hits in recent years. The company’s Wearables, Home and Accessories division, which includes AirPods, reported $6.5 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up more than 70% from two years ago. The earbuds may get a new sales boost soon because Apple stopped including headphones with new iPhones.

The success has attracted rivals such as China’s Xiaomi Corp. that offer more affordable options.

Apple currently sells entry-level AirPods for $159 and the AirPods Pro at $249. The original AirPods launched in 2016 and were last updated in March 2019. The AirPods Pro came out in October last year.

Beyond the new AirPods, Apple has also internally weighed a new HomePod that sits in size, price and sound quality between the original $299 HomePod and the $99 HomePod mini. It’s unclear if Apple will ultimately launch that product or just further cut the price of the higher-end version.

Apple is still planning to announce high-end, noise-canceling over-ear headphones. The device has faced several development challenges over the past two years and has been delayed multiple times.

The headphones were due to go into production weeks ago, but that was pushed back due to problems with the headband, a person familiar with the matter said. That part was deemed too tight in some testing.

The company initially wanted to include large touch pads on the sides of the headphones, but reduced the size of those panels. Apple has also scaled back some of the interchangeable functionality of the headphones that were a hallmark of the initial concept. The latest version of the product is likely to lack a replaceable headband, but could still include interchangeable ear pads.

404,2020-10-26T00:18:24+00:00,"Lee Kun-hee, Korean Icon Who Transformed Samsung, Dies at 78","(Bloomberg) -- Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics Co. from a copycat South Korean appliance maker into the world’s biggest producer of smartphones, televisions and memory chips, has died. He was 78.

Lee passed away on Sunday with his family by his side, the company said in a statement, without mentioning the cause of death. His family will hold a private funeral. He had been hospitalized since a heart attack in 2014 and was treated for lung cancer in the late 1990s.

Lee, who told employees to “change everything except your wife and children” during his drive to foster innovation and challenge rivals such as Sony Corp., was South Korea’s richest person. He had an estimated net worth of $20.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Samsung, the biggest of South Korea’s family-run industrial groups, known as chaebol, has been led by his only son since the heart attack.

“Chairman Lee was a true visionary who transformed Samsung into the world-leading innovator and industrial powerhouse from a local business,” the company said. “His legacy will be everlasting.”

His son Jay Y. Lee has been the conglomerate’s de facto leader since his father’s hospitalization in 2014, but it isn’t clear whether he will take over his father’s role as had long been anticipated. The younger Lee is currently grappling with two simultaneous legal disputes with South Korean prosecutors over allegations of bribery and corruption related to succession.

Lee, who has denied any wrongdoing, was in fact supposed to attend a hearing for one of those court cases Monday, but instead is expected to remain at the hospital with his family. Samsung hasn’t said who will step into the elder Lee’s role as chairman.

Samsung, the maker of the Galaxy line of smartphones, has been riding a Covid-era boom in online activity despite the legal clashes. The company also supplies semiconductors for Google’s data centers and Apple Inc.’s iPhone, and is the world’s most advanced maker of displays for TVs, computers and mobile devices.

Story continues

Samsung C&T Corp., the de facto holding company for the group, surged as much as 21%, while Samsung Life Insurance Co. rose as much as 16%. Some units at Samsung Group are expected to raise dividends, according to a note from Korea Investment & Securities. Samsung Electronics shares were little changed.

Lee Kun-hee’s heirs now face an estate tax of roughly $10 billion, and paying it may complicate the family’s control of the Samsung conglomerate -- his beneficiaries would likely have to sell some assets to cover the tax — diluting their stake in Samsung. South Korea’s levy of 50% on estates of more than 3 billion won ($2.6 million) is the second-highest among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, after Japan.

The Samsung empire includes 62 companies. Although the late Lee owned large chunks of some of the businesses — including 4.2% of Samsung Electronics — they’re not big enough to afford control of the conglomerate. The family depends on informal ties to executives who run related companies, and a lot of that soft power may dissipate with Lee’s death.

It was Lee Kun-Hee who built the company into the electronics powerhouse of today, becoming synonymous with the rise of South Korea on a global economic stage.

Named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2005, Lee began overhauling Samsung Electronics after he saw the company’s products gathering dust in a Los Angeles electronics store, according to “The Lee Kun Hee Story,” a 2010 biography by Lee Kyung-sik. The Suwon, South Korea-based company had become known for cheap, low-quality electronics gear and was in the “second phase of cancer,” sending out 6,000 people to fix products made by 30,000 employees, Lee said in 1993, according to the biography.

Why Samsung’s Billionaire Scion Faces Two More Trials: QuickTake

The company’s makeover started in 1993 when Lee gathered top executives in Germany and laid out a plan, known as the Frankfurt Declaration, to transform Samsung from a second-tier television maker into an industry leader. The company’s new mission: create high-quality products, even if it meant lower sales.

Samsung Electronics became the world’s top maker of computer memory chips in 1992, the same year it became the first to develop 64-megabyte DRAM chips, according to the company.

Lee was born on Jan. 9, 1942, in Daegu about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, and was raised in the nearby rural district of Uiryeong, according to the company.

In 1938, his father Lee Byung-chull opened a four-story grocery store in Daegu that would later become Samsung Group.

As a teenager, Lee Kun-Hee liked movies and cars and kept to himself. He took up wrestling and played rugby in high school to fight loneliness. He graduated with a degree in economics from Waseda University in Tokyo and also studied business administration in the U.S. at George Washington University in Washington.

In 1971, Lee Byung-chull chose his youngest son to be his successor, and in 1974, the company moved into semiconductors when it acquired a 50% stake in unprofitable Hankook Semiconductor. The business turned profitable in 1988, helped by dynamic random-access memory chips it produced.

After the Frankfurt Declaration, Lee required employees to arrive at work at 7 a.m. instead of their usual 8:30 a.m. start, so they could “soak up reform in their slumber,” according to the biography.

In 1995, he assembled 2,000 workers to watch him make a bonfire out of 150,000 mobile phones, fax machines and other company products that didn’t meet his quality standards.

Lee’s cultural change eventually produced results. Samsung Electronics surpassed Tokyo-based Sony to become the top seller of flat-screen TVs in 2006, the same year its market value exceeded $100 billion.

In 2010, Samsung introduced the Galaxy-branded smartphone running Alphabet Inc.’s Android software, which helped it pass Apple as the world’s biggest smartphone maker in 2011 in terms of units sold. By introducing the Galaxy Note in 2011, Samsung created a new product niche known as the phablet, a smartphone-tablet hybrid.

Political Controversy

Samsung became the biggest seller of all mobile phones in 2012, unseating Nokia Oyj, which had been the industry leader for more than a decade. Its success in smartphones then boosted profits at its component businesses, including memory chips, display and processors.

Lee’s career was also notable for its setbacks and controversies. An expansion into the car business was unsuccessful. Samsung Motor Inc. rolled out its first automobiles in 1998 and failed to attract buyers. The unit was placed into receivership and Renault SA purchased a majority stake in 2000.

Lee was mired in political scandals in the late 1990s after being convicted of paying bribes to former president Roh Tae-woo in 1996. He was pardoned by President Kim Young-sam a year later.

In 2009, Lee was found guilty of tax evasion and breach of duty for causing losses at Samsung SDS Co., an information technology services provider, because he knew the company illegally sold bonds with warrants to his son at artificially low prices. He was fined 110 billion won and received a suspended three-year jail sentence.

Presidential Pardon

Four months after the 2009 ruling, South Korea’s then-President Lee Myung-bak pardoned Lee, a member of the International Olympic Committee, so he could help the country’s successful bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

Lee, who resigned from the board of Samsung Electronics in 2008 amid the controversies, returned as chairman in March 2010, telling employees the business was “facing a real crisis.”

“In 10 years, the majority of products that represent Samsung may no longer exist,” he said in a statement announcing his return. “We must have a new start. There is no time to hesitate.”

Two months later, Samsung Group said it would invest 23 trillion won to expand in areas such as health care and solar batteries by 2020.

Lee’s son, Jay Y. Lee, became vice chairman of Samsung Electronics in December 2012 and his daughter, Lee Boo-jin, is president of Hotel Shilla Co., a Samsung affiliate, raising concerns that the founding family would maintain its grip on the conglomerate at the expense of minority shareholders. That issue lies at the heart of the two legal disputes the younger Lee is now embroiled in.

In August 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the retrial of Jay Y. Lee over bribery charges that voided an earlier decision to suspend Lee’s 2.5-year prison sentence. A special prosecutor had indicted the Samsung heir on charges of bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye in return for government backing for a merger that helped cement his control over Samsung while his father was hospitalized.

In 1967, Lee Kun-hee married Hong Ra-hee. In addition to children Jay Y. and Boo-jin, he had a daughter, Lee Seo-hyun. Another daughter, Lee Yoon-hyung, died in 2005 at age 26.

405,2020-10-26T00:18:24+00:00,"Lee Kun-hee, Korean Icon Who Transformed Samsung, Dies at 78","(Bloomberg) -- Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics Co. from a copycat South Korean appliance maker into the world’s biggest producer of smartphones, televisions and memory chips, has died. He was 78.

Lee passed away on Sunday with his family by his side, the company said in a statement, without mentioning the cause of death. His family will hold a private funeral. He had been hospitalized since a heart attack in 2014 and was treated for lung cancer in the late 1990s.

Lee, who told employees to “change everything except your wife and children” during his drive to foster innovation and challenge rivals such as Sony Corp., was South Korea’s richest person. He had an estimated net worth of $20.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Samsung, the biggest of South Korea’s family-run industrial groups, known as chaebol, has been led by his only son since the heart attack.

“Chairman Lee was a true visionary who transformed Samsung into the world-leading innovator and industrial powerhouse from a local business,” the company said. “His legacy will be everlasting.”

His son Jay Y. Lee has been the conglomerate’s de facto leader since his father’s hospitalization in 2014, but it isn’t clear whether he will take over his father’s role as had long been anticipated. The younger Lee is currently grappling with two simultaneous legal disputes with South Korean prosecutors over allegations of bribery and corruption related to succession.

Lee, who has denied any wrongdoing, was in fact supposed to attend a hearing for one of those court cases Monday, but instead is expected to remain at the hospital with his family. Samsung hasn’t said who will step into the elder Lee’s role as chairman.

Samsung, the maker of the Galaxy line of smartphones, has been riding a Covid-era boom in online activity despite the legal clashes. The company also supplies semiconductors for Google’s data centers and Apple Inc.’s iPhone, and is the world’s most advanced maker of displays for TVs, computers and mobile devices.

Samsung C&T Corp., the de facto holding company for the group, surged as much as 21%, while Samsung Life Insurance Co. rose as much as 16%. Some units at Samsung Group are expected to raise dividends, according to a note from Korea Investment & Securities. Samsung Electronics shares were little changed.

Lee Kun-hee’s heirs now face an estate tax of roughly $10 billion, and paying it may complicate the family’s control of the Samsung conglomerate -- his beneficiaries would likely have to sell some assets to cover the tax — diluting their stake in Samsung. South Korea’s levy of 50% on estates of more than 3 billion won ($2.6 million) is the second-highest among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, after Japan.

The Samsung empire includes 62 companies. Although the late Lee owned large chunks of some of the businesses — including 4.2% of Samsung Electronics — they’re not big enough to afford control of the conglomerate. The family depends on informal ties to executives who run related companies, and a lot of that soft power may dissipate with Lee’s death.

It was Lee Kun-Hee who built the company into the electronics powerhouse of today, becoming synonymous with the rise of South Korea on a global economic stage.

Named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2005, Lee began overhauling Samsung Electronics after he saw the company’s products gathering dust in a Los Angeles electronics store, according to “The Lee Kun Hee Story,” a 2010 biography by Lee Kyung-sik. The Suwon, South Korea-based company had become known for cheap, low-quality electronics gear and was in the “second phase of cancer,” sending out 6,000 people to fix products made by 30,000 employees, Lee said in 1993, according to the biography.

Why Samsung’s Billionaire Scion Faces Two More Trials: QuickTake

The company’s makeover started in 1993 when Lee gathered top executives in Germany and laid out a plan, known as the Frankfurt Declaration, to transform Samsung from a second-tier television maker into an industry leader. The company’s new mission: create high-quality products, even if it meant lower sales.

Samsung Electronics became the world’s top maker of computer memory chips in 1992, the same year it became the first to develop 64-megabyte DRAM chips, according to the company.

Lee was born on Jan. 9, 1942, in Daegu about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, and was raised in the nearby rural district of Uiryeong, according to the company.

In 1938, his father Lee Byung-chull opened a four-story grocery store in Daegu that would later become Samsung Group.

As a teenager, Lee Kun-Hee liked movies and cars and kept to himself. He took up wrestling and played rugby in high school to fight loneliness. He graduated with a degree in economics from Waseda University in Tokyo and also studied business administration in the U.S. at George Washington University in Washington.

In 1971, Lee Byung-chull chose his youngest son to be his successor, and in 1974, the company moved into semiconductors when it acquired a 50% stake in unprofitable Hankook Semiconductor. The business turned profitable in 1988, helped by dynamic random-access memory chips it produced.

After the Frankfurt Declaration, Lee required employees to arrive at work at 7 a.m. instead of their usual 8:30 a.m. start, so they could “soak up reform in their slumber,” according to the biography.

In 1995, he assembled 2,000 workers to watch him make a bonfire out of 150,000 mobile phones, fax machines and other company products that didn’t meet his quality standards.

Lee’s cultural change eventually produced results. Samsung Electronics surpassed Tokyo-based Sony to become the top seller of flat-screen TVs in 2006, the same year its market value exceeded $100 billion.

In 2010, Samsung introduced the Galaxy-branded smartphone running Alphabet Inc.’s Android software, which helped it pass Apple as the world’s biggest smartphone maker in 2011 in terms of units sold. By introducing the Galaxy Note in 2011, Samsung created a new product niche known as the phablet, a smartphone-tablet hybrid.

Political Controversy

Samsung became the biggest seller of all mobile phones in 2012, unseating Nokia Oyj, which had been the industry leader for more than a decade. Its success in smartphones then boosted profits at its component businesses, including memory chips, display and processors.

Lee’s career was also notable for its setbacks and controversies. An expansion into the car business was unsuccessful. Samsung Motor Inc. rolled out its first automobiles in 1998 and failed to attract buyers. The unit was placed into receivership and Renault SA purchased a majority stake in 2000.

Lee was mired in political scandals in the late 1990s after being convicted of paying bribes to former president Roh Tae-woo in 1996. He was pardoned by President Kim Young-sam a year later.

In 2009, Lee was found guilty of tax evasion and breach of duty for causing losses at Samsung SDS Co., an information technology services provider, because he knew the company illegally sold bonds with warrants to his son at artificially low prices. He was fined 110 billion won and received a suspended three-year jail sentence.

Presidential Pardon

Four months after the 2009 ruling, South Korea’s then-President Lee Myung-bak pardoned Lee, a member of the International Olympic Committee, so he could help the country’s successful bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

Lee, who resigned from the board of Samsung Electronics in 2008 amid the controversies, returned as chairman in March 2010, telling employees the business was “facing a real crisis.”

“In 10 years, the majority of products that represent Samsung may no longer exist,” he said in a statement announcing his return. “We must have a new start. There is no time to hesitate.”

Two months later, Samsung Group said it would invest 23 trillion won to expand in areas such as health care and solar batteries by 2020.

Lee’s son, Jay Y. Lee, became vice chairman of Samsung Electronics in December 2012 and his daughter, Lee Boo-jin, is president of Hotel Shilla Co., a Samsung affiliate, raising concerns that the founding family would maintain its grip on the conglomerate at the expense of minority shareholders. That issue lies at the heart of the two legal disputes the younger Lee is now embroiled in.

In August 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the retrial of Jay Y. Lee over bribery charges that voided an earlier decision to suspend Lee’s 2.5-year prison sentence. A special prosecutor had indicted the Samsung heir on charges of bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye in return for government backing for a merger that helped cement his control over Samsung while his father was hospitalized.

In 1967, Lee Kun-hee married Hong Ra-hee. In addition to children Jay Y. and Boo-jin, he had a daughter, Lee Seo-hyun. Another daughter, Lee Yoon-hyung, died in 2005 at age 26.

Apple’s major assembly partners, Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp., have all set up either a subsidiary or an iPhone assembly plant in India. The chairman of Cheng Uei, also known as Foxlink, is T.C. Gou, the brother of Foxconn founder Terry Gou.

India is trying to attract manufacturing for Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and other major smartphone brands with an incentive program, as political tensions between the U.S. and China escalate. The global coronavirus pandemic has added pressure on companies to review supply chains.

Cheng Uei said in a statement on Friday that a company engineer was caught on internal surveillance video this month damaging automation equipment at the new Indian plant near Chennai. The suspect is a Chinese national, and the incident was reported to local police and Chinese authorities, it said.

408,2020-10-23T19:13:48+00:00,Electoral Implications For Leveraged Tech ETF,"Plenty of sectors are in electoral crosshairs this year, technology chief among them. The S&P 500's largest sector weight is a leadership group again in 2020, but there are implications for it come Election Day.

What Happened

Those implications make the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL) a credible post-election idea. TECL attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, a benchmark that's essentially an ode to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as that duo combine for more than 44% of the index's weight.

As has been widely documented, some titans of tech are drawing the ire of politicians on both sides of the aisle, but the conventional wisdom is that a victory by former Vice President Joe Biden would take some of the heat off the sector.

Why It's Important

That will probably prove to be true if Biden wins, but there are reasons to consider TECL, including intra-tech rotations.

“If you are long-duration technology – SaaS, payment processors, FAANG – you do not believe rotation is sustainable. Evidence of that view is best represented in the 8% bounce in the NASDAQ-100 Index (NDX) since the week of September 25,” writes Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous. “The opposing view is that cyclical technology, value names, and GARP stocks should benefit from a more balanced portfolio into the Presidential Election, especially if Biden wins. He is more likely to break up the monopoly names.”

Assuming Biden pursues the breaking up monopolies angle, TECL's bearish counterpart, the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS), could come into focus. However, that thesis probably doesn't account for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a friend of Silicon Valley, being Biden's running mate.

What's Next

Monopoly breaking is hard and even if President Trump scores the upset, there are no guarantees he'll have the political capital to wage anything more than verbal war against tech giants.

Story continues

That is to say even if he does pull victory from the jaws of defeat, TECL should still shape up nicely after Election Day. Plus, there are more technical reasons that could be the case.

“Regarding the old generals – Oracle, Cisco, Intel, etc. – many of the charts are constructive,” said Azous.

Those names and other mature tech fare reside in TECL's underlying index.

One such name is Nokia stock. Dark clouds over Nokia (NOK) brand name on top of a building in Helsinki, Finland

Recent research by Nokia and Nokia Bell Labs determined that “5G-enabled industries have the potential to add $8 trillion to global GDP by 2030, as COVID-19 accelerates medium and long-term digital investment and value creation… Companies at an advanced level of 5G adoption were the only group to experience a net increase in productivity (+10%) following COVID-19, and the only group able to maintain or increase customer engagement during the pandemic.”

The report continues, “across 8 economies – Australia, Germany, Finland, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the UK and the US – 50% of companies are at the midway level on 5G readiness, between initial planning, trials and deployment, compared to just 7% that are classed as 5G mature.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Now investors may wonder if they should buy the shares of Nokia, one of the companies that is leading the global deployment of 5G networks. The company is expected to report earnings at the end of October. Between now and then, Nokia stock may be choppy, especially given the increased volatility levels of the stock market during this busy earnings season. However, long-term investors may regard dips by Nokia as a good opportunity to buy its shares. Here’s why.

Nokia’s Q2 Results

Finland-based Nokia makes telecom-grade networking equipment. In 2013, it sold its fading mobile-phone business to Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT). Then management changed course, re-positioning the company as a networking firm, and, more recently, as a 5G-equipment business.

The company released its Q2 results in late July. Last quarter, Nokia’s sales dropped 11% year-over-year to 5.09 billion euros. On the other hand, its profit, excluding certain items, came in at 316 million euros, compared to 258 million euros during the same period a year earlier. Investors were pleased with Nokia’s cash flow and profitability.

Story continues

Over the past several quarters, Nokia has been increasing its large-scale capital investments, particularly in 5G networking. Its most important clients are communication service providers. The company has signed several important deals to introduce 5G networks in a number of countries.

For instance, in late September, it signed a major 5G equipment agreement with BT (OTCMKTS:BTGOF), the U.K.’s biggest telecom company. In October, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) announced it had chosen  Nokia to provide private 5G networks outside the U.S., mainly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. NASA has also recently selected Nokia as a partner to build the first LTE/4G communications system on the moon.

Analysts believe that, going forward, the proliferation of 5G technology will likely drive Nokia’s growth. Their median price target on Nokia stock is $5.27. The shares’ forward price-earnings and price-sales ratios stand at 12.94 and 0.89, respectively. More value investors may begin to buy the shares.

The Bottom Line on Nokia Stock

In recent quarters, Nokia’s management has put more emphasis on getting 5G contracts. Its recent 5G wins have shown that those efforts are beginning to pay off.

I believe that Nokia stock price will likely go over $5 in the coming weeks, and it could possibly go even higher than that. Therefore, long-term investors should consider buying it around its current levels. Meanwhile, the company could even become a takeover target.

Alternatively, those investors who are interested in 5G names but do not want to buy the stock may consider purchasing the shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that owns the company. Examples of such funds include the Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSE:FIVG), the First Trust IndXX NextG ETF (NASDAQ:NXTG), and the Defiance Quantum ETF (NYSE:QTUM).

411,2020-10-21T21:00:00+00:00,Apple’s Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural Vietnam,"(Bloomberg) -- Not long ago Vietnam’s Bac Giang province was one of the nation’s poorest regions, known for producing rice, lychees and poultry dubbed “running chicken.” That was before the global tech supply chain shifted its way.

Now officials in the rural area north of Hanoi host representatives from Apple Inc. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The growth in foreign investment is almost doubling every year -- even during the coronavirus pandemic -- and the province forecasts the value of exports this year will reach $11 billion, a tenfold leap in six years. Residents have swapped loud, dirty motorbikes for new Honda two-wheelers while others drive Toyota SUVs and Mercedes sedans on freshly paved roads.

“Life is heaven now and it’s thanks to the factories,” said Nguyen Van Lanh, 64. His family, which once couldn’t afford to buy meat, runs boarding rooms for workers built with their factory salary savings. One relative with a loan business for plant employees drives a red Mercedes-Benz.

The boom in Bac Giang highlights how the shift in the world’s supply chains is touching regions previously left behind. Vietnam’s ability to attract more sophisticated manufacturing is accelerating with rising Chinese labor costs, the U.S.-China trade war and logistics vulnerabilities amid the epidemic, which the nation’s Communist leaders have so far successfully curtailed.

Shifting Sands

During the decades after the Vietnam War as the country opened its borders to foreign investors and trade, Bac Giang remained poor. Its 2010 per capita income was $650, about half that of the nation overall, according to government statistics. The region’s flood-prone plains produced low-yielding crops, so its residents looked for factory jobs some 1,700 kilometers from home in the south. Now the province is experiencing its first boom as per capita income is forecast at $3,000 this year.

Manufacturers are knocking on the doors of Vietnam’s northern provinces and committing billions of dollars to set up operations, including Samsung Electronics Co., where it is producing about half its smartphones. Apple assembly partner Pegatron Corp. plans to invest $1 billion in the northern port city of Haiphong, local media reported, following moves to Vietnam of other suppliers for the Cupertino, California company. Apple recently posted Vietnam job openings, including for a mechanical quality engineer, and managers for supply chain operations and government relations.

Story continues

Vietnam’s success, though, is creating a swelling trade surplus with the U.S., its largest export market, reaching $34.8 billion by July. Driven in part by device shipments, the imbalance triggered tariff threats. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced an investigation into Vietnam’s currency policy earlier this month.

For now, investments from electronics suppliers continue pouring in as other sectors struggle amid the pandemic. The country’s tourism revenue has been slashed by about 50% and garment and other factories are laying off tens of thousands of workers as exports in the trade-dependent economy stall. Economic growth is forecast to slow to 2%-3% in 2020 from last year’s 7.02%, though the government expects a recovery to 6%-7% between 2021 and 2025.

Vietnam’s low costs, political stability, investor-friendly policies, improving infrastructure and state-backed efforts to promote tech startups make the country appealing, said Gene Tyndall, a supply chain expert at Atlanta-based eMATE Consulting.

Cows, Factories

In the heart of Bac Giang, where cows still roam the streets, a six-lane thoroughfare now replaces a one-lane road. Almost two dozen industrial parks for factories are proposed as pile drivers and cranes dot the landscape. The local economy expanded by 10.9% in the first nine months of 2020 from a year earlier compared with 2.12% growth for the entire country during the same period.

“We are living the changing of the global supply chain,” said Nguyen Dai Luong, deputy chairman of the People’s Committee in Viet Yen district, where four of the province’s five operating industrial parks are located. The pace of manufacturers moving to Bac Giang has surged since 2016 as companies poured $3.8 billion into the province, a fourfold increase from the previous four years.

The government is building a river port for transporting parts and, at Apple’s request, provided land for workers’ housing near the 16-hectare complex of Luxshare Precision Industry Co., the world’s biggest manufacturer of AirPods, Luong said.

Bac Giang has nearly full employment, with residents of nearby provinces rushing in to chase the electronics gold rush at companies such as Luxshare. The Chinese company will hire 20,000 workers in the last four months of the year, bringing the total to 47,000 in his district, Luong said. The company employs 12,000 elsewhere in the province, he said.

Higher Salaries

Electronics assembly line workers can earn an after-tax salary of about $5,500 a year, including overtime and bonuses, more than the nation’s average annual salary of less than $3,000, Luong said.

Nguyen Thi Ha, 22, mixed concrete for a construction company before joining an assembly line making 10 million dong ($431) a month. “I used to earn about half of that working under the sun and sometimes in the rain,” said Ha, who declined to identify her Taiwanese employer.

Factory workers pack restaurants like Lao Chu Quan, downing pitchers of beer, plates of pork cooked on an outdoor rotisserie and fresh fish hot pot. “They spend freely,” said Nguyen Thi Ly, the 26-year-old manager whose family owns a Mazda automobile and five new motorbikes after having “almost nothing” before the factories came. “Our lives have changed, amazingly.”

The sudden growth comes with a cost: Electronics assembly lines are high-pressured. Hoang Phuong Duy, 30, participated in a brief September labor strike at Luxshare that was triggered by a change in overtime pay calculation, leading to tense standoffs between workers and supervisors who don’t speak Vietnamese.

Duy said the company quickly resolved the dispute to the workers’ satisfaction. “It’s very hard working on assembly lines,” he added. “We always have to be very fast with an intense concentration while working long hours.”

Vietnam’s challenge going forward is to ensure that education improves so the country can avoid the “middle-income trap” once factories leave as costs eventually rise and pivot to a high-skilled economy, said Scott Rozelle, a Stanford University development economist.

A high-quality education for future generations is the dream of Bac Giang residents such as boarding house owner Lanh, who as a child harvested rice from a “basket boat” on flooded fields where factories now rise up.

“We hardly had anything to eat and clothes to wear,” he said of his childhood. Gazing down at his 3-month-old granddaughter, he added: “She will have plenty of food to eat and the best clothes to wear. We will send her to a university so she can have more opportunities than we ever had.”

The search giant takes two other steps back in time: it brought back the fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 5’s rear and moved to an aluminum enclosure amid a sea of all-glass smartphones. In testing, however, the Pixel 5 proved each of those to be an upgrade in daily use.

413,2020-10-21T21:00:00+00:00,Apple’s Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural Vietnam,"(Bloomberg) -- Not long ago Vietnam’s Bac Giang province was one of the nation’s poorest regions, known for producing rice, lychees and poultry dubbed “running chicken.” That was before the global tech supply chain shifted its way.

Now officials in the rural area north of Hanoi host representatives from Apple Inc. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The growth in foreign investment is almost doubling every year -- even during the coronavirus pandemic -- and the province forecasts the value of exports this year will reach $11 billion, a tenfold leap in six years. Residents have swapped loud, dirty motorbikes for new Honda two-wheelers while others drive Toyota SUVs and Mercedes sedans on freshly paved roads.

“Life is heaven now and it’s thanks to the factories,” said Nguyen Van Lanh, 64. His family, which once couldn’t afford to buy meat, runs boarding rooms for workers built with their factory salary savings. One relative with a loan business for plant employees drives a red Mercedes-Benz.

The boom in Bac Giang highlights how the shift in the world’s supply chains is touching regions previously left behind. Vietnam’s ability to attract more sophisticated manufacturing is accelerating with rising Chinese labor costs, the U.S.-China trade war and logistics vulnerabilities amid the epidemic, which the nation’s Communist leaders have so far successfully curtailed.

Shifting Sands

During the decades after the Vietnam War as the country opened its borders to foreign investors and trade, Bac Giang remained poor. Its 2010 per capita income was $650, about half that of the nation overall, according to government statistics. The region’s flood-prone plains produced low-yielding crops, so its residents looked for factory jobs some 1,700 kilometers from home in the south. Now the province is experiencing its first boom as per capita income is forecast at $3,000 this year.

Manufacturers are knocking on the doors of Vietnam’s northern provinces and committing billions of dollars to set up operations, including Samsung Electronics Co., where it is producing about half its smartphones. Apple assembly partner Pegatron Corp. plans to invest $1 billion in the northern port city of Haiphong, local media reported, following moves to Vietnam of other suppliers for the Cupertino, California company. Apple recently posted Vietnam job openings, including for a mechanical quality engineer, and managers for supply chain operations and government relations.

Story continues

Vietnam’s success, though, is creating a swelling trade surplus with the U.S., its largest export market, reaching $34.8 billion by July. Driven in part by device shipments, the imbalance triggered tariff threats. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced an investigation into Vietnam’s currency policy earlier this month.

For now, investments from electronics suppliers continue pouring in as other sectors struggle amid the pandemic. The country’s tourism revenue has been slashed by about 50% and garment and other factories are laying off tens of thousands of workers as exports in the trade-dependent economy stall. Economic growth is forecast to slow to 2%-3% in 2020 from last year’s 7.02%, though the government expects a recovery to 6%-7% between 2021 and 2025.

Vietnam’s low costs, political stability, investor-friendly policies, improving infrastructure and state-backed efforts to promote tech startups make the country appealing, said Gene Tyndall, a supply chain expert at Atlanta-based eMATE Consulting.

Cows, Factories

In the heart of Bac Giang, where cows still roam the streets, a six-lane thoroughfare now replaces a one-lane road. Almost two dozen industrial parks for factories are proposed as pile drivers and cranes dot the landscape. The local economy expanded by 10.9% in the first nine months of 2020 from a year earlier compared with 2.12% growth for the entire country during the same period.

“We are living the changing of the global supply chain,” said Nguyen Dai Luong, deputy chairman of the People’s Committee in Viet Yen district, where four of the province’s five operating industrial parks are located. The pace of manufacturers moving to Bac Giang has surged since 2016 as companies poured $3.8 billion into the province, a fourfold increase from the previous four years.

The government is building a river port for transporting parts and, at Apple’s request, provided land for workers’ housing near the 16-hectare complex of Luxshare Precision Industry Co., the world’s biggest manufacturer of AirPods, Luong said.

Bac Giang has nearly full employment, with residents of nearby provinces rushing in to chase the electronics gold rush at companies such as Luxshare. The Chinese company will hire 20,000 workers in the last four months of the year, bringing the total to 47,000 in his district, Luong said. The company employs 12,000 elsewhere in the province, he said.

Higher Salaries

Electronics assembly line workers can earn an after-tax salary of about $5,500 a year, including overtime and bonuses, more than the nation’s average annual salary of less than $3,000, Luong said.

Nguyen Thi Ha, 22, mixed concrete for a construction company before joining an assembly line making 10 million dong ($431) a month. “I used to earn about half of that working under the sun and sometimes in the rain,” said Ha, who declined to identify her Taiwanese employer.

Factory workers pack restaurants like Lao Chu Quan, downing pitchers of beer, plates of pork cooked on an outdoor rotisserie and fresh fish hot pot. “They spend freely,” said Nguyen Thi Ly, the 26-year-old manager whose family owns a Mazda automobile and five new motorbikes after having “almost nothing” before the factories came. “Our lives have changed, amazingly.”

The sudden growth comes with a cost: Electronics assembly lines are high-pressured. Hoang Phuong Duy, 30, participated in a brief September labor strike at Luxshare that was triggered by a change in overtime pay calculation, leading to tense standoffs between workers and supervisors who don’t speak Vietnamese.

Duy said the company quickly resolved the dispute to the workers’ satisfaction. “It’s very hard working on assembly lines,” he added. “We always have to be very fast with an intense concentration while working long hours.”

Vietnam’s challenge going forward is to ensure that education improves so the country can avoid the “middle-income trap” once factories leave as costs eventually rise and pivot to a high-skilled economy, said Scott Rozelle, a Stanford University development economist.

A high-quality education for future generations is the dream of Bac Giang residents such as boarding house owner Lanh, who as a child harvested rice from a “basket boat” on flooded fields where factories now rise up.

“We hardly had anything to eat and clothes to wear,” he said of his childhood. Gazing down at his 3-month-old granddaughter, he added: “She will have plenty of food to eat and the best clothes to wear. We will send her to a university so she can have more opportunities than we ever had.”

415,2020-10-20T00:36:10+00:00,SoftBank Amasses Over $20 Billion in Public Stock Unit,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. charged ahead with its new public stock trading arm, increasing equity positions to more than $20 billion despite an initially skeptical response from shareholders, according to a person familiar with the investments.

Bloomberg reported in August that SoftBank had been targeting more than $10 billion and that the sum could reach into the tens of billions. The Japanese conglomerate considered tempering its trading plans in early September after reports that SoftBank’s spending spree was stirring froth in tech stocks. The news erased about $9 billion in market value for SoftBank at the time.

Over the past few weeks, SoftBank renewed its commitment to the public equities trading arm, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The strategy is currently built around expectations of a volatile third-quarter earnings season, the people said. SoftBank has been buying out-of-the-money call options, which deliver returns when share prices rise, and selling calls at even higher prices, one of the people said. Call spreads, as they’re known, cap gains but reduce the initial cost.

A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment. Shares fell about 1.5% in Tokyo trading after hitting a new 20-year high on Monday.

Earnings season is proving to be especially unpredictable. On Oct. 12, the Nasdaq 100 index underwent the biggest rally since April, and options-derived measures of volatility also rose.

An unidentified trader recently purchased around $200 million worth of call contracts on tech stocks in a single day. Call open interest in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. has averaged 12.9 million contracts over the 30 days through Monday, the highest since early 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank founder who’s leading the effort to create the equities arm inside his company, has been reluctant to provide many details about his trading strategy. The company has talked more about a broader strategy of selling assets, paring debt and buying back shares that has been well-received by investors. The stock rose to a 20-year high Monday, the highest level since March 2000 in the midst of the dot-com boom.

Story continues

In August, SoftBank disclosed holdings of $3.9 billion in stocks such as Amazon, which reports financial results on Oct. 29, and Netflix, which reports Tuesday. It has bought a lot more stock since then. While focusing on major tech stocks, SoftBank has also been expanding to smaller companies. Last week, it invested $215 million in Norway-based Kahoot, which makes education software.

BRIAN SOZZI: Bringing the GRAMMY Museum straight to your home, the LA-based museum remains closed due to COVID-19, but it still hopes to attract music fans from across the globe with a new online streaming service called Collection:live.

Michael Sticka joins us now. He's the president of the GRAMMY Museum. Michael, good to see you this morning. So walk us through this. What does it look like, and how much will it cost?

MICHAEL STICKA: Good morning, Brian. Thanks for having me. So Collection:live is a monthly subscription, $2.99 a month. We're adding content multiple times a month, actually. So we started with some of our archives of which there is 3,000 hours of archives over the last decade, plus new programs that we're filming currently.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: You know, I was actually fortunate to visit your museum last summer with my family. We had a great time, really some interesting great finds and awesome photos on archives there.

But what are you hearing from artists right now, who cannot have live concerts, cannot really interact with their audience the way they normally would? We're going to have Ricky Martin, actually, on in a little bit, on our next show and ""On the Move."" What are you hearing from artists right now?

MICHAEL STICKA: It's tough out there, you know, especially artists who aren't superstars, who don't have millions of dollars sitting in the bank account. They rely on their tours. They rely on live events. And it's not just the artists. It's the people that work for them. It's the people at venues. It's the people just behind the scenes that you often don't think of, even the caterers, that are really suffering from this.

Story continues

BRIAN SOZZI: What about the future of concerts? Will they come back, and how will they look differently?

MICHAEL STICKA: I think they're definitely going to come back. And I think once they're able to, they're going to come back in a V-shaped recovery, just because people want to gather. People love music. They love live events. They love to be together and celebrate.

So I do think that they're going to be back. Obviously, it's going to be different, especially in the beginning. I'm sure there's going to be still social distancing requirements, mask requirements, safety protocols across the board. But it'll be back.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: And I saw on the website, the Grammys are slated for January 31 of the new year. Do you have any idea what that's going to look like yet? Or do you imagine it will be a virtual event?

MICHAEL STICKA: I'm not sure what it's going to look like yet. You know, the Recording Academy produces the Grammy telecast every year. I know that, obviously, everybody's watching what the VMAs are doing, Billboard Music Awards are doing, the CMAs, everybody out there. So I think it's going-- it'll probably look different. It's just a matter of what that is. I think it's still to be determined, actually.

BRIAN SOZZI: Any problems raising funding for the museum?

MICHAEL STICKA: Oh, yeah. So I mean, that's-- just, you know, we have a big brand, and we have this big music brand, but we're still a museum. We're still a non-profit, a C3 organization. The Collection:live subscription is really only going to replace less than 10% of our lost revenue in terms of ticket sales for our programs that we typically have.

Fundraising, of course, has gone to frontline organizations, which it should, if you think about hunger and homelessness and medical needs out there right now, especially with so many people out of work. So museums, arts organizations have continued to suffer. And I don't see any real true rebound right off the bat with that.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: What's demand been like for the subscription service? Because you're competing with lots of other big names here for people's attention, including Spotify and Apple. I mean, albeit they'll get something different from those services. But what's demand been like?

MICHAEL STICKA: Demand has been good. You know, we don't have a huge marketing budget, so we're not an HBO Max that we can launch and spend millions of dollars telling people about it. We rely on earned media, so me doing interviews, just like this.

Demand has been good, though, from our members, from music lovers, from people that we typically engage with. And what we'll see is that will grow over time, especially when we're able to actually start doing live streams from the theater again.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/grammy-museum-president-online-streaming-160632828.html?.tsrc=rss,"['040300.KQ', 'AAPL.US', 'SNE.US', 'SNEJF.US', 'SPOT.US', 'T-PA.US', 'T-PC.US', 'T.US']",['ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS'],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.152}"

It's hard to keep complicated things simple, and he taught me that. We always did that with the bank, as complicated as it could be. I'm trying to do that with Make-A-Wish, which is to keep a set of money [INAUDIBLE] down to its core elements.

The other thing about Warren Buffett is loyalty. He was loyal, not to a fault because we earned it, but he was loyal, and he knew why he liked the bank. He did his homework. He interviewed me for things, not like financial prowess, but character, and ethics, and long-term commitments.

And a guy like Warren Buffett embodies everything that Make-A-Wish does, giving back and doing it for a lifetime with intent. And so I learned a lot of things from him, but both in the for profit world, I can translate all those to the nonprofit world because loyalty matters and so does long-term views of things because you do smarter decisions when you think about the long view.

ANDY SERWER: Has any kid wanted to be Warren Buffett yet?

RICHARD DAVIS: Yes, and they have before, and not for a million dollars or whatever that typical auction has been created over the years. Warren Buffett is a very supportive member of our Make-A-Wish, as are a number of our celebrities. You didn't ask this, but I want us to shout this out as well. You mentioned one celebrity, we have others, John Cena is over six-- almost 700 wishes now, independent-- 700 independent moments.

419,2020-10-16T11:15:07+00:00,Lockdowns Fueled a Splurge on Rolex Watches and Dior Handbags,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Think lockdowns are bad for luxury? Think again.

Sales at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE’s fashion and leather goods division rose 12%, excluding currency movements, in its third quarter — not far off the levels it was achieving before the pandemic struck. The Bloomberg consensus of analysts’ expectations for the period was for a 0.9% decline.

Instead, the bumper performance shows how demand for expensive handbags, cars and watches bounced back once affluent consumers could emerge from their homes and spend some of the money they saved during lockdown. It’s worth remembering as Europe once again tightens restrictions on movement.

In China, whose consumers could account for 45% of global luxury sales this year according to Jefferies, shoppers treated themselves as stores reopened. And this so-called “revenge spending” phenomenon has expanded to the U.S. and even Europe, as wealthy individuals divert money they would have splurged on overseas vacations and restaurant dining to high-end boutiques.

Until recently, stock markets have rebounded strongly, which typically encourages U.S. consumers to spend. As a result, women may spring for a Christian Dior Bobby bag. Men might shell out on a designer timepiece. Watches of Switzerland Group Plc, the U.K.-based watch and jewelry retailer, recently reported better-than-expected sales.

But these results are not just confined to luxury items you can wear.

Late on Thursday, Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler AG reported a stunning 5.1 billion euros of industrial free cash flow for the July to September quarter. Its mainly white-collar clientele appear to have been less affected by the pandemic than the hard-hit services sector. Cars have also become pretty handy if you’re worried about using public transport or you’re considering a move from the city to the country.

Mercedes-Benz’s big presence in in China — where sales rose 23% year-on-year during the third quarter — has been a big advantage too.

Looking ahead, another beneficiary of this bling boom may be Apple Inc., whose top-of-the-range iPhone 12 Pro becomes available for pre-order Friday. Having saved some money during lockdown, consumers might be more willing to splurge on the more expensive new handsets: The iPhone 12 Pro Max costs $1,199, while the iPhone 12 Mini, with fewer bells and whistles, is priced at $649.

But there are grounds for caution, as the luxury recovery may not be evenly spread across the industry. If consumers are going to make a special purchase, it’s likely to be from one of the best-known names. LVMH has two: Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior. When it comes to watches, the hottest brands right now are Rolex (there are already waiting lists for its new brightly colored Oyster Perpetual models), Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet — all privately owned.

Watches, handbags and jewelry are also items that work in casual settings. Other high-fashion products, such a formal dresses and stilettos, may be more affected by the lack of events to dress up for. An exception is Moncler SpA’s puffer jackets, which could be in demand as winter approaches, particularly if socializing has to move outdoors.

Meanwhile, as concern over the pandemic’s economic toll mounts, the thrill of spending may wane. Add in the damage from a second virus wave in Europe and uncertainty around the U.S. election, and even wealthy consumers may choose to stash, rather than splash, their cash.

For now, however, bling is back. Luxury goods groups should make the most of it while they can.

423,2020-10-12T21:00:00+00:00,China’s Quiet Experiment Let Millions View Long-Banned Websites,"(Bloomberg) -- In a quiet experiment of just two weeks, China provided millions of people access to long-forbidden foreign websites like YouTube and Instagram. The trial appears to signal the Communist government is moving toward giving the country’s citizens greater access to the global internet -- while still attempting to control who sees what.

The Tuber browser-app, backed by government-linked 360 Security Technology Inc., appeared without fanfare late September and offered for the first time in years a way to view long-banned websites from Facebook Inc. to Google and the New York Times, albeit sanitized versions. Chinese users rejoiced in a newfound ability to directly peruse long-blocked content from a mobile browser without an illegal virtual private network or VPN.

The browser, carried on app stores run by Huawei Technologies Co. among others, suggests Beijing is testing ways to let its 904 million internet users into once-prohibited zones. While Tuber bore the hallmarks of state-style censorship and got pulled without explanation Saturday, it’s Beijing’s most significant experiment in years with greater internet freedoms.

State-sanctioned apps like Tuber offer a possible compromise -- a controlled environment in which activity can be tracked and content screened, while allowing academics, corporations and citizens to exchange information. It addresses a complaint among corporations local and foreign that need to access everything from financial data to critical software tools from abroad.

“This latest development with Tuber is interesting because it could be seen as more openness,” said Fergus Ryan, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “But the way that it would actually work would mean that people who use it would be highly surveilled and the information that they are able to access via this platform is filtered by the censorship apparatus.”

Call it Censorship 2.0. Beijing is increasingly confident of support at home after successfully quashing Covid-19. That -- and the urgent need to increase the quality of its scientific and technological research -- could explain why it’s growing more comfortable with the idea of giving broader access to the internet for at least some of its citizens.

Yet it also realizes it faces growing hostility overseas. Beijing, seeking to better police its citizens, still requires companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. to censor and scrub content critical of the government or its policies. It tried for years with mixed success to abolish the hundreds of VPNs commonly employed to bypass the Great Firewall. Endorsing a state-sanctioned window to the internet could curtail their usefulness.

That could have implications for the likes of Facebook and Microsoft Corp. to Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc., who now either comply with censorship to reach China’s users or remain on the sidelines. Google explored -- but shelved under internal pressure -- a project to create a filtered version of its app for the country. Facebook flirted with the idea of a Chinese service but ultimately torpedoed that too.

Tuber -- downloaded five million times from Huawei’s app store since at least late September -- attracted such an initial frenzy in part because of the pedigree of its largest backer. Its developer is controlled by billionaire and tech mogul Zhou Hongyi, who delisted his security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. from New York in 2016 and aligned himself with national interests.

It’s unlikely that Qihoo developed and distributed the app without Beijing’s blessing. It has reportedly worked on projects for the Chinese military and advises Beijing on sensitive cybersecurity issues. The U.S. Department of Commerce in May sanctioned two of Zhou’s companies among 24 entities it said posed national security concerns.

It’s unclear whether any government agency ordered Tuber’s removal. A public relations employee at 360 Security declined to comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet, hasn’t responded to calls and emails from Bloomberg News since Saturday.

Tuber appeared to censor some content, including on YouTube. A search of President Xi Jinping’s name in Chinese yielded only seven video clips uploaded by three accounts claiming to be television stations in Shanghai, Tianjin and Macau. Searching for Xi’s name in English yielded no results at all.

It required mobile number registration, giving developers the ability to track activity because all smartphone numbers in the country are linked to unique Chinese identification. And, like many commercial apps, it asked for permission to access users’ contacts.

“China has to be really cautious to carefully balance opening a little bit more” with maintaining domestic social order, said Yik Chan Chin, who researches media and communications policy at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou. “It’s very important to release the information flow and let the Chinese people have more interaction with the outside world and also to understand the world better.”

Loosening controls over China’s internet could play a vital role in advancing domestic innovations, said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think-tank Center for China and Globalization. Its leaders will eventually open up cyberspace -- to an extent, he said. Tuber, including its official website, remained blocked as of Monday.

“The fact that news about this particular app spread so quickly in China and generated so much excitement was testament to the pent-up appetite for access to the wider global internet in China,” Ryan said.

427,2020-10-12T00:40:06+00:00,Chinese App Helps Users Bypass Great Firewall - Then Disappears,"(Bloomberg) -- One Chinese app briefly gave the country’s internet users access to long-banned websites like Facebook Inc. and Google, setting off speculation about the future of Beijing’s censorship practices.

The Tuber browser, backed by Chinese cybersecurity giant 360 Security Technology Inc., appeared to provide the nation’s 904 million online users the ability to legally visit overseas websites and browse foreign social media. Chinese users hailed their newfound ability to peruse content from Youtube videos to Instagram photos without an illegal virtual private network, or VPN.

But the browser stopped functioning Saturday and disappeared from the mobile app store run by Huawei Technologies Co. It’s unclear whether a government agency had ordered its removal.

“Presumably the government heard about it and asked the stores to take it down,” said Rich Bishop, chief executive officer of AppInChina, a publisher of international apps in the Chinese market.

Tuber’s removal may have ended what many Chinese users saw as a state-sanctioned window to the wider internet arena. Beijing maintains rigid control over its internet sphere, requiring companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. to censor and scrub content critical of the government or its policies.

Tuber’s browser required mobile number registration, giving developers the ability to track activity because all smartphone numbers in the country are linked to unique Chinese identification. The app also censored certain results from the previously banned sites.

A public relations employee at 360 Security declined to comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet, didn’t respond to calls and emails from Bloomberg News on Saturday, which was a work day in the country.

Mainland Chinese commonly use VPNs to bypass the Great Firewall -- the name given to the blockade of an array of foreign internet services from Gmail to Twitter that’s stood for over a decade. Beijing regularly cracks down on illegal VPN services, eliminating such apps from the stores of both Alphabet Inc.’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS.

Before it was removed, Tuber was downloaded five million times from Huawei’s app store. It had been available for download since at least late September, according to online posts. There are numerous WeChat posts on it, and a reporter from state media outlet Global Times promoted the app in a Twitter post. Tuber was made available only for Android phones, according to its website.

Tuber appeared to censor some content, including on YouTube. A search of President Xi Jinping’s name in Chinese yielded only seven video clips uploaded by three accounts claiming to be television stations in Shanghai, Tianjin and Macau. Searching for Xi’s name in English yielded no results at all.

Tuber users trying to access Google appeared to get directed to its uncensored Hong Kong site, a tactic the U.S. giant employed when it pulled its service from mainland China in 2010. The company had explored -- but shelved under internal pressure -- a project to create a filtered version of the app for users in the world’s largest smartphone arena.

“Because of Google internal politics, they don’t want to make a China-compliant version so there’s a clear opportunity for someone to do that,” said Bishop. “But it’s easier said than done.”

The parent company of Tuber’s developer is controlled by billionaire and tech mogul Zhou Hongyi, who delisted his security company Qihoo 360 from New York in 2016 and aligned himself with China’s national interests. The U.S. Department of Commerce in May sanctioned two of Zhou’s companies among 24 entities it said posed national security concerns.

Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation, said he remained confident Chinese leaders will eventually open up cyberspace -- to an extent.

“The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently launched an initiative which promotes cross-border data flows,” Wang said. “It makes sense for Beijing to lift restrictions of some selected sites as a way to send out a positive signal to the international community.”

428,2020-10-12T00:40:06+00:00,Chinese App Helps Users Bypass Great Firewall - Then Disappears,"(Bloomberg) -- One Chinese app briefly gave the country’s internet users access to long-banned websites like Facebook Inc. and Google, setting off speculation about the future of Beijing’s censorship practices.

The Tuber browser, backed by Chinese cybersecurity giant 360 Security Technology Inc., appeared to provide the nation’s 904 million online users the ability to legally visit overseas websites and browse foreign social media. Chinese users hailed their newfound ability to peruse content from Youtube videos to Instagram photos without an illegal virtual private network, or VPN.

But the browser stopped functioning Saturday and disappeared from the mobile app store run by Huawei Technologies Co. It’s unclear whether a government agency had ordered its removal.

“Presumably the government heard about it and asked the stores to take it down,” said Rich Bishop, chief executive officer of AppInChina, a publisher of international apps in the Chinese market.

Tuber’s removal may have ended what many Chinese users saw as a state-sanctioned window to the wider internet arena. Beijing maintains rigid control over its internet sphere, requiring companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. to censor and scrub content critical of the government or its policies.

Tuber’s browser required mobile number registration, giving developers the ability to track activity because all smartphone numbers in the country are linked to unique Chinese identification. The app also censored certain results from the previously banned sites.

A public relations employee at 360 Security declined to comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet, didn’t respond to calls and emails from Bloomberg News on Saturday, which was a work day in the country.

Mainland Chinese commonly use VPNs to bypass the Great Firewall -- the name given to the blockade of an array of foreign internet services from Gmail to Twitter that’s stood for over a decade. Beijing regularly cracks down on illegal VPN services, eliminating such apps from the stores of both Alphabet Inc.’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS.

Before it was removed, Tuber was downloaded five million times from Huawei’s app store. It had been available for download since at least late September, according to online posts. There are numerous WeChat posts on it, and a reporter from state media outlet Global Times promoted the app in a Twitter post. Tuber was made available only for Android phones, according to its website.

TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTake

Tuber appeared to censor some content, including on YouTube. A search of President Xi Jinping’s name in Chinese yielded only seven video clips uploaded by three accounts claiming to be television stations in Shanghai, Tianjin and Macau. Searching for Xi’s name in English yielded no results at all.

Tuber users trying to access Google appeared to get directed to its uncensored Hong Kong site, a tactic the U.S. giant employed when it pulled its service from mainland China in 2010. The company had explored -- but shelved under internal pressure -- a project to create a filtered version of the app for users in the world’s largest smartphone arena.

“Because of Google internal politics, they don’t want to make a China-compliant version so there’s a clear opportunity for someone to do that,” said Bishop. “But it’s easier said than done.”

The parent company of Tuber’s developer is controlled by billionaire and tech mogul Zhou Hongyi, who delisted his security company Qihoo 360 from New York in 2016 and aligned himself with China’s national interests. The U.S. Department of Commerce in May sanctioned two of Zhou’s companies among 24 entities it said posed national security concerns.

Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation, said he remained confident Chinese leaders will eventually open up cyberspace -- to an extent.

“The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently launched an initiative which promotes cross-border data flows,” Wang said. “It makes sense for Beijing to lift restrictions of some selected sites as a way to send out a positive signal to the international community.”

429,2020-10-09T14:32:00+00:00,10 Best ETFs for 2020: The Battle At the Top Tightens,"This year has been a crazy one for investors seeking the best ETFs to buy.

First, the novel coronavirus took a heavy toll on countless stocks. Then we saw a nice recovery in the companies that stood to benefit most from changes in the “new normal.” Meanwhile, industries like air travel and entertainment experienced (and continue to experience) great pain. All of this managed to throw countless exchange-traded funds into limbo, as their general design to hold numerous stocks centralized around a specific theme made some of them particularly vulnerable.

But the madness didn’t stop there.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

More recently, tech stocks took a beating shortly before the first debate leading into the Presidential election. Then President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19.

Now, with the election quickly approaching, we’re still trapped in a period of uncertainty. Will Biden win? Or will Trump stay in charge? Either victory could boost some stocks and ETFs, and tank others. Oh, and don’t forget, an asteroid might hit Earth before we even get to that Nov. 3 election date.

While that last bit is somewhat of a joke, it reflects the overall essence of 2020 quite nicely. Just when you expect that things couldn’t get any more crazy this year, they seemingly always do.

But, thankfully, InvestorPlace.com’s best ETFs for 2020 contest has plenty of winners that should hold strong no matter what happens. It also has a few losers too.

The 7 Best New Stocks From 2020 to Buy Now

With all of that said, let’s take a look at how each of these funds has performed (in ascending order from best to worst) through the end of September:

Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO) Global X Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:CLOU) SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:XITK) Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) The Communication Services SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLC) AdvisorShares Vice ETF (NASDAQ:ACT) iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWO) Consumer Staples Select Sector Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP) The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ) U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS)

There’s not much time left in the year, but a few of these ETFs still might manage to run higher.

Best ETFs for 2020: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) Best ETFs for 2020: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO)

Investor:Tom Taulli
Expense Ratio: 0.6%, or $60 annually per $10,000 invested
Performance Through Q3: 58%

In the end, there can be only one winner of the best ETFs contest. It looks like Tom Taulli’s pick, the IPO ETF, will be the one.

While that might sound like a dramatic reference to the cult-classic film Highlander (“there can be only one!”), it seems fairly accurate. Its current performance (78% year to date) is already significantly greater than the 58% YTD figure recorded at the end of September. At its current level, it has performed nearly 20% greater than CLOU, the No. 2 ETF in the contest.

As impressive as that may be, and with its victory seemingly secure, does it have any more room to run?

The coronavirus helped power IPO at the start of the year as social distancing initiatives led to the breakout success of Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), one of its top holdings. But with clearer expectations developing for the “new normal” ahead, are continued gains guaranteed?

Taulli thinks IPO has what it takes to continue its placement among the best ETFs in the years ahead. While he acknowledges that the IPO market is getting a bit “frothy,” he thinks the trend will continue for some time. According to Taulli, the ETF is a strong way to play the current popularity of IPOs: “when it comes to investing in IPOs, it’s a good idea to have diversification — this is what the IPO fund provides”

Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) Best ETFs for 2020: Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU)

Investor:Dana Blankenhorn
Expense Ratio: 0.68%
Performance Through Q3: 47%

The overall success of cloud stocks (what the CLOU ETF specializes in) this year is undeniable. Again, the pandemic amplified much of that success, but cloud computing is a future-looking theme that was bound for significant relevance and gains without the virus catalyst factored in.

But even the titans must fall from time-to-time. According to Dana Blankenhorn, while the CLOU ETF has been a winner this year, its performance more recently has been ugly. Even so, the ETF is in the No. 2 spot of the contest, and there’s plenty of reason to think it will endure in the months and years ahead:

The companies in CLOU, and those that might be added, are in good position to build the Machine Internet. Anything whose condition can be sensed, calculated, and adjusted will become a networked computer over the next decade. More internet demand will come from machines than from people using them.

10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy From Some of America's Best ETFs

That’s as good of a long-term catalyst as any. Just don’t expect CLOU to edge out IPO as the winner for best ETFs. But in the big picture, as a longer-term investment, Blankenhorn remains positive on the ETF’s outlook.

SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (XITK) Best ETFs for 2020: SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (XITK)

Investor:Bret Kenwell
Expense Ratio: 0.45%
Performance Through Q3: 43%

As its namesake suggests, the XITK ETF focuses on companies involved in innovative technologies. And, as you’re likely realizing by now, the new virus has helped propel many innovative companies since their technologies were adopted much more quickly than expected.

Its holdings include the aforementioned Zoom Communications and other “coronavirus stocks” like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). Although the virus boost will fade in time, most of its holdings should retain their relevance in the years ahead. This is largely what makes Bret Kenwell think that it will remain one of the best ETFs heading into the new normal. He also notes the fund’s diversity as a positive aspect that sets it apart from other growth-based ETFs:

Diversification can be a negative in some cases. In the case of the XITK ETF though, it helps remove any single-stock risk. That’s a benefit in my mind. That’s because growth stocks are likely to rally or fall together, but any one stock could really ruin the fund’s performance if it had too large of a weighting.

According to Kenwell, if growth stocks continue to rise, then the XITK ETF will also run higher. If he’s right, this might be the dark horse of the race. Watch out, IPO!

Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) Best ETFs for 2020: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)

Investor:Readers’ Choice
Expense Ratio: 0.2%
Performance Through Q3: 27%

Our reader’s choice for the contest, QQQ, is always a solid bet. In fact, it won the best ETFs contest in a prior year. It continues to demonstrate its viability as an investment, currently ranked No. 4 in the contest.

Part of what makes it attractive is that its holdings include the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq. While it’s not explicitly a tech stock ETF, it holds behemoths like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a part of its top holdings.

Usually this is a great thing — and for much of the pandemic it has been a winner. But, more recently, tech stocks took a dive and QQQ has started to stutter. I wouldn’t expect QQQ to surpass the likes of IPO, CLOU or the XITK ETF this year, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not one of the best ETFs out there today.

If you have a positive outlook on the world of tech and an economic recovery in general, then there’s no reason to lose faith despite the recent dip.

The Communication Services ETF (XLC) Best ETFs for 2020: The Communication Services ETF (XLC)

Investor:Todd Shriber
Expense Ratio: 0.13%
Performance Through Q3: 10%

A winning theme this year (as with most years in recent times) has been tech. But many of the companies in the newly formed Communication Services sector are also intertwined with these tech-based themes. As such, Todd Shriber’s pick, XLC, has managed to chart a 10% rise this year. That success comes despite all the challenges induced by the pandemic.

The gains for XLC might not be as monstrous as the top three picks in the contest, but there’s still immense promise for its holdings in the years ahead. Holdings like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) aren’t going to disappear anytime soon. And video game plays Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision-Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) have only gotten better as more people cling to video games for entertainment rather than bars and in-person socialization.

Shriber thinks the holiday season could bolster its videogame holdings and companies like Facebook and Alphabet will overcome political challenges, all of which could help it climb a little higher by the end of 2020.

AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) Best ETFs for 2020: AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT)

Investor:InvestorPlace Staff
Expense Ratio: 0.99%
Performance Through Q3: 4%

The InvestorPlace Staff never assumed that the ACT ETF would win the contest, but they did see reason for optimism beyond a victory.

As one of the few ETFs that focus on sin stocks, ACT holds marijuana, booze and tobacco companies. While tobacco and marijuana stocks haven’t been hot players this year, some booze stocks have managed to climb higher. In particular, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) has marked impressive gains this year on the popularity of its new seltzer booze brand “Truly Hard Seltzer.” This has helped keep ACT afloat while much of its marijuana holdings continue to suffer.

7 Sin Stocks to Buy Today For Tempting Dividends

ACT won’t win this year’s contest. But the success of booze amid the coronavirus pandemic and the outcome of the election might ultimately power it a little higher this year and further in the future. It’s certainly worth keeping an eye on if you’re interested in sin stocks.

iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) Best ETFs for 2020: iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)

Source: Shutterstock

Investor:Ian Bezek
Expense Ratio: 0.24%
Performance Through Q3: 2%

Although Ian Bezek’s pick for this year’s best ETFs contest had a rough start in 2020, he still has faith in its comeback. Citing what he calls the “small-cap advantage,” Bezek argues that small-cap stocks generally out-perform large-cap stocks, and while the fund’s smaller holdings have suffered, when the economy recovers, they will soar again.

As Bezek notes, just looking at its YTD performance alone is a little deceiving. Given the selloff in March, the ETF has already climbed more than 70% higher back from its lows. And he thinks that once economic conditions start to normalize, we might expect IWO to rise even higher.

It’s all a matter of perspective:

In owning the IWO ETF, you get exposure to some of the most innovative companies in the country. And at only 5% more expensive than last year, IWO is still a reasonably priced way to get that exposure. It certainly beats chasing many of the software or e-commerce stocks that have already doubled or tripled this year.

If you think that argument by Bezek holds muster, then you might consider IWO a great play from a longer-term view.

Investor:Kent Thune
Expense Ratio: 0.13%
Performance Through Q3: 2%

Playing it safe usually isn’t very exciting, but sometimes it can also prove beneficial in an economic downturn.

As mentioned earlier, 2020 has been a crazy year so far. And the upcoming U.S. presidential election aims to make it even crazier. That’s part of the appeal of a fund like XLP — it offers stability.

After all, even in desperate times, consumers will always purchase “essential” items. That has always been the appeal to consumer staples stocks, the investment theme XLP focuses on. And it’s largely why Thune picked it for the contest.

But, while Thune thinks it’s still a wise choice, he also points out another lesson he’s learned in the process. Old investment theses don’t necessarily apply to the new normal. Instead, he sees “tech as the new defensive play:”

While it may be foolish to say those four most dangerous words, ‘this time it’s different,’ it’s also foolish to assume that the same defensive strategies will work ad infinitum … 2020 was certainly not a normal year, but it does provide a glimpse into what the future holds for capital markets. And investors are wise to take note.

The 10 Top Stocks to Buy For Q4

In summary, the head honchos in tech also demonstrate significant resilience. Maybe it’s time to stop looking at XLP as the only go-to defensive ETF on the market?

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) Best ETFs for 2020: The Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)

Investor:Tim Biggam
Expense Ratio: 0.75%
Performance Through Q3: -43%

As seen with the ACT ETF earlier, this hasn’t been a strong year for marijuana stocks. But while ACT managed to stay in the green this year, bolstered by its holdings in the booze industry, the MJ ETF ended up tanking.

Given that it’s only focused on cannabis-based stocks, this should be no surprise. According to Biggam, the market for CBD and other products is oversaturated and investors lost faith in some of the hype machines that stormed higher in 2019. But as glum as that may be, he also thinks this is a great opportunity.

Biggam sees the MJ ETF making a comeback towards the end of this year and into 2021. He thinks the release of new cannabis-based beverages and further developments in legalization efforts in the U.S. will prove strong catalysts moving forward. As such, he sees now as a good opportunity to get into MJ as a fund with a high-dividend yield at a cheap price.

U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) Best ETFs for 2020: U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)

Investor:Vince Martin
Expense Ratio: 0.6%
Performance Through Q3: -45%

Out of all the picks in this contest, JETS has consistently performed the worst. As a fund with holdings based solely in the airline industry, it has done about as well as you might expect during a global pandemic. But according to Vince Martin — the one who picked it — the impact of the pandemic managed to highlight some of the other issues influencing the industry.

Martin says while it’s tempting to hop on JETS now and hope for a recovery in the long term, there’s reason this investment thesis falls apart: “In practice … cyclical stocks usually aren’t cheap enough at the top. With economic damage from the pandemic likely to linger, it’s going to take years simply for investors to get comfortable with the macroeconomic risk in the sector.”

When you combine this reality with the fact that the industry was poorly prepared for a potential threat that it had already anticipated (a pandemic), it’s clear why Martin is less optimistic about JETS as a comeback ETF for 2021. Only time will tell if the industry can regain its former strength. But for now, Martin suggests waiting on the sidelines.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JARED BLIKRE: I want to thank everybody for joining us for our fourth Yahoo Finance Premium webinar, Trading Election Year Odds and Managing Risk Amid Rising Uncertainty. I'm Jared Blikre.

And what a bout of uncertainty we've had recently. By October 6th yesterday, we'd had not one, but two October surprises. So we're going to be covering the following. What do these latest events mean for the markets? What happens with a contested election? What does a blue wave mean for your portfolio?

And to help us, we're soon going to be joined by Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist and senior VP at LPL Financial. He is a chartered market technician, CMT. So we're going to be covering lots of technicals, lots of fundamentals, lots of macro policy stuff, portfolio management, the Fed, and of course, lots and lots of stats.

We're also going to be demonstrating some of the features of our Yahoo Finance Premium service. This is how you can use it to find stocks that show signs of promising returns and also use it to analyze your portfolio and finetune it.

And now just a few notes on our webinar software, you're going to be able to interact with us in real time. That's because we're running Blue Jeans Secure Video Conferencing Platform, now part of Verizon.

And we're going to be running polls for the next 45 minutes, which you will see at the right hand tab of your screen. You can post questions at any time using that same tab at the right of your screen. And you can use your real name or just post anonymously.

Story continues

So, also, this is how you control the size of the various windows here. At the bottom left of your screen, you're going to see little sliders. And that's how you make the presenting screen bigger or smaller, as well as the video boxes for me and Ryan.

So let's get started. And I want to start out with a poll. Again, those are going to be on the right-hand side of your screen. And the first one is, the second most volatile month for stocks since 1990 is-- is it February, May, August, September, October, November, or December? We're going to have the results in a few minutes. So just make those selections now.

And I'm going to bring in Ryan Detrick. Ryan, thank you for joining us here. Great to have you. And I just wanted to begin-- I think you're muted there, Ryan. I just want to begin with market analysis because we have had some crazy price action over the last few days. Ryan, are you able to hear us?

RYAN DETRICK: Yes, I guess you guys muted me. And I didn't realize I had to unmute myself. So chalk that up for the first mistake, but that's the only mistake I'm going to make in 45 minutes. So yes, thank you for having me here.

JARED BLIKRE: All right. Everybody--

RYAN DETRICK: Appreciate it.

JARED BLIKRE: As I like to say, everybody gets one of those a month. Not your fault, anyway. But I want to take a look, and I'm going to share my screen here. We're going to take a look at the Qs. This is the ETF that tracks the NASDAQ 100. And we saw a really big reversal yesterday. Of course, we're up again today.

And just looking at this chart here, this is the daily candlestick chart. We've got some moving averages, the 20, the 50, the 200. It goes back to March so we can see the lows down here. It's been quite a run, but we've been in this consolidation for the last, what, six weeks now. What are you making of this latest price action, Ryan?

RYAN DETRICK: Well, I mean, the Qs, Jared, clearly, they're the leader of 2020. We know that, right? And just before this recent sell-off that we had, the Qs were more than 30% above that 200-day moving average, a geeky way of saying, that's an extremely stretched market. The most it's ever been stretched since when? Since 2000.

So you hear 2000, you start thinking, oh my goodness, bad stuff coming around the corner potentially. But we don't think that's the case because, again, you've got the Qs now just consolidating, catching its breath.

And we're going to talk about other parts of the market, but I'm not only looking at semiconductors. I mean, semiconductors are just a big part of technology in general. Relative strength versus the S&P, semiconductors are breaking out. Earnings have been strong in technology in general.

Now the Qs, it's not all technology, but believe me, it's a lot of technology. So, overall, we still say stick with who brought us to the dance, right? Stick with who brought us to the party. And that is some of the big cap names, some of the tech names. And let's not forget, we're in a low growth, low inflation, low rates world. That's probably not going to change the next 12 to 18 months, in our opinion.

And historically speaking, that is a tailwind for what? For growth because investors reach for growth. So you've got these tailwinds, in our view. They just got ahead of themselves. I mean, that's the truth. They got ahead of themselves because of the pandemic. But that's a group, you know, we still like. We still think the next 12 to 18 months will probably do pretty well for investors really.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, we've just got to get through these next four weeks. But I want to get to some seasonality here. Because that's a big part of the reason why a lot of people are here. Let's pull up election year seasonality.

And we're going to pull a-- we're going to take a question from the audience here. This is from Bryant. And he's asking, what does history say about the market returns from October to December in election years and the returns in Q1 the following year? So we have this chart out that you have prepared. Any people might remember it from Twitter because I've seen it making the rounds here. Can you set it up for us?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah, I mean, you know, so there's different ways to break it down. And this one, I broke it down by election year and if a president's up for re-election. The bottom line here is, ahead of the election and during an election year, October, the very month of October, is actually the worst month of the year on average.

Now you can see on the chart there, when you're up for re-election, maybe there's a little bit more sideways consolidation. But still, it's kind of the way it works out. It makes sense. People a little skittish ahead of the election. There's some reasons maybe to sell.

And we wouldn't be shocked at all if that were the case once again. We've got a lot of-- we've had the sell-off, I guess, in September, now more volatility. And it's amazing how much we've bounced back today versus what just happened yesterday, 24 hours ago.

But, you know, you talk about the fourth. I know we're going to get some other slides coming up. But the fourth quarter historically is a pretty good quarter. It's pretty good during an election year also. The reality of the fact is the market tends to be weak until that election. Then whoever wins, right-- Republican, Democrat-- whatever usually happens, once that-- the market hates uncertainty. We've all heard that time and time again.

What we've been telling our LPL advisors is, use any weakness as an opportunity to potentially have that end of year rally that you tend to see more often than not during an election year. And that's what we're kind of expecting to play out once again because of the underlying fundamentals of this economy.

They're not great, but they're improving and earnings are looking pretty good next year. So those are all big positives, we think, that continue to be a buyer of dips in this current market environment.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, you got to imagine a lot of those comps are going to be pretty interesting over the following fourth quarters at least. But we brought up another slide here. And this kind of builds on what you were saying. In year 4, there's actually-- we usually have gains in all four quarters. So what is this? How does this fit with your other work.

RYAN DETRICK: I guess we didn't have a gain the first quarter of this year, though, did we? [CHUCKLES] We've been down 20%, then up 20% the second quarter, and another big gain in the third quarter. But what we like to point out is the average. And what's the old saying? There's no such thing as-- you know, there's no such thing as average really if think about it.

There's the statistician that put his head in a bucket of ice and his feet in the oven. They said, how do you feel? He goes, well, on average, I feel pretty good, right? I mean, he's still-- I'm aware there's no such thing as average.

But still, the average fourth quarter gains about 4%, now you can see on the screen there, when you break it down by presidential cycle, the fourth year of the presidential cycle, S&P gains about 2%. You say oh, that's kind of weaker than normal. Maybe there's some truth to that, but it's actually higher 82% of the time. Just a couple of big drops kind of skew things.

So bigger picture, as uncertain as all elections usually are-- and this year, specifically this one-- the fourth quarter of election year is higher 82% of the time, which, as you see, you know, is one of the more likely quarters out of the four-year cycle out of 16 quarters to actually be higher. And we think that probably plays out again here in 2020.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and we've seen-- well, just four years ago we had that meteoric rise after President Trump was elected. And that's after S&P futures crashed limit down the night of the election. But he seemed to be banking on a different outcome or result.

But I want to move on to our poll results. So the second most volatile month for stocks since 1990 is-- the biggest winner here is October, followed by September. In actuality, it's November. And can we put up the October volatility slide that we have here, guys?

And this shows-- this is going to show the average VIX performance since inception in 1990 through 2019. And we can see September, October, November all elevated. So pretty close there, guys. And Ryan, what is this representing to you? 'Cause we're not just talking about election year here. We're talking about this pocket of volatility-- September, October, November. Well, how do you interpret this?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, you know, you had spectacular crashes in October. We all know '29. We all know '87, 2008. You know, October 2011 was one of the greatest monthly gains we've ever seen. So October, it gets a bad rap in my view.

If you look at average performance, it's about the seventh best month on average for stocks. So it's not great, but it's not this terrible month either, but it is volatile. You've got the VIX there, you know, that shows the high VIX usually. You also have more 1% moves either up or down in the month of October than any other month.

And believe me, you can ask 10 people why October? You know, I know a lot of hedge funds in-- believe me, there is no hedge funds back in the crash of '29. Let's get that clear. But now you've got a lot of hedge funds that fiscal year ends the end of September.

You know, the fourth quarter is normally strong, so maybe some skittishness. And then you get to the feel good time of November and December. It's tough to pinpoint one reason why the reality those investors that we've been telling our more than 17,000 LPL Advisors. We say, listen, it is what it is. October can be volatile. You get your October surprise-- and we've got a couple of them so far.

And let's hope maybe the next October surprise is maybe positive news on a vaccine or major-- more therapeutic breakthroughs. That'd be a nice October surprise, wouldn't it? But still, it's just kind of one of those things that you don't want to ignore. I mean, Mark Twain, you know, said history does repeat, but it rhymes. Well, a volatile October is what we tend to see more often than not, and that's something to be aware of as investors.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. And I think that came from ""Pudd'nhead Wilson."" All right, we're going to go to another poll here.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. He steals all the good quotes. I say Mark Twain, I think he gets credit for all of them. He and, you know, some of the famous generals, they didn't really say them, but I give him credit. [LAUGHS]

JARED BLIKRE: Sounds good. Here is our second poll-- how long have you been trading stocks? One year or less? One to three years? Three to 10 years? 10 years or more? We ask this at every webinar just trying to gauge the audience in the room, and what your experience level is with stocks.

So now we're going to take another question here. This one's from Hank. ""What industry or industries have better value before or after the election?"" And I'm just going to start with this one. And the way I see it is September was a month-- we had a big sell off and then consolidation.

And I think that was simply repricing election risk that really haven't been priced in up until then. And that's one of the things we've seen over the last four years, I would say. What the first time I really noticed this was Brexit-- how fast things get repriced in the market.

You know, we're coming off the fastest bear market in history. We've-- at various times, this has been the fastest bull market in history. And what we're seeing now is possible expansion of the yield curve. And so that would be kind of the blue wave that we have Democrats in Congress, both houses, as well as presidents. And if that's a play, you're going to have an expanding yield curve, and you're going to bet on infrastructure. So that's materials, industrials.

And we saw those sectors-- we've seen them come into rotation in fits and starts throughout this entire rally. But I would say more so recently. And Ryan, what are your thoughts on this?

RYAN DETRICK: Oh, we agree, not to mention small caps. I mean, small caps and other kind of get the economy going better times ahead potentially. And they they've started to show some leadership. But I kind of mentioned earlier, you know, we like technology. That's where a lot of the growth is coming from. We like communication services.

But I mean, who's-- why do you have to pick one or two sectors, right? We're saying, like, do a barbell approach. Stick with some of those leaders-- your communication or technology. And then over here, you've got those cyclicals that you said.

We like industrials. We like materials. We don't like banks as much. I know if the yield curve goes up, that's supposed to help bank's financials. But still we're a little lukewarm on that group. So those are kind of two-barbelled approach where if the economy is slowed and move a lot, we know the playbook. That's going to help technology and big caps over here.

But if things keep opening it, and we get a vaccine, and then the economy keeps surprising to the upside, which honestly-- I know the employment date has been weak-- most the other economic data, though, has surprised to the upside. It makes sense, kind of in our view, to kind of a barbell approach and, you know, benefit both ways, potentially.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Good commentary there. While you were talking, I was flipping through some charts. And I just want to kind of explain how these fit into the macro picture here. We're looking at the 10-year treasury yield.

I think what's most obvious here is we've just been in this incredible consolidation. And I'm going to try and draw a straight line here, but you can just see it's been in a box. Yes, we went above and a few places and probably below as well, but it didn't last long. And that means we've had this-- we've had this run up in treasury yields over the last three, four sessions, and it could very well we reverse at these levels. And we've seen them reverse before right around here.

So the rotation that we've seen in the last few weeks in fits and starts around these cyclicals, that could continue. But if yields are dropped back down, and that's going to be-- that's going to favor those big growth names, some mega caps like Apple, Amazon, Tesla. You throw that in as a FANG stock note too, those stocks did very well and were the go-to choice when interest rates were dropping. And that's because in a growth-- you want growth stocks when you have a low-interest environment.

It gets into there is no alternative and a bunch of other things. But in general, when you have dropping interest rates and a contracting yield curve, you're going to see defensive names like utilities outperform because they're interest rate proxies and then those big cap growth names. And on the way up, that's when you see the rotation into industrials. And I think that's-- and some other, maybe some value plays.

You know, pick and choose here, but I think that's what we're seeing is the anticipation that we could have an expanding yield curve. And we're preparing for that now, but it's not going to be a straight line. Even if the index tends to go up from the lower-- from the lower left to the upper right in the individual sectors, it's going to be rotation. It's not going to be easy.

All right, let's do this. Let's read the results of the last poll. So 35% of you have one year or less experience trading. 30% of one to three years. And three-- excuse me-- 22% have three to 10 years. And 13% have 10 years or more. So the most popular answer-- one to three years, all right?

And we do have another poll. And I think we might have given away the answer, but that's fine. This is poll number three. The historically best quarter for stocks in any given year is, is it the first quarter? Second quarter? Third quarter? Or fourth quarter? And we're going to be taking that poll down in a couple of minutes here.

Ryan, I want to bring you back in and just talk about-- and talk about the current bull market because you have an-- guys, can you pull up big third quarter? We have a slide that shows when we have big gains in the third quarter, they oftentimes translate to the fourth quarter. How does this fit in with the discussion we were having previously with the seasonality?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. Well, first off, on the recent poll, I did give it away. So sorry about that. But this is-- I guess we'll know how closely everyone's paying attention because I did give away the answer on what quarter's the best one. So we'll see.

But yeah, I mean, you know, historically, the third quarter is not that great, OK? That is usually what we see is usually a weak third quarter that we had anything but that this year in 2020 where stocks gained up over 8%. The S&P gained up over 8% in the normally weakish third quarter.

We'd have to think-- I'm like, you know, what does that mean? Is that given any clue, any sign what might happen the fourth quarter, which again is normally pretty good? Sure enough, as you see on the screen, every single time we've had stocks in the third quarter up 7 and 1/2%, the fourth quarter has been higher, and actually by pretty wide margin a lot of times.

So I think it's just the market's way of saying, something's going on. And we don't necessarily know what, but something's going on under the surface as this normally weak time does well. You mentioned your yields. I want to go on that for a second because you had a good discussion on yields.

Remember back on-- I guess it was what? The last new high, was it May 2-- or I'm sorry, January 21. I think-- oh, so sorry-- February, February 21, S&P made a new all-time high, the last new all-time high until the 34% correction. The bond market was freaking out most of February, meaning freaking out as in yields were dropping significantly.

Everybody-- all the stock guys were looking around, like, what's the bond market worried about? Stocks are making new highs. Everything's great. Well, the bond market was worried.

But now what you see with the 10-year yield, it's not breaking down again. In fact, it's kind of starting to breakout. So the stock guys get a little worried here. Ah, too far, too fast, or sees concerns. Now, the bond guys aren't so worried.

And that's a really good sign. Some people say bond guys are the smartest guys in the room. I kind of believe that to a degree. And they're not as worried now, right? Credit spreads-- don't want to get too geeky, but credit spreads have really come down.

So the most hit industries have been devastated by this thing have been-- their credit spreads have come down. So there's some confidence coming into the fixed income world on the economy. And that's something I wouldn't necessarily want to bet against. Though the bond guys are right back when we had the big worry, now maybe if the economy's better, maybe the bond guys will be right once again here.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. That's a great explanation, Ryan. And it kind of fits in. I just want to take a couple more questions about bonds since we're on the topic. And one here is 10-year treasury yields. ""You mentioned that 10-year treasury yields are rising. What is your view for the next six months to a year?"" And one other, ""how can one justify investing in bonds when the interest rates are so low and can go and only go up?""

Well, I'm going to take that first. I'm going to say they can go down again. We could have some deflationary stock. Any number of things could happen in the coming quarters. Not expecting another full lockdown, but some of the ancillary knock-on effects of what happened before the economic shutdown, those might propagate through the system. Commercial real estate, the Fed has been looking at that.

You also take a look at some of the other economic indicators. Jobs-- we're just seeing huge layoffs, potentially in the airlines; Disney, 20,000, something like that. So my view over the next six months is interest-- I expect longer term rates to rise, but slowly. It's going to be fits and starts.

It's going to be a long time to break out of this pattern or this holding pattern we've seen since April. But when they do, probably going to be big. Your thoughts, Ryan?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, agree. We're looking for higher rates, too. Now, there's been a lot of people have been talking about higher rates for years. Anything but that has happened. But, you know, I mean, I like to talk about cooper. I don't know if you can pull up a chart of copper or not while I'm doing this. If not, it's OK.

But copper has been really strong, OK, so far the last, several months. In copper, they call it like a Dr. Copper. So goes copper, goes the economy. He's got a PhD in the economy. I get it. China buys like half of the world's coppers, and China is coming back online.

But it's very hard for us at LPL Research to be bearish, the economy or bearish to global economy when copper is doing well. And when you think about it also, copper historically is kind of correlated with the 10-year yield, which is kind of where I'm going with this conversation now. If copper's been strong, we think the yields will eventually follow copper's lead here. And that'll push yields higher.

So from that fixed income point of view, there's always a place for bonds in a portfolio, especially an uncertain world like we're living in now. But if you're going to have higher yields, the way we're looking at it here at LPL Research with the money that we run for our advisors, we're shortening up duration. Things won't be as impacted by a higher surge in yield prices; also buying a little bit higher quality here.

We do like mortgage-backed securities as a potential play on officially higher yields going forward. And I do think copper is giving us that signal potentially on yields will probably a good deal higher 6 to 12 months from now.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Good stuff. Well, I want to turn to the VIX. And if, guys, you could scroll up the VIX curve, it slide six here. Everybody's been talking about volatility. We've known for some time because we have VIX futures contracts that settle in every month-- January through December.

Those prices for October, November, December have been elevated for some time. And what this is showing is the VIX curve. And that's all these monthly four dates that we're talking about. So basically the beginning of September versus October.

So the cyan line that's higher in the beginning, that was September. And we could see there was priced in more volatility then we are currently pricing in right now. And this is versus what happened a month ago.

But you can still see here that the VIX expectations going out are now more. So there's greater volatility than a month ago expected for the future. Ryan, how are you viewing volatility right now? And your expectations for the next couple of quarters.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. Well, it makes sense, I think. I mean, there's just so much uncertainty out there. You're willing to pay up a little bit of a premium. Remember the VIX is a function of option prices. And I traded options for about 11 years before it came in the world of money management working with advisors like I do now.

So starting to kind of makes sense is a way to put it. And you know, I hear the VIX, and it's like, you know, known as the fear gauge. And I'm not crazy about that name on the VIX. But there's other ways to look at market sentiment. I mean, various sentiment polls, they're still showing investors are kind of skeptical, right?

I mean, look at fund flows. I mean, there's still not a lot of people jumping hands over-- hand over foot, hand over fist, or whatever the the saying is-- to kind of get into equities here. And you know, that's from that contrarian point of view, maybe a bigger term picture positive. But at the same time, it just-- you know, with-- let's be honest, are we really going to have a president on November 4?

You know, we probably will. But the chances of some type of an argument back and forth is very high. And what do we see in 2000 when we had to wait til, I think it was December 12th, until we got the official winner of the election. Well, we saw about a 10% correction in the S&P 500.

So now that was also late 2000. That was a recession. There were different things happening. But it was the uncertainty that is just swirling and kind of continues to swirl again. Just last 24 hours, fiscal plan is off. Forget about it, we're just going to put this on the Supreme Court now.

Oh, no, never mind, here's $1,200 checks for people. That's not official, but that's-- it's just amazing at how quickly things change in this wharf we're in right now. And it's not really a laughing matter because it's unbelievable when you're talking real people's money. But at the same time, I think the market is willing to pay a little bit of a premium for any type of craziness that we're going to see either next month or so before the election or even a couple months after the election when anything is going to be very clear, I think, unfortunately.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I'd have to agree with you there. I'm sure Mark Twain has a quote about that too somewhere.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah, he said--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

RYAN DETRICK: --Mark Twain, he said, October is the most dangerous month for equities. The others are February, January, December, August, November. It's something along those lines. Mark's got them all. He's a-- he's a good guy.

JARED BLIKRE: [LAUGHS] You can always safely attribute anything to him.

RYAN DETRICK: Yes.

JARED BLIKRE: All right. We got-- I want to play-- since we're talking about potential surprises about volatility, I want to play a clip from Ian Bremmer who was on one of our shows. This was a couple weeks ago, but he's highlighting some surprises, potential surprises that haven't happened. Let's take a listen.

IAN BREMMER: What happens if there is a financial crisis involving emerging markets that are having a really hard time at a time when the president and the administration would need to agree on a major external bailout? That's a lot harder to do when we don't-- when we're fighting immensely over what just happened with the election. What happens if the Chinese government decides to change facts on the ground in Taiwan, or the Russians do in Belarus, or the Iranians do with the Straits of Hormuz, or the Turks do in the Eastern Med?

In other words, I think that there is an exceptional period of risk, both domestically and globally, in those weeks to months when we don't actually know what the outcome of the election is going to be. And I think that there's real market volatility that can come around that. I mean, the story of the pandemic has been just how strong the American market's have been. Not clearly we're going to feel that level of confidence when we're fighting over this election outcome. And we need clarity on what direction our government is actually headed.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. So I'm going to put up a chart of the EER emerging markets ETF by iShares. And we can see that we've been consolidating sideways since July. So this is basically at least three months. And maybe we're breaking out right now. It looks like the RSI's only 60, but might have the momentum to do it. What are your thoughts, Ryan, on what Ian Bremmer just said and emerging markets here and potential risks?

RYAN DETRICK: Well, I'll just say this-- that share behind Ian looked really comfortable. I was like, why's he not sitting in that chair? [LAUGHS] But no, you know-- sorry. You know, at LPL Research, we like emerging markets. I mean, we're bullish. I can't disagree with anything he said.

I mean, those worries and those concerns are absolutely there. Yet when you talk about emerging markets, you know, a lot of it comes down to the US dollar, in our view, the US dollar is in a major structural shift where it's going to go lower. You look at the dollar, for 16-year cycles, the dollar kind of makes major peaks, OK?

In '85, the dollar made a major peak. In 2001, the dollar made a major peak. 16 years later is 2017. The dollar made a major peak, and I know we had that big spike in March we were the dash for trash, never went to the dollar. But since then, it's obviously weakened.

So if the dollar goes lower for the next three or four years, which is kind of our base case at LPL Research with lower rates, and, you know, it's got some of the bigger structural concerns all the deficits that we have, the dollar going down benefits global stock markets, specifically emerging markets. And again, I guess you still call China an emerging market, although I'm not so crazy about that, but you do. They're still a big part of it.

China's growth is really coming back. I know nobody really trust Chinese data. I get it, but I trust what Hyatt said. Hyatt said more people are staying in hotels now than they were back in September before everything really got bad, in China, at least. So they're coming back online. And that is a big part of kind of why we like emerging markets.

You talk about-- we like the US, too. But where would a global investor go? We say emerging markets overdeveloped international, specifically Europe there. We still like emerging markets. That's where the growth is coming from.

There's good valuation. There's risk. There's always risk in emerging markets, no doubt about it. But with China really coming back, that's a risk we were willing to take in the portfolios that we run for our advisors.

JARED BLIKRE: And a weaker dollar generally good for risk markets in general.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah.

JARED BLIKRE: We were just showing that-- we were just showing that slide that you put together that shows how US dollar can predict the presidential outcome. And I think it's very much inversely what we're seeing with-- there we go-- inversely what we're seeing with stocks. So we don't have to go over the details, though. But a weaker dollar, risk on, tends to predict the election in some way. Fair to say? All right--

RYAN DETRICK: No, exactly--

JARED BLIKRE: Go ahead.

RYAN DETRICK: Go ahead, sorry. Probably just say that if the dollar goes up a lot between now and the election, that doesn't bode well for President Trump. If the dollar weakens, that bodes well for President Trump. That's what history has told us when you follow the US dollar in the currency markets. And that's kind of what it is. So pay attention to the currency market.

One thing along 2016-- I was going to say this earlier-- the Dow was down nine days in a row directly ahead of the 2016 election. Copper, the industrial metal of copper, was up a record 14 straight days before that election in 2016. Everyone, including LPL Research, thought Hillary Clinton is going to win.

Not the stock market. If the stock market's weak ahead of the election, that tends to bode well for a new party or new power in the White House. And copper was an industrial play based for President Trump, right, some type of infrastructure plan. It didn't really happened, but that was the place. So the markets were telling us a wildly different scenario than what every expert was telling us.

And I'd rather pay attention to the markets. And that's why paying attention the dollar and stocks and yields, all these different things might give a clue who's in the White House or who wins the election in November, but officially in the White House next January.

JARED BLIKRE: That's some great insight there. I want to go over the results from one of our previous polls. And this was the historically best quarter for stocks in any given year is, was it the first quarter? 14% said, yes. Then that, second quarter? 17%; third? 7%; fourth quarter? 62%. That is the right answer. Good job, guys.

All right, so now our next poll here. Let's see-- pull forward, the top source for my trading decisions is-- free advisory service, paid advisory or a subscription service, Twitter or message boards, financial media, my own research. We're going to go over that-- the results for that in a second.

Well, now, I want to take a few minutes to go over Yahoo Finance Premium. And I just wanted to kind of overview what's available. We're going to take a look at the value of diversification, risk level, analysis that it provides, and then get into some concrete examples of how it selects trades or potential trades in various tickers here.

All right, I'm just going to share my screen, and we'll be up and running. All right, so this is what you'll see when you log in. This is the desktop. And I have a portfolio here. I created it arbitrarily just over a year ago. We can see it's outperforming the S&P 500.

[INAUDIBLE] is being heavily loaded with FANG stocks, so actually outperforming by quite a nice margin. And it will give you fair value readings for your various constituents in there. It will also give you, what we have here on the left, research reports. These are fundamental reports by Argus Research. They will make buying/selling decisions.

And the company outlook-- we have various fields here. Pretty-- this is unique. I will say I haven't seen this before. You can examine a company, for instance, like Netflix on several different scenarios just looking at this simple graph on dividends, innovation, hiring, sustainability, earnings.

And then we have technical events for the short, medium, and long term. And we're going to take a look at a few stocks in the second here. But in general, we also have the insights. I find this particularly interesting and useful because if you click into, for instance, risk level, we're going to see this down here. You can get a measure of your entire portfolio.

Is it over-- is it overallocated to one area? And maybe that's what you want. But maybe you don't know, and maybe you should know. That we have portfolio risk measures that go historically either monthly or more often. And also, measures of volatility and beta of the portfolio to the market. That's how far it moves relative to a given move in a benchmark.

So let's now take out a couple stocks. And what I want to do is go to our investment ideas. If you watch programs, and see me on a day-to-day basis, I do one of these usually every day. And we'll see if I can get this going here. It's like my browser's a little slow.

OK. Investment ideas. And so let's take a look at some of these ideas here. We have-- we can filter them by idea. Type fundamental or technical. Take a look at one of each of them, how long term, short, medium, and long term. What sector?

You can have multiple portfolios here where you import your entire portfolio from your broker's account. It's actually very, very simple. You can also do it by date range. So we'll just pull up Wayfair. This is an idea that was generated today, October 7.

They're boosting the target price to $360. They have a bunch of reasons here. If you want to look at a chart, easy enough to do. You can 22% potential if they do make that target. And here's what you would see in Wayfair. These are one-month candles, but you can just see how they've been on incredible tear since those March lows for the most part.

Let's take a look at a technical position here or recommendation. I think I was looking at one here. Oh, Vidu's always interesting. Take a look at Vidu. So we have a description of what it's doing.

It has a bottoming triangle, bottoming wedge. Then they have a price target for it. So we view it in a chart. What I really like here is it shows you the pattern. So you can see here where the triangle exactly is.

And you can see it's just barely budging to the upside here, but hasn't got off the ground just yet. It means there is still opportunity in the pattern. And if you wanted to set, for instance, some risk measurement price levels here, I would probably look under one of these moving averages. If you want to be ultra conservative, view below 118. That's a 200 day. But you can put it higher there theoretically too maybe underneath this to around maybe 123, 122, something in there.

Also, on the right side of the screen, it will tell you exactly what's going on; what the pattern means, event descriptions. So it kind of hold your hands there, too. Pretty interesting.

All right. So we're going to move on. And we're going to resu-- here's the results of our last poll-- top funding-- top source for my trading decisions is pre-advisory service, 5%; paid advisory, 9%; Twitter message board, 0%-- nobody falling into that trap. That's good. I like to hear that-- financial media, 18%. My own research is the top vote-getter.

So that's impressive. It's always important to do your own research. I think you'd agree with that, Ryan, although you can rely on other people. But I just want to bring you back into this discussion and talk about sector performance, again. I think we have some questions relating to that.

So we talked about these rotation into value cyclicals. There's a lot of talk about that, but what about hedging? Is there-- are things people can do in maybe derivatives like stock options? Some people want to know if they should simply buy bonds.

How do you-- how do you hedge risk in this time? And we're only talking about the next few months until the election is sorted out, Ryan.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, you know, we'd probably say, stay away from doing options unless you have, you know, a professional potential to help you. But the easiest way is maybe add a little more bonds. There's nothing wrong with losing a little bit of cash also. And gold, we talk about the dollar going lower. Structurally, that should be a potential positive for gold.

So you know, everybody-- in March, when gold was getting killed; bonds were getting killed; stocks were getting killed; everything was getting killed, everybody was wondering what to do. And a lot of people sold near the lows. And then you look back, it's like, man, if I just wouldn't use that as an opportunity to kind of rebalance my portfolio and not panic, I might have had a really wonderful buying opportunity, looking back.

So it's so important to kind of have that, you know, longer term-- I mean, everybody becomes a trader on a pullback. Long-term investors become traders on pullbacks. And I believe me, I know there's a lot of traders listen to this right now. But for those longer term investors, it's just unique the way you need to use it.

And you know, this-- but to that poll just for a second If I could, you know, with our advisors, what we've seen in 2020, right, everything's been hyper drive. The way technology, the way we communicate, everything's been hyper drive.

And what we found with our advisors, some of the most successful-- and this is not just the world of financial advisors; it's the world in general-- are the most nimble-- the ones that are built-- have the ability to adapt to the surroundings around them. You know, just the fact that we're doing this, you know, virtually now, we didn't necessarily do as many these things.

And we're doing webinars all the time, Webex in blue jeans, and all these different ways to communicate. There's parts of the economy that are struggling. There's no doubt. 28,000 people at Disney just lost their jobs last couple of weeks. That is devastating.

But at the same time, there are other parts of the economy that are really picking up. And whether it be financial services or any other area, it's the ones that are nimble and able to adapt it have really, really succeeded. And we've seen with it our advisors. We've seen it around the world.

And that's going-- there's going to be another recession. There's going to be more problems. All right, can you adapt, and are you nimble are the two most-- two of the most popular-- not popular-- two of the most important things you need to do to continue to be successful, in our view.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. That's an excellent point because nobody expected that we were going to descend into the fastest bear market in history. And almost nobody at the bottom thought we'd be reaching record highs within a few months. So being nimble, important, keep your mind open, and also recognizing that these market cycles last many years, on a secular time frame, maybe 10 years, but they change.

You know, we have brand new leadership this year. This reminds me, even in March and April when the Fed first came out with the bazooka, you know, 10 emergency programs, that it reminded of 2009 because we took off, thanks to QE1 that year, which was really implemented in March. And the analog, it just in terms of the S&P 500 price right there.

And I remember being in that environment in 2009 when names I'd never heard of like Lululemon. But I thought it was pronounced Lululemon 'cause they didn't have any locations near me. But all these early leaders that ended up being later leaders, they were kind of born in that market cycle. And that's what we're seeing now. We're just seeing a repricing of a lot of that, the expectations for the new economy. And like it or not, we are in a new economy.

You mentioned jobs, Ryan. I want to get to a clip we have Eric Rosengren. He's a New York Fed Governor. And he's talking about the jobless situation. Let's take a listen.

ERIC ROSENGREN: I am very worried that we're pretty far away from what we think is maximum employment. And I think there are going to be significant headwinds to getting there quickly. So I have a somewhat more pessimistic forecast than my colleagues that you could have seen from this summary of economic projections that the FOMC recently put out. They're expecting that the unemployment rate will get below 6% by the end of next year. I'm not expecting that.

And some of the headwinds include the problems with re-employing people. So I am worried that many of temporary layoffs are starting to turn to permanent, as the pandemic drags on much longer than people expected earlier this year. So I think that's going to be a challenge in particularly the segments of the labor market that are being impacted.

So if you think about travel, if you think about tourism, if you think about restaurants, if you think about retail, those are areas where a lot of payroll employment increased over the course of the summer. But continued progress is really going to require that the pandemic be tamed to the degree that people can be fully employed; people feel comfortable once again going to restaurants and hotels.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I think the bottom line for me is we have no idea what to expect. Things can change on a dime. And people are going to get maybe more unemployment checks. But I think the big picture overall is there's going to be restructuring, and we're going to be retraining.

All right, before we go, I want to get to our next subject, which has to do with presidential health scares. That's something that happened recently. Probably not going to be a long-term impact here. It looks like President Trump is recovering out of Walter Reed, Monday. But I do want to cover this.

So our sixth poll-- and we're going to get to this answer right here in the segment-- is the most severe stock market reaction to a US presidential health scare over the last century is-- is it Warren G. Harding when he died? FDR when he died? Dwight D. Eisenhower, heart attack? JFK, assassinated? Ronald Reagan, shot? Donald Trump, COVID?

And I went through the numbers here, Ryan. I went back through history. And it doesn't really look like much ever happens off of presidential health care. And that was kind of in line with what I thought because these aren't structural risks to the economy.

It's-- you know, unless somebody is a cult of personality here, like the leader of an authoritarian dictatorship, I wouldn't expect it to have much. But if we can put that slide up-- yeah, we have it right here-- you can just see the number of days to the bottom, usually one or two. We do have that exception with Dwight D. Eisenhower's heart attack.

But aside from that, these tend to be one-off events. And I would say-- I do want to cover this, too. The potential-- if something happens to President Trump between now and Inauguration Day, what happens, especially election day? Because millions of people who've already voted-- it's hard to handicap this scenario.

I think you'd have a lot of legal risk, probably a lot of wrangling the courts. But I think we'd figure it out. And Ryan, I do want to get your thoughts on know what kind of surprises here we might see.

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. Well, sounds like the Heisman, right? People will vote for the Heisman before the season is over. Then some guy's like, great game at the end. You're like, man, I should have voted for him.

But you know, if you think about it, when JFK was tragically shot and killed, you know what the S&P 500 did? It went up the next eight straight months, one of the longest monthly win streaks that we've ever seen. I mean, so it is terrible, terrible what happened. But again, whoever wins this election is going to get the keys to a really solid economy, in our view, an improving economy. Is not a rip roaring. I mean, the segment just played from the Fed chair-- from the Fed chairperson there-- or Fed-- who was it? Rosengren--

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah.

RYAN DETRICK: --from him talking about the jobs, I mean, I agree. Like, believe me, jobs are the big issue. I mean, they're not coming back as much as we would have thought. Yet, go look at consumer confidence, which has had one of its largest jumps ever, which, historically speaking, end recessions.

You've got housing. Existing home sales, new home sales, 14-year highs. I mean, there are-- you can pick parts of the economy that aren't doing great, but there are some other parts that really are. I want to summarize with one more big picture thing. It's called the seven-year itch.

If you look back historically, there's a bull market, in my opinion, that started in 1950. Seven years in, in 1957, 20% correction and a recession. You know what happened after that? Kept going up to 1966-- seven years in and had that bear market.

In my opinion, the bull market didn't start in '82. It started in 1980. That's when the S&P broke out to new highs for the first time in 1980. Do the math. Seven years later, that's 1987-- big time correction. And then what happened? Another 13 years of gains.

Right now, this bull market, in my opinion-- or the previous bull market, in my opinion-- did not start in 2009. It started in 2013 when we broke out to new highs after a range of over a decade. You add seven years to 2013, what do you get? 2020.

Just had a bear market. Just had a recession. History would tell us, potentially, if we follow those two other scenarios, there could still be years left of this major secular bull market with higher prices. And in my opinion, that's what I think is the case. People keep doubting this bull market. There are concerns, but this recession isn't like the other ones.

This one stopped because we had to, 'cause there's a devastating, devastating, you know, virus that is impacting us. At the same time, the economy was in pretty good shape heading in. What's credit card debt done during this recession? It's gone down.

We gave people money. They didn't go out and spend and waste it-- maybe some people did. But credit card debts' come down. There are some-- there are some positives that have taken place. There aren't many. I mean, I know there's a lot of negatives.

But bigger picture, the seven-year itch-- whether it be relationships, your job, or the stock market, you get these corrections in seven years. And then you can have years to go. And I just think that's something really important that a lot of people don't understand. And it made sense that 2020 had this correction.

34% in six weeks? I didn't think I'd be that fast. But some type of correction in 2020 made sense. And that's where we are so far at least.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. All very good observations. And I would add one thing you brought up was definition of bull market. There are several different ones. The financial media tends to use just one, which is the S&P 500, 20% correct or 20% downdraft on a close-to-close basis.

We missed that by a fraction in 2011; I think in 2018, too. So a lot of it's arbitrary. But I like the way you look at the market. And I want to get to at least one more question before we have to end this here. How do you spot money flowing into a stock before it takes off?

And I just want to pull up some charts here. And there are a couple of different ways-- not couple, there's dozens. Maybe there is an infinite number of ways. We're looking at DraftKings right here. And it was towards the beginning of the year-- I think it was in January.

This was a SPAC deal. So you actually had the opportunity to buy this back before we got-- before the deal was actually done. But just relationships with moving averages, I think that's one way of looking at it. When you have the price extended beyond it, you have a lot of money coming into it, and you have chart formations. That's another way of looking at it.

Though, if you get to another high with-- either different ways of looking at this. But let's say you're retesting a high, there are certain technical indications where that may say, we can break out of this. I'd like to look at RSI as kind of a momentum indicator. You can use MACD. You can use CCI, lots of ways to look at this.

Palantir, this is a really interesting stock. This just went live through a direct listing a few days ago. But for here, I'm using Anchored VWAP. And that's basically the Volume-Weighted Average Price. And you can do it through an indicator. And this is free on our site, not even premium, under all indicators Anchored VWAP.

And I have two lines on here. So this is measuring the average supply and demand. Are people making money? Are the longs making money? Are the shorts making money? If It's below the shorts are making money, it's pretty interesting.

And you can start this from different locations. So we got two now from the very first bar to the 30-minute bars on Palantir. And then from the low, and you can see the prices started to use this lower Anchored VWAP from this date right here at 10/6, the open it's using as support.

And now it's breaking above. So it looks like Palantir is getting a little bullish to me, just based on this analysis. So there's lots to look at here. And I love trading, as I hope it's-- as I hope everybody can tell.

And I think, Ryan, you're in the same camp. How do you look-- how do you look at the markets? And pick any ticker you want, and we can just take a look at it here before we go.

RYAN DETRICK: Well, I mean, I used to trade, like I said more, short term, looking at options. I'm now more of a bigger picture macro thinker. And I agree with a lot of the things you just said. At the same time, I like to use relative strength.

I mentioned, you know, semiconductors earlier-- like SMH. If you look at the semiconductor SMH versus the S&P 500, it's breaking out, right? Relative strength, it's outperforming, more than it ever has, the S&P 500. To me, those are the signs and the clues that we see we're looking for big sectors or sector ETFs that potentially can start to do well.

I mean, price action hasn't made a new high quite yet, but you've already got the breakout. And then you look at things like Advance-Decline Line, you know how, many stocks going up versus down, just yesterday, or two days ago-- sorry-- just two days ago, the S&P 500's Advance-Decline Line made a new all-time high.

People tell us that just a few stocks are leading this thing higher. Yeah, they're pulling it higher to a degree. But there's a lot more small caps out there. They're starting to do better. There's a lot of beaten up things that are doing better. So that is participation.

You see Advance-Decline Lines peak anywhere between 10 to 14 months before the actual indices peak. We just made new highs on the S&P 500's Advance-Decline Line two days ago. That would suggest again, if we do this in six months or a year from now, we're probably would have higher prices because that's just kind of what history tells us.

There is participation there with the credit markets and credit spreads still being low there's. Two things I like to follow at the end of the day-- advance decline lines and what do the credit spreads tell me? Advance-Decline Lines are strong, and the credit markets are still quite calm. Those are two reasons I think the fundamentals are still there and the technicals are still there. So this upward trajectory is very, very much in play.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I love looking at those Advance-Decline Lines myself. And kind of a warning sign when we saw them getting into a short-term downtrend. Meanwhile, the market was still by its all-time highs.

So I'm going to review the results of our last poll before we go here. And this was the most severe stock market reaction to a US presidential health scare over the last century. And people guessed, in the highest numbers, 41% for JFK. But the right answer was Dwight D. Eisenhower. That was a heart attack. 18%, though, did guess correctly.

All right, I've been saying we're going to go pretty soon, and it's for real now. But I want to get to this one last viewer question. ""What is--"" and this is by Alusis-- ""what is one book you would recommend that is unrelated to trading, but help build the foundation to your trading?""

That's a good one. I'm going to answer first 'cause I saw that one coming-- ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" It's one of those staples of kind of business management and personal growth seminars, whatever. But I think that kind of got me in a decent mindset to appreciate the psychological effects of trading, which are different than just about everything else, but it's a different approach. How about you, Ryan?

RYAN DETRICK: Yeah. I mean, you know, I read just a lot of financial books. I'm trying to think-- anything Ben Carlson writes or Morgan Housel. I mean, those two are just some of the greatest financial minds. And they're not always writing about trading and what you should do with investments and things.

But anything those guys do, kind of a new way-- like, you know, where do you get your information? Well, I get it from Twitter or something like that. There is absolutely, though-- what those guys are doing, they've had some books come out recently. I would highly recommend anything those guys do, I think.

JARED BLIKRE: All right. Now, we're going to end on that note. I want to thank everybody for attending here. We do these once a month on the first Tuesday at 2:00 PM of every month. So we're going to be back here in November. And I'm sure we're going to be talking about the elections right around then.

We'll have to see if we have a president. Nobody knows. Again, thank you, everybody, for attending. Thank you, Ryan, for being here and offering your wisdom. Lots of great stuff to take away from this. Thanks for all our support staff for their help. And we're going to end it right there.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/premium-trading-election-odds-historically-182726093.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IWM.US', 'NKLA.US', 'PI7.F', 'PINS.US', 'PLTR.US', 'PRI.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US', 'SVXY.US', 'TAN.US', 'TSLA.US', 'UVXY.US']","['AMAZON', 'APPLE', 'JARED BLIKRE', 'LPL FINANCIAL', 'OPTIONS MARKET', 'RYAN DETRICK']","{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.126}"
431,2020-10-08T09:53:11+00:00,TSMC Leads Chipmakers’ Sales Surge Ahead of New iPhones,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a stronger-than-expected 22% rise in quarterly sales, buoyed by orders from its largest customers including Apple Inc.The world’s largest contract chipmaker saw revenue for the three months to September climb to a record NT$356.4 billion ($12.4 billion), up from NT$293 billion a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on monthly sales data disclosed by TSMC. Fellow Taiwanese chipmakers United Microelectronics Corp. and MediaTek Inc. on Thursday also reported strong sales, suggesting a broad recovery in the industry.

TSMC in July raised its 2020 outlook, saying that revenue this year will grow by more than 20% in dollar terms. Sales for the first nine months of the year suggests that Apple’s main iPhone chipmaker is on track to meet its growth forecast as the Covid-19 pandemic fueled demand for home computing equipment.

The company’s business typically revs up in the months before Apple unveils new iPhones and the holiday season. It also likely received a boost during the quarter as its second-largest customer Huawei Technologies Co. raced to stockpile supplies before a U.S. ban on shipments to the Chinese telecom giant came into effect last month. Rival chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. reported on Thursday earnings that beat analyst estimates after its mobile and chip businesses benefited from the curbs on Huawei.

“The demand strength will sustain and see an upside risk to TSMC’s 4Q20 revenue guidance to be announced next week,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “The ramp of iPhone is delayed but just makes 4Q20 sequentially stronger. Apple silicon is ramping and will fuel the momentum in 4Q20 too. More recently, Huawei’s competitors are aggressive in placing orders, all vying to gain the share left by Huawei.”

Monthly figures released Thursday showed UMC’s third-quarter revenue was NT$44.9 billion, roughly in line with the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. MediaTek, which also counts Huawei as one of its largest customers, reported monthly revenue jumped 61%, helping to lift third-quarter sales to NT$97.3 billion. That exceeded the NT$86.3 billion forecast by analysts.

Story continues

TSMC gained 2.3% on Thursday in Taipei and closed just shy of its all-time high reached on Sept. 16. The shares have surged nearly 83% from their March lows amid signs that the company is bouncing back from the worst of the coronavirus-induced disruptions. MediaTek shares gained 3.6% while those of UMC, which have nearly doubled this year, surged more than 9% before the release of the sales numbers.

About two-thirds of TSMC’s 5-nanometer capacity has been taken up by Apple’s newest A14 processors in the run-up to the release of the new iPhones, Taipei-based Economic Daily News reported this week, citing unidentified industry sources. The handsets are expected to be unveiled next week.

The Taiwanese chipmaker is scheduled to hold its third-quarter earnings conference on Oct. 15.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s 3Q sales of NT$356 billion, despite a strengthening New Taiwan dollar, is 5% above company guidance. This may be driven by stronger-than-expected 5-nanometer A14 chipset orders from Apple and mature-node chips, in addition to rush orders from Huawei. It also implies that TSMC’s 3Q operating profit may beat consensus by more than 11%, by our calculations, assuming an operating margin of 41%.

433,2020-10-07T17:43:20+00:00,Biden Win Could Have Implications For Exciting Tech ETF,"There are myriad potential sector-level outcomes that could result following Election Day. Broadly speaking, it's expected that a victory by former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joe Biden would be beneficial to some already high-flying sectors, including technology.

What Happened

That's relevant for multiple reasons, not the least of which is the fact that technology is the largest sector weight in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. However, there are other implications for exchange traded funds, including the geared Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL).

TECL looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, a benchmark heavy on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).

Why It's Important: Obviously, TECL is a geared ETF, a triple-leveraged one at that, meaning there's substantial risk in holding the fund from now through Election Day. However, electoral outcomes are among the events that increase the allure of leveraged ETFs as short-term trading instruments, meaning TECL could be worth a look immediately following Election Day.

“Joe Biden has vowed to get tough on big tech and tax breaks should he win the U.S. presidential race in November, but analysts and legal experts note current global uncertainties could hinder the Democratic challenger from shaking up Silicon Valley in the near term,” according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

That's good news because some Biden chatter, if it evolved beyond that point, could TECL's bearish cousin, the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS), in play.

“Biden has pledged to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, undoing some of the tax cuts implemented under the Trump administration,” according to S&P Global. “The former vice president also aims to set a minimum tax of 15% on companies' book income, or profits reported to shareholders, and to raise taxes on foreign earnings of U.S. companies located overseas — two policies that directly impact the U.S tech sector.”

Story continues

What's Next

What could make TECL a valid post-election trade is if Congress remains split and more details emerge from Biden, assuming he wins, on his tax plan.

“It is unclear how much Biden's proposed increase will impact tech firms, as the tech sector is notorious for having an effective tax rate that is significantly lower than the statutory rate, or the percentage set by federal law,” notes S&P Global. “Companies report their effective tax rate as a calculated figure that includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes, as well as various tax breaks.”

Apple’s primary suppliers -- Foxconn Technology Group, Wistron Corp., Pegatron Corp. -- and Samsung Electronics Co. were among a list of global firms that were cleared by India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, according to statement on Tuesday. About 60% of the total production, or 6.5 trillion rupees, is expected to be exported in the next five years, it said.

India is attempting to lure the world’s biggest smartphone brands to make their products locally for global export with its Production Linked Incentive program, which signposts plans to increase manufacturing inducements each year. Following clashes with China along its disputed Himalayan border earlier this year, New Delhi is seeking to woo companies looking to diversify their manufacturing bases away from China, as a growing global trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic have focused minds on the risks to supply chains.

Local manufacturers Lava, Padget Electronics Pvt., UTL Neolyncs and Optiemus Electronics Ltd. were also approved under the plan.

440,2020-09-29T02:27:06+00:00,Docomo Buyout Shows Dumb Pipes No Longer Cut It,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.’s plan to buy out its NTT Docomo Inc. wireless unit would mark the end of an era for a company once hailed as the world’s leading mobile operator. It also signals a stark new reality in the telco business: that mere connectivity isn’t enough.

Docomo said its board will meet Tuesday to consider NTT’s proposal. That seems moot: The parent already owns 66% of the subsidiary. It’s likely to offer 30% more than the share price at yesterday’s close, the Nikkei newspaper reported earlier. That would be at the upper end of average premiums globally for telco deals valued at more than $5 billion in the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, it’s worth noting that prior to the news Docomo had fallen 20% below its March high and is well below its 50-, 90- and 200-day averages.

This month’s appointment of Yoshihide Suga as Japanese prime minister to succeed Shinzo Abe may have been a spur. Suga had been an outspoken critic of mobile data pricing before taking over the top job, and now forcing down tariffs has become an easy policy win. Going private would take Docomo out of the public spotlight as it renovates its business model and weathers that storm.

Docomo’s struggle was apparent even before Suga rose to the top. More than two decades ago, it amazed the world with the release of i-Mode, a mobile internet service that allowed Japanese consumers to read email and surf the web during their morning commute. Apple Inc.’s first iPhone wouldn’t arrive for another eight years.

I-Mode helped Docomo post annual revenue growth reaching as much as 26% and operating income gains of 42%, cementing its place as Japan’s No. 1 wireless carrier. While the company has held onto that position, it has done so by cutting average revenue per user below levels at KDDI Corp. or Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Corp., the first telco in Japan to sell the iPhone.

Price wars with those rivals have hurt, even amid accusations that rates remain too high by global comparison. Docomo has maintained a respectable operating margin of around 20% in recent years (it dropped to 18.4% for the year to March 30 amid the Covid pandemic). Revenue and operating income growth have slowed to a crawl, though, lagging behind competitors.

Story continues

The reasons can be seen in its sales breakdown, with 80% still coming from mobile services. By comparison, SoftBank owns Yahoo Japan (via a subsidiary) and gets additional revenue from fixed-line businesses. Consumer and enterprise wireless service accounts for only about half of SoftBank’s sales. KDDI isn’t quite as diversified, yet it’s able to lean a little more on non-telecom businesses and is pushing its so-called “life design” services that include e-commerce, personal finance, entertainment and education.

Then there’s Rakuten Inc., which recently entered the mobile business and promises to drive prices down even further. It’s doubtful whether the e-commerce company intends to make much profit from its wireless unit, instead using it as a loss-leader to drive online retail and related services.

That leaves Docomo looking pedestrian as a purveyor of mobile connectivity, aka dumb pipes, like the former state-owned incumbent that it is. With the onerous costs of a 5G rollout looming and a price war set to escalate, the safest place may be back under the protection of its majority owner. Investors need not worry about NTT having to shield its subsidiary from public markets. A combined entity could leverage procurement, better integrate infrastructure and services, and streamline its balance sheet.

Once the business is stabilized and profit growth returns, look for NTT to be the biggest winner from a future Docomo initial public offering.

442,2020-09-28T11:56:32+00:00,Three top Apple suppliers to commit $900 million to India smartphone incentive plan: sources,"By Sankalp Phartiyal

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three of Apple Inc's top contract manufacturers plan to invest a total of almost $900 million in India in the next five years to tap into a new production-linked incentive plan, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron all plan to make investments under the scheme, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.

India's new $6.65 billion production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme offers companies cash incentives on any increase in sales of locally-made smartphones over the next five years, compared with 2019-20 levels. The scheme aims to help transform India into an export manufacturing hub.

Foxconn has applied to invest about 40 billion rupees ($542 million), while Wistron and Pegatron have committed to invest close to 13 billion rupees and 12 billion rupees, respectively, under the PLI plan, the sources said.

It is unclear whether all of the investment will be targeted at boosting manufacturing of Apple devices in India, but the sources and industry insiders said the vast majority would be focused on expanding iPhone manufacturing in the country.

Foxconn said that as a matter of policy it did not comment on specific operations or work for any customer. Apple, Wistron, Pegatron and India's technology ministry, which formulated the PLI scheme, did not respond to emails seeking comment.

While Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron make devices for companies other than Apple globally, Wistron's arm in India currently assembles only iPhones.

Wistron, which assembles roughly 200,000 second-generation iPhone SEs per month in India, plans to scale that up to 400,000 a month by the end of the year, one of the sources said, as it looks to cater to export demand for the device.

That plan is expected to create roughly 10,000 jobs, the source added.

Pegatron is yet to start Indian operations, but has been in talks with several states, with Tamil Nadu in the south emerging as a frontrunner for a planned plant to manufacture Apple devices, a third source said.

Story continues

Foxconn, which also assembles devices for Xiaomi in India, already has enough capacity to meet Xiaomi's needs and is likely to use the PLI plan largely to boost iPhone production, a fourth source said.

The commitments would help Apple diversify its supply chain beyond China, which is locked in a trade war with the United States.

Apple started assembling in 2017 a low-cost iPhone model in India through Wistron's local unit in the tech hub of Bengaluru. It later ramped up production, with Foxconn beginning to assemble iPhones last year and Wistron widening operations.

""India is key to Apple's global ambitions as it expands beyond China,"" said Tarun Pathak, an associate director at tech researcher Counterpoint. ""It offers a strategic market to them where skilled labour is cheaper as compared to other manufacturing destinations, the size of the internal market is huge and the export potential is enormous.""

Local manufacturing helps Apple save costly duties levied on imports of fully-built phones and components in India, where the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant accounts for just 1% of smartphone shipments.

Apple is looking to change that. It launched its online store in India last week, and is building its first company-run retail store in the financial hub of Mumbai.

445,2020-09-24T08:02:46+00:00,'We're a tech company': Russia's Sberbank bets big on strategy shift,"By Alexander Marrow

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank, Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.

The company, which is dropping the word ""bank"" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.

Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching ""SmartMarket"", an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play.

""It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,"" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.

The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.

In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the ""largest transformation"" in its history.

""We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,"" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.

Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.

NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE

Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.

Story continues

Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon's Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps.

What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are ""cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,"" Sberbank said.

The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.

""It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,"" said Rafalovsky.

TECH'S A RISKY BUSINESS

The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.

Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.

Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft's LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.

However Sberbank's costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.

Apple, Samsung and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru, internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market.

In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia's answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.

LIFE BEYOND BANKING

While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.

BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.

Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.

""How do you earn money if you do banking business only?"" she added.

Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru, internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market.

In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia's answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.

LIFE BEYOND BANKING

While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.

BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.

Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.

""How do you earn money if you do banking business only?"" she added.

MOSCOW, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Sberbank, Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.

The company, which is dropping the word ""bank"" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.

Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching ""SmartMarket"", an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play.

""It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,"" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.

The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.

In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the ""largest transformation"" in its history.

""We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,"" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.

Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.

NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE

Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.

Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon's Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps.

What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are ""cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,"" Sberbank said.

The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.

""It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,"" said Rafalovsky.

TECH'S A RISKY BUSINESS

The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.

Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.

Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft's LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.

Pegatron, which is a manufacturing partner of Apple <AAPL.O>, Microsoft <MSFT.O> and Sony <6758.T>, had received licenses to initially invest $19 million in the city of Haiphong, the Hanoitimes and Tuoi Tre newspapers reported, citing a report by the Ministry of Planning and Investment.

Pegatron was also seeking licences for a $481-million second phase and $500 million in 2026-2027, the papers said, adding these were expected to create 22,500 jobs and contribute around 100 billion dong ($4.31 million) to the state budget per year.

Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the report and calls to the ministry were not answered.

Pegatron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Under the plans, Pegatron would join Apple's two other iPhone assemblers, Wistron Corp <3231.TW> and Foxconn <2317.TW>, in developing more capacity in Vietnam.

Apple has been producing its wireless earbuds AirPods Pro in Vietnam since May.

Su Chih-Yen, acting director of the Investment Commission of Taiwan's Economics Ministry, told Reuters it had not yet approved such an investment, but declined to comment on whether they had received an application.

In a bid to skirt U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, Taiwanese companies have been particularly active in either moving production back home or elsewhere in Asia.

Another Taiwanese company, Universal Global Technology, which produces smartphone and earbuds parts for Lenovo <0992.HK> and Sony, was also looking to set up a plant in Vietnam, Hanoitimes cited the report as saying.

ASE Technology Holding, parent company of Universal Global Technology, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Tonal — a digitally connected strength machine that is seen by many as Peloton’s main rival — announced Thursday a fresh $110 million capital infusion from a range of investors — both new and old. Some of Tonal’s newest backers are a who’s who of the sports world: Stephen Curry (NBA), Paul George (NBA), Bobby Wagner (NFL) and Michelle Wie (golf).

These sports stars join several other prominent sports names invested in Tonal, including Serena Williams (tennis), Klay Thompson (NBA) and Tony Gonzalez. As for more traditional investors, L Catterton (a main player in the digital fitness space and early Peloton backer) and the Amazon Alexa Fund have returned with fresh checks for Tonal.

The size of the investments by Curry, L Catterton, etc. were not disclosed. Nor was Tonal’s valuation following its latest capital infusion. The San Francisco-based fitness company has now raised nearly $200 million since it was founded by tech executive and current CEO Aly Orady in 2015.

Orady told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade institutional investors continue to back the company on the view the shift to working out at home is permanent.

Tonal says sales are up “12x” in 2020 versus a year ago.

The capital raise arrives amid an ambush of bullish news in the space of late. Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry invested in Tonal, a digital strength training startup. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)

Peloton’s stock is hovering near record highs (and a $24 billion market cap about one year post IPO) after a blowout second quarter last week. The connected bike and treadmill seller’s founder John Foley is now laser focused on reaching 100 million users over the next 15 years (currently has 3.1 million).

“We call it a BHAG here — a big, hairy, audacious goal — of having 100 million members and a net promoter score of 100. To our knowledge, there's not a company in the world that has 100 net promoter score, and certainly 100 million subscribers gets us in that rarefied air of some of the FAANG [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google] stocks. We think that Peloton has the opportunity to be one of those special companies, and we have thousands of people at Peloton who are marching in that direction every day and it doesn't look like we're slowing down anytime soon,” Foley told Yahoo Finance.

Story continues

Foley is less sure if Peloton will play the role of industry consolidator even as it sits on some $1.8 billion in cash.

“The challenge is that there's not that many awesome innovative technology companies in the fitness category or around the fitness category,” Foley added on the M&A topic.

But Lululemon (and Tonal) would probably disagree with Foley.

In late June, the yoga apparel maker plunked down top dollar — $500 million to be exact — to purchase Mirror. Lululemon plans to soon begin selling Mirror machines in its stores as one way to extract value from its deal.

* Musk has hinted at significant new battery developments

* Partners and acquisitions have helped give Tesla an edge (Updates sourcing for paragraph 35)

By Paul Lienert, Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is hailed as an innovator and disruptor who went from knowing next to nothing about building cars to running the world's most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years.

But his record shows he is more of a fast learner who forged alliances with firms that had technology Tesla lacked, hired some of their most talented people, and then powered through the boundaries that limited more risk-averse partners.

Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla's drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its ""Battery Day"" event on Sept. 22.

Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.

New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan's Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.

""Elon doesn't want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,"" said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. ""And for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.""

Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea's LG Chem and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.

But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs — at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.

Story continues

""There has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,"" Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.

""Our relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There's no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.""

Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

MAKE EVERYTHING

Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk's goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla's control, people familiar with Tesla's strategy said.

They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co's iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.

""Elon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,"" said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. ""He wanted to make everything.""

Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.

""Tell him 'No', and then he really wants to do it,"" said a third former Tesla veteran.

The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.

Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.

'STRAIGHT FOR MARS'

Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada ""Gigafactory"", while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla's Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.

Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.

But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn't happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.

Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.

The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.

During its development alliance with Germany's Daimler , which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.

Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.

""He learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,"" said a senior Daimler engineer said.

Meanwhile, an association with Japan's Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.

Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.

THE MUSK SPIN

Some relationships did not end well, however.

Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla's Autopilot.

""Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,"" said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.

Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.

But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.

At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla's Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.

The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.

U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.

""Nvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,"" said Nvidia's senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.

In addition to partnerships, Musk went on an acquisition spree four years ago, buying a handful of little-known companies - Grohmann, Perbix, Riviera, Compass, Hibar Systems - to rapidly advance Tesla's expertise in automation. Maxwell and SilLion further boosted Tesla's ability in battery technology.

""He learned a lot from those people,"" said Mark Ellis, a senior consultant at Munro & Associates, which has studied Tesla extensively. ""He leveraged a lot of information from them, then put his spin on making it better.""

Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla's drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its ""Battery Day"" event on Sept. 22.

Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.

New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan's Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.

""Elon doesn't want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,"" said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. ""And for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.""

Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea's LG Chem and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.

But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs — at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.

""There has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,"" Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.

""Our relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There's no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.""

Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

MAKE EVERYTHING

Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk's goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla's control, people familiar with Tesla's strategy said.

They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co's iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.

""Elon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,"" said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. ""He wanted to make everything.""

Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.

""Tell him 'No', and then he really wants to do it,"" said a third former Tesla veteran.

The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.

Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.

'STRAIGHT FOR MARS'

Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada ""Gigafactory"", while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla's Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.

Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.

But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn't happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.

Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.

The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.

During its development alliance with Germany's Daimler , which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.

Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.

""He learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,"" said a senior Daimler engineer said.

Meanwhile, an association with Japan's Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.

Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.

THE MUSK SPIN

Some relationships did not end well, however.

Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla's Autopilot.

""Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,"" said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.

Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.

But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.

At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla's Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.

The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.

U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.

""Nvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,"" said Nvidia's senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.

In addition to partnerships, Musk went on an acquisition spree four years ago, buying a handful of little-known companies - Grohmann, Perbix, Riviera, Compass, Hibar Systems - to rapidly advance Tesla's expertise in automation. Maxwell and SilLion further boosted Tesla's ability in battery technology.

""He learned a lot from those people,"" said Mark Ellis, a senior consultant at Munro & Associates, which has studied Tesla extensively. ""He leveraged a lot of information from them, then put his spin on making it better.""

NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Equity markets rose and the dollar firmed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, as expected, and said it would continue its bond-buying program to stimulate the U.S. economy as part of a dovish policy stance.

Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose and gold prices edged higher after the Fed promised to keep rates on hold until inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the U.S. central bank's 2% inflation target ""for some time.""

""They want to be dovish. They want to be super dovish. The market is priced for dovish,"" said Nancy Davis, managing partner and chief investment officer at Quadratic Capital Management LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.

""Nobody thinks there's going to be any kind of inflation at all and the guidance is more dovish and in line with what the market expected,"" Davis said, adding that she believes there is a danger inflation could exceed expectations.

New economic projections released with the Fed's policy statement showed rates on hold through at least 2023, with inflation never breaching 2% over that time. Policymakers saw the economy shrinking 3.7% this year, far less steep than the 6.5% decline forecast in June. Unemployment, which registered 8.4% in August, was seen falling to 7.6% by the end of the year.

At the Fed's last meeting in August the U.S. central bank adopted a new approach to inflation and unemployment that will allow the economy to run a little hotter than in the past to help ensure jobs growth for lower income earners.

MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets rose 0.25% to 577.1, while its emerging markets index rose 0.48%.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.72% and the S&P 500 gained 0.20%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.45%, pulled lower by declines in Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp - stocks that have propelled the index to record highs this year.

In Europe, the broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.49% at 1,446.16. London's FTSE 100 lagged gains by other European indices, down 0.44% at the close, but the struggling pound was propped up by a weaker dollar.

European retail stocks surged on strong results from Zara-owner Inditex after it said there was a progressive return to normality, with online sales growing sharply and store sales recovering. Shares of the Spanish retailer jumped 8.1%.

U.S. consumer spending slowed in August, with retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services sliding 0.1% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in July.

Retail sales lost a little steam in August, but consumers overall are still doing well despite modest weakness relative to expectations, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial at Troy, Michigan.

When the pandemic slowed economic growth, consumers were in a relatively strong financial condition, the direct opposite of what is normally the case for an economic downturn, he said.

""Consumers are still overall doing well despite the modest weakness relative to expectations,"" Price said.

456,2020-09-15T16:24:21+00:00,Reasons To Believe In A Tempting Tech ETF,"The darling technology sector took some lumps earlier this month, but consensus wisdom appears to be that was a mere blip and the group will get its groove back if it's not already doing so.

What Happened

Of course, that would be beneficial to the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL), which is one of the premier leveraged plays on the largest sector in the S&P 500.

TECL tries to deliver triple the daily performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, essentially making the Direxion exchange traded fund a geared play on Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) because those stocks combine for over 44% of the Technology Select Sector Index.

Why It's Important

When the technology sector hits bumps in the road, inevitably, there are calls that the 2000 tech wreck is going to repeat. Should that happen, TECL, predictably, would be a disastrous ETF to be holding. Fortunately, a 2000 sequel isn't brewing.

“When we compare the most recent run-up in IT to its counterpart from 20 years ago, we observe that the current relative outperformance of the sector is much less extreme than during the late 1990s,” notes S&P Dow Jones Indices. “Moreover, the relative volatility of the IT sector was much higher then (December 1996-December 2000) than it is now, with an annualized standard deviation of daily relative returns of 23%—almost two and a half times the current period’s standard deviation of 9.5% (December 2016-August 2020).”

The 2000 bursting of the tech bubble washed out an array of flimsy companies. However, it's not a stretch to say that while the sector won't move up in a straight line, components in TECL's underlying index are far stronger today than they were two decades ago.

What's Next

There is, of course, something to that strength, which is derived in large part from significant economic moats and fortress-like balance sheets. Additionally, that strength can augur well for reduced volatility with TECL.

Story continues

“In 1999 and the present, IT had a strong tilt toward momentum and high beta and a tilt away from value,” according to S&P Dow Jones. “However, one of the main differences between now and then is that IT currently has much stronger tilts toward quality and low volatility than it did in 1999. This suggests that the companies within the current IT sector are both more profitable and less volatile now than they were 20 years ago.”

457,2020-09-14T11:12:18+00:00,iPhone Makers Among Winners in $6.6 Billion India Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s major iPhone assemblers are among the companies expected to win approval to participate in a $6.6 billion stimulus program to bring manufacturing to India, according to people familiar with the matter, a potentially seismic shift as the world’s most valuable company diversifies beyond China.

At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the Indian government is expected to approve a plan aimed at bringing $150 billion in mobile-phone production over the next five years, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Among the dozen phonemakers already cleared by a high-powered government committee are Apple’s primary supplier Foxconn Technology Group, which had submitted two applications, and peers Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp., the people said. The three companies make virtually every iPhone sold globally in sprawling factories currently located mainly in China.

Under the Production Linked Incentive program, or PLI as it’s called, manufacturing incentives will rise each year in an ongoing effort to entice the world’s biggest smartphone brands to make their products in India and export to the world. Besides the Apple contractors, Samsung Electronics Co. is the only other applicant for the five slots allotted to foreign companies. China’s largest phonemakers Huawei Technologies Co. and BBK Group, which manufactures brands like Oppo and Vivo, are conspicuous by their absence.

Amid rising trade and political tensions between the U.S. and China, India is betting that many global brands will be keen to reduce their dependence on China. If successful, the program could set in motion a shift in electronics manufacturing in the next five years.“It’s a thoughtful move by the government aimed at wooing Apple to bring significant iPhone manufacturing to India because, when the iPhone maker shifts, an entire ecosystem follows,” said Hari Om Rai, chairman and founder of Lava International Ltd., India’s largest homegrown phonemaker. “The next five years will be dramatic, and India could become the new China in phone manufacturing.”

It could also funnel much-needed aid to local brands that have rapidly ceded market share to Chinese brands. Lava, based in the New Delhi suburbs, is among the Indian phonemakers applying for manufacturing incentives, along with Karbonn Mobiles and Dixon Technologies India Ltd. Dixon climbed 6.3% to 9,822.90 rupees at the close on Monday, its highest on record.

“Chinese brands have driven out domestic phone companies, leaving them with a mere 2% market share,” said Faisal Kawoosa, chief analyst at Gurgaon-based researcher techARC Pvt. “PLI will boost domestic phonemakers, help them get back to scale and profitability by selling not just in India, but exporting to foreign markets too.”

To receive the incentives, foreign manufacturers including Foxconn, Wistron and Samsung must commit to specific investment and production targets of devices that sell for at least 15,000 rupees ($200); Indian phonemakers will have no such restrictions. Last month, Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s minister for electronics and information technology, told reporters that Apple accounts for 37% and Samsung 22% of global sales revenue share from mobile phones. The incentive scheme would “increase their manufacturing base manifold in the country,” the ministry said in a statement.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Pegatron, the second-largest iPhone assembler after Foxconn with a number of factories in China, said in July that it would set up a plant in India. Apple accounts for more than half of Pegatron’s business. If approved, Pegatron’s first India factory would be eligible for PLI, the people said.

In the next five years, India could attract an additional 10% of global handset production, Credit Suisse said in a recent note. And though the country is the world’s second-largest handset market with plenty of room for domestic sales growth, the government’s clear aim is to eventually become a global manufacturing colossus to rival China. Almost two-thirds of the stimulus program is targeted at the export market, the people said.

Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of India Cellular and Electronics Association, a trade group that represents leading phonemakers including Apple, Oppo and Xiaomi, said incoming handset makers will be accompanied by a host of smaller sub-assemblers and component makers, expanding the sector to seven times its current size in the next five or so years.“India’s incentive scheme will be a game-changer that will make the country No. 1 in mobile manufacturing, or at least a close No. 2 by 2025,” Mohindroo said.

459,2020-09-14T01:00:00+00:00,RPT-COLUMN-Aluminium producers' race to go green may fracture market: Andy Home,"(Repeats Sept 11 column, no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)

* Global aluminium production by energy source: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Fbh0lK

By Andy Home

LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Tesla is ordering giant aluminium casting presses for its assembly line in Germany.

The ""Gigapress"" is the size of a small house and will replace with a single module around 70 parts that are currently glued and riveted into the car's chassis.

Aluminium is one of the materials of choice for the electric vehicle pioneer because of its light weight and strength, which mean extra mileage and enhanced safety.

Indeed, aluminium is going to be one of the metals critical to the unfolding green revolution, not just for its role in transport but also for its use in renewable energy sources, particularly solar panels.

The problem is that making aluminium can be a carbon-intensive business. The sector accounts for almost 3% of global emissions.

The race to produce low carbon aluminium is now on as producers look to differentiate their product in a shifting consumer landscape.

But this widening rift between ""green"" and ""black"" aluminium risks fracturing the market's current pricing model because a ""green premium"" is not only coming much faster than many industry players think, it may already be here.

THE ROCKY ROAD TO ZERO

Aluminium smelting is an energy-intensive business, each producer's carbon footprint is primarily determined by which power source it is using. Hydro scores low. Coal scores high. Gas is somewhere in the middle.

The average comes in at around 10 tonnes of carbon per tonne of aluminium produced but the global range can be anything from 4 to 18 tonnes, according to Antti Koulumies, Vice President for the aluminium line of equipment supplier Metso Outotec .

The sector's energy efficiency has deteriorated this century as ever more of the world's aluminium production has migrated to China, where coal is the predominant power source, Koulumies said.

Story continues

He was speaking at this week's CRU World Aluminium (Virtual) Conference, where producers lined up in something of a low carbon beauty parade.

Alvance, the aluminium business of British commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, is rapidly growing via the acquisition of low-carbon smelters such as Lochaber in Scotland (hydro) and Dunkerque in France (nuclear). It's on the lookout for more.

India's Hindalco starts from the disadvantage of being coal-dependent but is building supplementary solar supply at its smelters with a target of 100 megawatts by March 2021, according to managing director Satish Pai. It's a relatively low-cost way of reducing the carbon count per tonne of metal.

Hongqiao, one of the world's largest producers, has gone for the very Chinese solution of dismantling two million tonnes of capacity in Shandong province (coal) and building a new smelter and ""green"" aluminium hub in hydropower-rich Yunnan.

The move will be completed in super-fast time by the end of Q1 2021, according to Ron Knapp, previously head of the International Aluminium Institute and now special adviser to Hongqiao's chairman.

The industry's ultimate goal is carbon neutrality by 2050, a target that may require redefining the Hall-Heroult smelting process itself.

ELYSIS, a joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa is already there, using a process that eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from smelting. Apple, a partner in the project, has already made its first purchase, according to Tolga Egrilmezer, head of Rio's aluminium marketing division.

However, many producers, particularly those in China, are going to find the road to zero emissions a long and winding one, if not impossible.

The emerging split between ""green"" and ""black"" aluminium is only going to widen.

SPLITTING THE MARKET

Despite the rush by (mainly hydro) producers to differentiate their product, a ""green premium"" has so far proved elusive.

That's partly down to a lack of agreement about how exactly to calculate ""green"" metal. Low-carbon producers are mutually wary of each others' methodologies.

More fundamentally, there is not yet sufficient demand to generate a physical premium.

Western consumer brands such as Apple and Tesla are relatively well-supplied with low carbon aluminium from Canadian and European smelters.

Left to market forces, it's uncertain how long it would take for demand to grow to the point that buyers need to pay a physical premium to secure supply.

However, it won't be left to market forces.

""Astute and forward-looking policy makers are considering shifts to government procurement practices in order to value low CO2 materials (and) green borders,"" Jean Simard said. Simard is head of the Aluminium Association of Canada, which gives some clue as to which policy makers he may have in mind.

But it is the European Union which is leading the way both by accelerating its carbon reduction strategy and looking at ways of penalising imports of high carbon products as a way of preventing ""carbon leakage"".

SPLITTING THE PRICE

While a ""green premium"" may not yet have traded in the physical aluminium market, it is starting to take shape in the financial market, which is anticipating the forward curve both of carbon regulation and consumer demand.

Trade house Trafigura has just announced a low carbon aluminium financing facility of up to $500 million with the backing of Natixis and Rabobank. Interest will be ""at a preferential"" rate, which allows Trafigura to pay low carbon producers a premium for their product.

The facility will likely also be used to finance inventory. Aluminium is a metal that has historically carried high stocks, which are financed via the London Metal Exchange (LME) forward curve.

Such deals can last just a few months or they can be structured over years, in which case financiers are now facing a dilemma.

""Trading houses, which are running the bulk of cash-and-carry deals, are conscious that high-carbon products may trade at a discount to their low-carbon peers when these deals are unwound in 1-2 years,"" explain analysts at Citi. (""Metals Weekly"", Sept. 8, 2020).

As carbon rapidly moves up institutional investors' agenda, ""Western banks may, over time, become more constrained in financing high-carbon materials"", according to Citi.

* Global aluminium production by energy source: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Fbh0lK

By Andy Home

LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Tesla is ordering giant aluminium casting presses for its assembly line in Germany.

The ""Gigapress"" is the size of a small house and will replace with a single module around 70 parts that are currently glued and riveted into the car's chassis.

Aluminium is one of the materials of choice for the electric vehicle pioneer because of its light weight and strength, which mean extra mileage and enhanced safety.

Indeed, aluminium is going to be one of the metals critical to the unfolding green revolution, not just for its role in transport but also for its use in renewable energy sources, particularly solar panels.

The problem is that making aluminium can be a carbon-intensive business. The sector accounts for almost 3% of global emissions.

The race to produce low carbon aluminium is now on as producers look to differentiate their product in a shifting consumer landscape.

But this widening rift between ""green"" and ""black"" aluminium risks fracturing the market's current pricing model because a ""green premium"" is not only coming much faster than many industry players think, it may already be here.

THE ROCKY ROAD TO ZERO

Aluminium smelting is an energy-intensive business, each producer's carbon footprint is primarily determined by which power source it is using. Hydro scores low. Coal scores high. Gas is somewhere in the middle.

The average comes in at around 10 tonnes of carbon per tonne of aluminium produced but the global range can be anything from 4 to 18 tonnes, according to Antti Koulumies, Vice President for the aluminium line of equipment supplier Metso Outotec .

The sector's energy efficiency has deteriorated this century as ever more of the world's aluminium production has migrated to China, where coal is the predominant power source, Koulumies said.

Story continues

He was speaking at this week's CRU World Aluminium (Virtual) Conference, where producers lined up in something of a low carbon beauty parade.

Alvance, the aluminium business of British commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, is rapidly growing via the acquisition of low-carbon smelters such as Lochaber in Scotland (hydro) and Dunkerque in France (nuclear). It's on the lookout for more.

India's Hindalco starts from the disadvantage of being coal-dependent but is building supplementary solar supply at its smelters with a target of 100 megawatts by March 2021, according to managing director Satish Pai. It's a relatively low-cost way of reducing the carbon count per tonne of metal.

Hongqiao, one of the world's largest producers, has gone for the very Chinese solution of dismantling two million tonnes of capacity in Shandong province (coal) and building a new smelter and ""green"" aluminium hub in hydropower-rich Yunnan.

The move will be completed in super-fast time by the end of Q1 2021, according to Ron Knapp, previously head of the International Aluminium Institute and now special adviser to Hongqiao's chairman.

The industry's ultimate goal is carbon neutrality by 2050, a target that may require redefining the Hall-Heroult smelting process itself.

ELYSIS, a joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa is already there, using a process that eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from smelting. Apple, a partner in the project, has already made its first purchase, according to Tolga Egrilmezer, head of Rio's aluminium marketing division.

However, many producers, particularly those in China, are going to find the road to zero emissions a long and winding one, if not impossible.

The emerging split between ""green"" and ""black"" aluminium is only going to widen.

SPLITTING THE MARKET

Despite the rush by (mainly hydro) producers to differentiate their product, a ""green premium"" has so far proved elusive.

That's partly down to a lack of agreement about how exactly to calculate ""green"" metal. Low-carbon producers are mutually wary of each others' methodologies.

More fundamentally, there is not yet sufficient demand to generate a physical premium.

Western consumer brands such as Apple and Tesla are relatively well-supplied with low carbon aluminium from Canadian and European smelters.

Left to market forces, it's uncertain how long it would take for demand to grow to the point that buyers need to pay a physical premium to secure supply.

However, it won't be left to market forces.

""Astute and forward-looking policy makers are considering shifts to government procurement practices in order to value low CO2 materials (and) green borders,"" Jean Simard said. Simard is head of the Aluminium Association of Canada, which gives some clue as to which policy makers he may have in mind.

But it is the European Union which is leading the way both by accelerating its carbon reduction strategy and looking at ways of penalising imports of high carbon products as a way of preventing ""carbon leakage"".

SPLITTING THE PRICE

While a ""green premium"" may not yet have traded in the physical aluminium market, it is starting to take shape in the financial market, which is anticipating the forward curve both of carbon regulation and consumer demand.

Trade house Trafigura has just announced a low carbon aluminium financing facility of up to $500 million with the backing of Natixis and Rabobank. Interest will be ""at a preferential"" rate, which allows Trafigura to pay low carbon producers a premium for their product.

The facility will likely also be used to finance inventory. Aluminium is a metal that has historically carried high stocks, which are financed via the London Metal Exchange (LME) forward curve.

Such deals can last just a few months or they can be structured over years, in which case financiers are now facing a dilemma.

""Trading houses, which are running the bulk of cash-and-carry deals, are conscious that high-carbon products may trade at a discount to their low-carbon peers when these deals are unwound in 1-2 years,"" explain analysts at Citi. (""Metals Weekly"", Sept. 8, 2020).

As carbon rapidly moves up institutional investors' agenda, ""Western banks may, over time, become more constrained in financing high-carbon materials"", according to Citi.

That differential in stocks financing requirements will be tradeable on the spot platform the LME is launching next year. The initiative complements a move towards voluntary reporting of a metal's environmental foot-print.

463,2020-09-10T12:43:57+00:00,Tech Tumble Didn't Chase Traders From Geared Sector ETF,"It would be reasonable to expect that last week's breathtaking declines among marquee technology stocks and the Nasdaq-100 Index would be all the impetus traders need to abandon leveraged tech exchange-traded funds, at least for the moment.

What Happened

With the likes of Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) punished last week, the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL) felt plenty of pain, too.

TECL looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, making it an easy target for downside when Apple and friends retreat.

Why It's Important

“I think we should start to anticipate a rotation—the momentum behind tech is going to ease,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told the Wall Street Journal. “As we’re seeing easing lockdowns and the prospect of a vaccine, people are beginning to go back to a more normal way of life, and reliance on tech is starting to fade from the peak where it was at the height of the lockdown.”

That may be the case over the near-term, but data suggest traders didn't go running for the hills with TECL amid the tech pullback. They did the opposite. Month-to-date, inflows to the leverage tech ETF are approaching $42 million.

That's not a massive sum, but it says traders are convinced tech's early September retreat is a bump in the road, not cause for ongoing concern.

TECL could be starting to get its groove back. Yes, the geared fund is lower by a staggering 23.17% over the past week, but it surged 9.28% on Wednesday on volume that was roughly 60% above the daily average, providing another sign traders that stick by the fund are being rewarded.

What's Next

Over the course of tech's ascent this year, retreats have been brief and rebounds rapid, scenarios that amplify the risk of holding a leveraged fund like TECL for more than a few days.

Speaking of risk, some bold traders aren't shying away from making bearish bets against the beloved tech sector. To start September, nearly $10 million has flowed into TECL's bearish cousin – the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS).

Story continues

Interestingly, traders have been tempting fate with the bearish TECS for most of this year as highlighted by 2020 inflows of almost $97 million.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: --on research at CFRA. So Todd, I want to start off about the selloff that we saw, of course, led by tech. Now in the run up, a lot of people said, well, frankly some of these tech stocks are a little too expensive, so chose instead to get some exposure via tech ETFs. Now we're seeing we had this pullback, the rotation that we're seeing in the market. Are tech ETFs a little bit too risky to hold right now?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: No. We at CFRA still think there's good value to be had. We like technology ETFs. For example, XLK is it technology select sector spider. If you're going to buy tech ETFs, you really have to like Apple and Microsoft. Those are the two heavyweights, very concentrated portfolio.

We at CFRA have a bullish recommendation still on those companies, as well as companies like Visa that are also part of the portfolio. So we still think there's a good opportunity to be invested, but with the benefits of diversification using technology-- certain technology ETFs.

KRISTIN MYERS: So to that point, because I was reading your note, you don't see tech underperforming next year. And you're actually recommending that investors overweight the sector. I'm wondering what you're seeing coming up through to the end of 2020, but even ahead in 2021, any if there is at all a concern, perhaps, of a larger pullback coming in the next couple of months.

TODD ROSENBLUTH: Well, there's always going to be pullbacks that take place that give, perhaps, buying opportunities. We at CFRA have a few overweight recommended sectors, technology being one of them, communication services. Those are the more growth-oriented sectors that we like, and health care and consumer staples that are more defensive. So we do think you want to balance your portfolio out with both cyclical, risk-on, as well as more defensive, risk-off areas.

Story continues

Where we think there's still room to be had-- Apple has been performing very well, but has some news that's likely to be coming out that could drive the company forward. We think Microsoft has been a big beneficiary of the trend towards cloud. And again, those are the two heavyweight companies.

But there's also some good opportunities further-- slightly further down the market cap spectrum and with ETFs like XLK or VGT, which is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. You get that diversification. Or you can get a little bit more targeted with some more industry or thematic-oriented ETFs.

KRISTIN MYERS: Looking through your note, I was struck by the fact that energy ETFs most popular. And given the fact that energy has been lagging the broader market, what do you think has been behind that trend?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: So bottom fishing is likely what's happening. Investors have been looking to take the value opportunities and hope that there's going to be a recovery that's faster than expected. You're right XLE, which is the energy select sector spider, year-to-date through August had more inflows than technology-oriented ETFs.

The irony is that its asset base is largely flat where it was at the beginning of the year, despite having over $3 and 1/2 billion of net inflows. So 35%, give or take, of the assets grew because the portfolio was down more than 35%. So not a good investment. It has not worked out for many people.

But it's a sign that energy, as well as utilities, which was an area that's been underperforming-- investors are becoming more tactical this year, using sector-oriented ETFs. It's typically been a part of the ETF lineup. But it's increasingly been used as investors want to be focused on certain sectors, either growth or more value-oriented defensive sectors.

KRISTIN MYERS: So quickly, before I run out of time with you, Todd, I want to ask about actively-managed ETFs. They're growing in popularity. Do you think investors are better served with active management?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: Well, we're certainly seeing more of them. So we've had new entrants, like T. Rowe Price, enter the ETF market. We've got Fidelity and American Century. If you believe in active management, and there are many people who still think you can find value in outperforming the broader market, you get the tax efficiency benefits and liquidity that you're used to with ETFs. So really excited about what's happening. We've got some other players that are lined up to come to market, like JPMorgan, with active ETFs like this, as well as Invesco.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, thank you for joining us today.

7 of the Best Penny Stocks to Buy Now

Here are 7 undervalued stocks to buy:

Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Enel Americas (NYSE:ENIA) Allstate (NYSE:ALL) Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Flowserve (NYSE:FLS)

These stocks have favorable valuations from a price-earnings (P/E) ratio measure. They trade at reasonable levels today, but have prospects that look vastly better in the future.

Carnival bottomed out back in August around the $13.00 range and has since begun forming a positive uptrend. Investors are looking beyond the coronavirus lockdown that banned Carnival from sailing as of March and instead contemplating the future.

At the time of the travel advisory, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a No Sale Order that which suggested that the cruise line could resume sailing for eight of its ships from Texas and Florida. In Europe, Carnival resumed operations this month, with initial sailings from the Italian ports on September 6. A second Carnival brand, Germany-based AIDA Cruises, starts Canary Island voyages in November.

Story continues

CCL stock still scores poorly on value, growth and quality. But that will quickly change as operations resume and revenue restarts. Investors are forward-looking and anticipate a sales recovery from 2021 onward. Carnival's seasonal strength begins now

Carnival’s seasonal strength begins now.

Data from Stock Rover Research

The seasonality bar chart above suggests that the stock will rise between August and December. If ships do depart, positive performance compared to the index will widen.

Carnival is unlikely to face weakening bookings following re-opening. Customers will take a chance in sailing, especially if the cruise line offers a big discount. Initially, lack of capacity will create a shortage of supply. So Carnival stock may respond positively to an increase in bookings.

In a 5-year discounted cash flow growth exit model, Carnival stock has a fair value of around $25. This assumes a discount rate of 9% and a perpetuity growth rate of 4%. With all of this in mind, CCL stock is one of the great undervalued stocks to buy.

ViacomCBS (VIAC) Undervalued Stocks to Buy: ViacomCBS (VIAC)

In the entertainment sector, ViacomCBS trades too low to ignore. The company holds billions in debt, but it also has no problem refinancing it. For example, on June 10, VIAC sold $1.74 billion in securities. By lowering its interest costs on debt and monetizing its intellectual property, VIAC is an undervalued stock that investors should consider.

In the second quarter, ViacomCBS posted revenue falling by 12% to $6.28 billion. Adjusted OIBDA (operating income before depreciation and amortization) rose 8% year-over-year to $1.69 billion. The pandemic also hurt advertising revenue, which fell by 27% year-over-year. Global advertising demand weakened but investors are looking to an improving future.

Offsetting VIAC’s traditional pre-Covid business is domestic streaming and digital video revenue. Streaming subscriptions and digital video advertising revenue rose 25% Y/Y. Pluto TV advertising improved in the quarter while streaming subscription revenue jumped 52% Y/Y.

If a movie like Disney‘s (NYSE:DIS) Mulan succeeds as a streaming-only release, ViacomCBS could follow suit. Conversely, as the economy re-opens, investors may expect ad revenue and theatrical revenue to recover.

On Wall Street, analysts are neutral on the upside prospects of ViacomCBS stock, with the price target at $29.53. Similarly, based on its Enterprise Value to EBITDA, Stock Rover has a fair value of $26.27.

VIAC Industry S&P 500 85 53 79 40.50% 48.60% 28.80% 17.10% 13.90% 12.50% 7.00% 7.00% 7.50% 4.50% 2.40% 6.20% 16.50% 7.20% 24.80% 12.40% 5.90% 15.30%

In the table above, VIAC trails the industry in gross margin. However, the net margin is above that of the S&P 500 average. So for these reasons, VIAC stock is another under-the-radar buy.

In the table above, VIAC trails the industry in gross margin. However, the net margin is not too far off from the S&P 500 average. So for these reasons, VIAC stock is another under-the-radar buy. Using an “EBITDA Multiples” model to compare ViacomCBS with its peers, the fair value is $36.81.

Enel Americas (ENIA) Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Enel Americas (ENIA)

Currently, Enel Americas trades at a single-digit P/E ratio with a dividend in the 12% range. But investors shouldn’t be fooled by such high yield: a dividend cancellation or reduction could easily lower that rate. But for now, Enel hasn’t indicated any impending changes.

Additionally, the utility company reported second-quarter revenue decline of 21.1% YOY to $5.7 billion. Enel also reported EBITDA falling by 28.9% mainly due to extraordinary effects incurred. For example, an agreement signed between Edesur and the Argentine State for outstanding claims cost the company $279 million last year. The coronavirus also contributed to the company’s decline, albeit to a lesser extent.

Moreover, if Enel excluded the exchange rate impact on Brazil and Peru, EBITDA would have fallen by 13.3% instead of 29.1%.  Government support will also accelerate economic recovery. Chief Executive Officer Maurizio Bezzeccheri said, “we know that for example in Brazil will be put in place a specific amount of money, almost €4 billion for the economic recovery.”

On the balance sheet, Enel’s net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 1.4. This gives the firm plenty of room to increase debt if it needs to. With record-low interest rates, refinancing should lower the cost to manage debt — another reason ENIA stock is a large-value, low-cost buy.

Allstate (ALL) Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Allstate (ALL)

Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com

At the moment, Allstate is stuck in a trading range in the $90 to $95 levels. The insurance giant is also valued at a P/E ratio in the high single digits with a market cap below $30 billion.

Last month, Allstate recorded a $334 million pre-tax income from the PG&E settlement. Thankfully, Hurricane Laura didn’t inflict as much damage as expected, minimizing additional costs Allstate may have faced.

In the second quarter, Allstate posted an adjusted net income of $2.46 a share. Revenues of $11.2 billion are due to higher realized capital gains and property-liability premium growth. Strong underwriting results lifted the insurer’s net income to $1.2 billion in the period.

Its growth plan is on track to increase its personal property-liability market share. For example, Allstate is expanding customer access by combining direct sales operations. This will strengthen the Allstate brand. Plus, better online and call center sales flow from the Allstate direct channel will improve customer service.

The Q2 launch of the new Allstate One app signals the company’s willingness to embrace technological change.

Additionally, on Stock Rover, Allstate stock has a value score of 98/100:

ALLIndustryS&P 500 Value Score 987573 Price / Earnings 7.1 20.4 35.2 Price / Sales 0.7 1 2.5 Price / Free Cash Flow 5.5 7.4 21.6 Price / Book 1.2 1.3 4

Data courtesy of Stock Rover

As shown in the table above, ALL stock has a price-to-earnings that is less than half that of the industry. It is five times below that of the S&P 500 index.

4 Travel Stocks to Buy for the Great Outdoors

Analysts are also bullish on the company, with the average price target around $119. For these reasons, ALL stock is another undervalued stock to buy for investors.

Simon Property Group (SPG) Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)

The real estate investment trust (REIT) market is still risky despite stocks rallying in this space. However, Simon Property Group is insistent on its commercial tenants paying rent. And although it won’t get all the rental income it’s owed, partial recoupment will help lift company revenue.

Moreover, on August 14, the REIT giant, along with apparel licensing firm Authentic Brands, bought Lucky Brands for $140.1 million. The deal will keep Lucky’s core stores open, and ultimately lead to continued rental income for Simon.

Still, the company needs customers willing to return to malls in high volume. And the U.S. can’t afford another spike in coronavirus cases. If a second spike should come to pass, shoppers will once more avoid crowded malls.

Overall, Simon stock trades at a low P/E multiple, and its dividend was recently resumed, as announced on June 29. If it pays at least $6.00 a share in dividends in 2020, the yield will be over 8%.

So as businesses reopen, Simon’s rental income will recover. And if the economy rebounds back to pre-Covid-19 levels, the stock will rebound back to the $100 levels in a hurry.

Wells Fargo (WFC)

Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com

Financials and energy stocks are first to falter when investors are nervous about the economy’s health. Wells Fargo fell to a low of $22 in May, and has since moved nowhere, stuck in a narrow range around $23 to $25.

That said, things could have been worse. Moody’s affirmed the company’s A2 long-term senior unsecured debt rating. The bad news here is that it changed its outlook from stable to negative. Wells Fargo quality score

As shown above, over the past seven years, Wells Fargo stock has a value score close to perfect. Growth and quality are down after provisions rose.

Collectively though, Wells Fargo is a diversified bank whose shares are trading at too big a discount to ignore. Sure, the company slashed its dividend, paying less than its peers, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Yet the dividend and share buyback reduction will let the company preserve its capital. In times of potentially growing credit losses, WFC simply needs more capital on its balance sheet.

The 3 Best Long-Term Stocks for a Clear Path to Riches

Going nowhere fast, Wells Fargo stock suits the patient investor. The business is fine and the investments in digital banking will ultimately lead to better customer service and experience. As time passes, the bad publicity over the credit card scandal will be forgotten. As management navigates through stock underperformance by reigniting the business, investors will be handsomely rewarded.

Flowserve (FLS)

Source: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com

Flowserve is building an uptrend that began in March. Since May, the stock has traded in the $29.50 range, unable to recapture the previous peak over $50. That could soon change.

The specialty industry machinery firm pays a decent dividend that yields almost 3%. In the second quarter, the company posted revenue falling just 6.6% from last year, to $924.97 million. However, adjusted earnings per share rose 152% sequentially to 53 cents (7 cents unadjusted). Although bookings fell 26.9% to $808.3 million and sales fell 6.6% Y/Y to $925 million, markets did not react negatively to the stock.

Furthermore, Flowserve reported an operating margin of 4.6% and gross margins of 28.9%. The company also reported a strong liquidity position of $1.3 billion. This includes $562 million of cash and cash equivalents and $722 million from its revolving credit facility.

Considering the high volatility in oil prices throughout Q2, Flowserve offset weak conditions with capital expenditure cuts from integrated and national oil companies. It forecast $100 million in cost reductions for 2020 and EPS of 73 cents for the first half of the year.

By Tom Arnold and Tom Westbrook

LONDON/SINGAPORE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - World shares slipped from record highs on Friday, and were on course for their worst week in more than two months, while gains in bonds and the dollar were modest as investors waited to see if U.S. jobs data triggers a bigger sell-off.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index traded flat after earlier rebounding from its worst day in more than a month a day before amid a tech-led plunge on Wall Street on Thursday.

German industrial goods orders rose by a smaller-than-expected 2.8% on the month in July, undermining hopes of recovery for Europe's largest economy from the coronavirus shock.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3% and looked set to snap a six-week winning streak with its biggest weekly loss since April. Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average closed down 1.1%.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries and had touched record highs earlier on Thursday, shed 0.2%.

""Stock market valuation is rich on a stand-alone basis, but far less extreme compared to other asset classes. Hence, it's likely a bit too soon to be calling the next bear market even though September 3 did mark the top of the equity market back in 1929,"" said Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at Robeco.

U.S. futures were mixed, recovering some ground after heavier losses earlier in the session. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4% and S&P 500 futures were 0.5% up.

The market focus is now on U.S. payrolls due at 1230 GMT, which could be a selling trigger if an expected slowdown in hiring is deeper than forecast.

""I don't think a huge number of investors will be adjusting their positions ahead of the U.S. payroll data but because of yesterday's sell-off there will be a bit more sensitivity to the data,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

""U.S. jobs data has been pretty consistently awful in a big picture sense. Fundamentally, there is nothing that can happen in payrolls that can tell you much more about the trajectory of the economy.""

Foreign exchange markets were on edge at the possibility and a safety bid helped the dollar cling to gains that have it headed for its best week in more than two months.

The euro, which has fallen from a 28-month peak above $1.20 on talk the European Central Bank is concerned about its strength, seems to have eased its slide for now, and last sat at $1.1852.

The yen was steady at 106.16 per dollar and bonds pared what was a pretty modest rise overnight, given the sell-off in the equity market.

Elsewhere, Turkey's lira weakened for a fifth straight session to a new record low as pressure rose on the central bank to tighten credit amid stubbornly high inflation.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yields rose about 3 basis points on Friday, having fallen overnight.

German yields stabilised, having fallen the day before on equity sell-offs.

TECH TUMBLE, BANKS SURGE

Thursday's tumble was the biggest one-day percentage drop on the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 since March and the darling stocks of recent months were hit hardest.

Still, the plunge in Apple, Tesla and Microsoft only wound the Nasdaq back as far as where it sat last Tuesday. It is still up 28% for the year so far and 73% higher than its March trough.

""No single factor sparked the sell-off,"" said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, citing more general worries the rally had run too far, too fast.

""However, this is unlikely to be a repeat of the tech wreck of the late 1990s, given how much the market and sector have changed,"" he added.

In Europe, technology shares fell back after limited tech selling in Asia.

The bank index helped offset tech's woes, with Spanish banks Bankia and Caixabank both marking double-digit gains earlier in the session after they said they were considering a merger to create the biggest lender in Spain. In commodity markets, oil was headed for its largest weekly drop since June amid worries about demand as the U.S. summer driving season draws to a close.

Brent crude futures were up 0.6% at $44.35 a barrel and U.S. crude was 0.8% higher at $41.69 a barrel.

Gold added 0.4% as investors sought out the safety of the precious metal ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data.

469,2020-09-04T11:40:35+00:00,"Tech Selloff Seen as Removal of Froth, Not a Warning Sign","(Bloomberg) -- The technology selloff was speculative excess coming off a hot market, rather than the beginning of a broader pullback.

That’s the consensus view of investors and strategists after Thursday’s 5.2% plunge in the Nasdaq 100 Index, the worst since March.

With the pandemic continuing to rage and a vaccine likely months away, bulls say there are plenty of good reasons why technology shares can be supported at current levels, despite lofty valuations.

Jobs and a Holiday

“Yes, today was a bad day. Ripe for profit-taking, but even with the 3% to 5% drop markets are still at impressive levels,” said Larry Peruzzi, director of international trading at Mischler Financial. The monthly jobs report -- a key data point amid Covid times -- comes out Friday morning U.S. time and that “could restart the rally” if it’s much better than expected, he said.

Volumes and engagement might be lower ahead of the Labor Day holiday in the U.S., which will keep markets closed on Monday, he noted.

The Options Are All Right

“Many market narratives have focused on the low put/call ratios on some key big-cap tech and tech index levels as a sign of complacency,” said Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC. “But while these put-call ratios reflect a bullish frenzy, Apple and Tesla being key examples, they don’t necessarily have to portend some enormous market vulnerability.”

“Under-protected trending assets can have widespread implications that can bleed over into all assets -- the financial crisis of 2008 being an extreme example of this condition,” he said. “But the data suggests that put buying has been robust, just not as robust as the call buying has been.”

Pivotal Valuation Point

Stifel Nicolaus & Co.’s head of institutional equity strategy, Barry Bannister, offers a case for further gains in valuations -- though he warned the path is fraught.

“The current market level is pivotal: the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings multiple of the S&P 500 is knocking at the doorstep of the same point at which CAPE broke out in the last two years of the most powerful bull markets of the past century, the late 1920s and late 1990s,” he said.

Story continues

“If CAPE does break out, the building (and inevitable bursting) of a bubble could make the market a ‘greater fool game’ challenge in the near-term and a modest return vehicle longer term,” he added. “The mega-bull case: Combinations of equity risk premium and 10-year TIPS produce much higher S&P 500 fair values.”

No Tech Wreck

“When it comes to the tech sector and the other online giants that have gained so much in the last few months, there could be profit taking as we head toward the U.S. presidential election in November,” said JPMorgan Asset Management strategist Kerry Craig. “Negative headlines on potential regulatory and tax changes are likely to add to investor unease in a market with elevated valuations.”

“However, this is unlikely to be a repeat of the tech wreck of the late 1990s, given how much the market and sector have changed,” he added.

“While tech sector valuations are elevated, we are also mindful of the earnings and revenue potential in the coming years from areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, as well as how many of these companies will benefit from the shifts in corporate attitudes toward physical workplaces,” he said.

Still, other strategists pointed to areas that continued to concern them.

Vaccine Downside

“If more positive announcements regarding a viable and effective vaccine are forthcoming, as expected, selling in technology could continue as funds raised will be allocated across the sectors most closely associated with the other side of the pandemic,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc.

Volatility Key

Rising volatility and correlation could trip markets, according to Olivier D’Assier, head of applied research for Asia-Pacific at Qontigo GmbH.

“There is a lot of short-term liquidity in the market now because of all the quantitative easing programs, but this liquidity has a low risk tolerance,” he said. “If volatility rises and correlation takes away their ability to construct a well-diversified portfolio, they will pull it out of equities and back into liquid, safe, Treasury bonds.”

Sheer Fatigue

“Our view is that this sell-off centered on tech stocks has mostly to do with buying fatigue setting in, and that it represents a spontaneous adjustment in response to how the market’s giddiness caused a heavy concentration of buying to be directed at certain popular stocks,” wrote Masanari Takada, cross-asset strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in a note.

“It may be that a bullish narrative built around what the post-pandemic world might look like is distorting not only stock prices, but also the earnings forecasts that supposedly justify those stock prices.”

472,2020-09-03T22:00:00+00:00,"Apple App Store Draws New Scrutiny in Japan, Epicenter of Gaming","(Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc.’s decision to sue Apple Inc. over its mobile store practices has sparked new scrutiny in the massive Japanese gaming market, prompting complaints and questions about how to counter the tech giant’s dominance.

While Epic, publisher of the hit title Fortnite, focuses on the 30% revenue cut app stores typically take, Japanese game studios have broader concerns. They have long been unhappy with what they see as Apple’s inconsistent enforcement of its own App Store guidelines, unpredictable content decisions and lapses in communication, according to more than a dozen people involved in the matter.

Japan’s antitrust regulator said it will step up attention to the iPhone maker’s practices in the wake of the high-stakes legal clash. And in rare cases, prominent executives are beginning to speak out after staying silent out of fear of reprisal.

“I want from the bottom of my heart Epic to win,” Hironao Kunimitsu, founder and chairman of Tokyo-based mobile game maker Gumi Inc., wrote on his Facebook page.

Apple and Google hold a duopoly over the mobile app market outside China. Any publisher that wants a game to be played on iPhones or Android devices is effectively forced to distribute it via their app stores, sharing revenue from an initial purchase and future, related items.

Epic, whose Fortnite generates more than $1 billion annually from in-game purchases of virtual cosmetics and extras, sued both companies for what it considers excessive fees and for the right to sell game extras directly to players. Apple and Google have disputed those charges in court. The iPhone maker argues its cut is justified by its provision of security, development support and an audience of a billion users.

The iPhone is a huge revenue driver for game creators in Japan, including established names like Square Enix Holdings Co., which gets 40% of its group revenue from smartphone games, and Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. Sony Corp. has a multibillion-dollar mobile hit called Fate/Grand Order.

With 702,000 registered developers, Japan is home to one of the most creative developer communities. A recent study commissioned by Apple estimated the App Store ecosystem in Japan generated $37 billion in billings and sales in 2019 -- $11 billion in digital goods and services, $24 billion via physical goods and services and $2 billion from in-app advertising.

Yet the App Store is particularly problematic, according to game developers, compared with Google’s Android Play Store, where the approval process tends to be smoother and there’s better communication. There’s even a third-party service dubbed iOS Reject Rescue, designed to help developers navigate through the unpredictable approval process.

“Apple’s app review is often ambiguous, subjective and irrational,” said Makoto Shoji, founder of PrimeTheory Inc., which provides the rejection service. “Apple’s response to developers is often curt and boilerplate, but even with that, you must be polite on many occasions, like a servant asking the master what he wants next.”

Apple said it strives to give developers high-quality support by telephone or email, including through 1,400 advisers and customer service employees based in Japan. It has translated App Store review guidelines and this week released Japanese subtitles to its developer conference videos from the summer, setting out its latest thinking on optimal app design. Apple said the goal is to offer the best place for customers and developers to get and create apps.

The Japanese games industry is familiar with the 30% revenue share, since it originated with Nintendo Co. console cartridges back in the 1980s. Most developers don’t mind it, but they want to see better service, especially from Apple.

Developers complain that titles waiting for App Store review sometimes take weeks to be cleared. One local games studio said it gave up hosting seasonal in-game events, which can be a big revenue accelerator, because Apple didn’t respond to their update review request for more than a month.

“While Apple will never admit it, I think there are times when they simply forget an item’s in the review queue or they intentionally keep it untouched as a sanction to a developer giving them the wrong attitude,” said Shoji.

Apple said its app review team operates across two time zones and Japanese-speaking representatives are available to discuss particular apps over the phone with developers during local business hours.

In one case in November, cited by several game makers, Apple’s servers went down for more than a day without any notification to developers, undermining their efforts to diagnose the issue. The Cupertino, California-based company’s system status screens were also slow to indicate any trouble. Such malfunctions carry direct economic costs for creators, which Apple does not reimburse. Apple said it works hard to keep its App Store systems fully functional all the time.

Japanese firms also say the company flip flops at times on its interpretation of appropriate content and changes policies without advanced notice. Several game studios reported having characters that were approved on the interpretation they were dressed in swimsuits, then later rejected on the judgment that they were in underwear and thus sexualized. One developer who had implemented an in-game system that Apple approved, later saw the same code rejected by the App Store operator in a subsequent game.

Apple pointed out that its guidelines prohibit “overtly sexual or pornographic material” and stressed it has a responsibility to provide a safe and trusted place for users to get apps.

Tokyo-based games consultant Hisakazu Hirabayashi has seen the challenges first-hand. One development team checked their game’s revenue-making strategy with Apple several times before release, making sure Apple gave the go-ahead. Weeks after the app launched, the App Store owner changed its stance, saying the developer should take the function out of the app or the app’s distribution would be terminated, according to the consultant.

“Apple is a sheriff who sometimes makes unfair interpretations of the guidelines for its own benefit,” Hirabayashi said.

474,2020-09-03T16:20:29+00:00,Why the explosive stock market rally is suddenly crumbling,"A red-hot stock market may be starting to get crushed under the weight of its own inflated valuation.

Seemingly out of the blue, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked nearly 800 points on Thursday by early afternoon trading. More alarmingly, the Nasdaq Composite — which has led the rally off the late February lows — plunged about 4%.

Some of the sector’s strongest-performers in recent months were walloped Thursday: Amazon (-5%), Apple (-7%), Microsoft (-5%), Tesla (-7%), Zoom (-11%), Square (-7%) to name a few. Indeed the selloff in these tech giants has served as a red flag on the rally’s near-term sustainability for the bulls, which have also watched an under-the-radar rotation into more defensive names this week such as Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola.

Talk to those on the Street and a selloff right now makes sense, and is long overdue.

For starters, valuations on big tech names like Tesla have gotten completely out of whack with reasonable expectations on forward earnings. A signal on that front was sent on Tesla Wednesday, as one of its largest shareholders Baillie Gifford trimmed its stake after a meteoric run-up in the stock. Meantime, billionaire investor Mario Gabelli hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer he may soon trim some of his position in Apple (another 2020 high-flyer).

And then there is the raw economic data that hasn’t improved much in recent weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. Or at least hasn’t turned around enough to warrant the S&P 500 trading at a lofty forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22 times.

“It could be the start [of a correction],” Belpointe Asset Management chief strategist David Nelson told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. “I don’t think the stock market — and particularly the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — really represents what is going on in the economy.” Exterior of New York Stock Exchange Building with classical architecture of Greece columns and US flags as seen during the day, NYSE Financial organization at Wall Street a symbol for the global and American Economy as one of the most powerful financial institute at lower Manhattan New York City, United States of America.

To top it all off, there are the seasonal September forces — and what will be a heated presidential election — the bulls seem to have forgotten about.

Story continues

September tends to be a weak month for stocks historically. In fact, according to LPL Financial, September has been the worst-performing month for markets, on average, since 1950. The S&P 500 has dropped about 1% on average that month since 1950, LPL Financial data shows. The only other month to record a drop on average (and a minuscule one at that) going back to 1950 is August.

But this time around, September being lackluster for markets could be further solidified because of election-related uncertainty. LPL Financial data reveals that the S&P 500 has shed 0.2% on average in an election year.

“When we look at Tesla, it’s trading at a market cap of $455 billion which is 10 times what General Motors is trading at. And so we have to wonder can fundamental analysis sustains some of these valuations? When we look at Zoom, it’s trading at more than IBM and at a P/E ratio of over 500 times versus IBM at 15 times. What I think is happening is investors are starting to scrutinize the valuations a bit more,” says Greg Branch, an adviser at 1847 Financial.

476,2020-09-02T21:30:00+00:00,"U.S. Tech Bans, Pandemic No Match for Asia’s Electronics Rebound","(Bloomberg) -- The electronics sector has found a way to thrive amid the global pandemic, with 5G demand helping the industry remain a rare catalyst for Asian factories.

South Korean computer sales surged 107% in August and semiconductor shipments grew for a third month in the past four, even as smartphone sales declined and overall exports fell 9.9% from a year earlier, figures out Tuesday showed.

Taiwan’s manufacturing output rose 2.6% in July, while production of computers and integrated circuits climbed by double digits. Shipments of electronics products from Singapore rose in July for a third straight month.

The latest data bolster forecasts that this year’s electronics rebound will persist, even as a U.S. ban on Huawei Technologies Co., further U.S.-China trade tensions and an eventual tapering of demand for work-from-home equipment present obstacles for the industry.

Relentless demand for 5G-related applications, including infrastructure and smartphones, is poised to keep electronics production humming as other output struggles to recover from the pandemic. Even the latest technology bans on Huawei look to be just a stumbling block.

“It’s kind of a little bit of a bump,” Rajan Rajgopal, chief executive officer of Singapore-based DenseLight Semiconductors Pte., said in an Aug. 28 interview.

Two areas of business especially have been booming since before the pandemic: data centers and 5G infrastructure, said Rajgopal, who’s worked in semiconductors for about 25 years. China accounts for about half of DenseLight’s customer base and could take an increasing share as it builds out its next-generation wireless infrastructure across the country -- boosting demand for semiconductors that go into devices as diverse as street cameras and oil-pipeline sensors.

Global semiconductor industry revenue is set to slip by only 0.9% this year to $415.4 billion amid pandemic-related disruptions, according to Gartner Inc. estimates.

Still, significant risk factors are keeping electronics watchers on guard. U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential re-election in November could mean more headaches for Asian supply chains, while it’s unclear how his rival for the White House, former Vice President Joe Biden, would alter U.S. strategy toward China. And retailers across sectors are bracing for a holiday season that could disappoint if government stimulus wears off and labor markets worsen.

Story continues

For now, though, companies expect the electronics boom to overcome the risks -- with Taiwanese firms seeing themselves particularly well-placed to ride out the storm. Industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is charting a “PC resurgence” amid Covid-19, C.C. Tsai, senior director of the company’s Asia-Pacific business, said in a video for a company symposium Aug. 25.

Despite concerns that increased work-from-home orders for things like laptops and webcams would prove temporary, computer demand “continues to remain robust,” and many consumers spending more time at home are also upgrading their television sets, Chairman Fang Leuh of Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., a TSMC affiliate that specializes in power management chips and display driver chips, told reporters Aug. 29.

That matches the read of Quanta Computer Inc., which makes Apple Inc. MacBooks, HP Inc. notebooks and servers for Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google. Elton Yang, chief financial officer of Taiwan-based Quanta, says notebook shipments are expected to grow by double digits in the third quarter.

“Strong orders from our customers confirm shelter-in-place demand is long-term,” Quanta Chairman Barry Lam told reporters Aug. 13. “We will create more products for the shelter-in-place economy to optimize our profitability. This is a big change. We will grab it and gain better opportunities.”

Industry executives acknowledge greater uncertainties around the trade war, U.S. elections and Covid-19, while taking a longer view on the prospects for electronics.

Apple, for example, has asked suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year -- roughly in line with last year’s launch -- a sign that demand for the company’s most important product is holding up despite the pandemic and recession.

Vanguard’s Fang emphasized very strong demand into 2021 for the type of semiconductors his company makes, aided by rollout of 5G technologies. And even if Trump wins another four-year term, complicating DenseLight’s China business, Rajgopal sees a brighter outlook.

“The electronics industry is a lot more resilient than eight years,” he said.

477,2020-09-02T21:30:00+00:00,"U.S. Tech Bans, Pandemic No Match for Asia’s Electronics Rebound","(Bloomberg) -- The electronics sector has found a way to thrive amid the global pandemic, with 5G demand helping the industry remain a rare catalyst for Asian factories.

South Korean computer sales surged 107% in August and semiconductor shipments grew for a third month in the past four, even as smartphone sales declined and overall exports fell 9.9% from a year earlier, figures out Tuesday showed.

Taiwan’s manufacturing output rose 2.6% in July, while production of computers and integrated circuits climbed by double digits. Shipments of electronics products from Singapore rose in July for a third straight month.

The latest data bolster forecasts that this year’s electronics rebound will persist, even as a U.S. ban on Huawei Technologies Co., further U.S.-China trade tensions and an eventual tapering of demand for work-from-home equipment present obstacles for the industry.

Relentless demand for 5G-related applications, including infrastructure and smartphones, is poised to keep electronics production humming as other output struggles to recover from the pandemic. Even the latest technology bans on Huawei look to be just a stumbling block.

“It’s kind of a little bit of a bump,” Rajan Rajgopal, chief executive officer of Singapore-based DenseLight Semiconductors Pte., said in an Aug. 28 interview.

Two areas of business especially have been booming since before the pandemic: data centers and 5G infrastructure, said Rajgopal, who’s worked in semiconductors for about 25 years. China accounts for about half of DenseLight’s customer base and could take an increasing share as it builds out its next-generation wireless infrastructure across the country -- boosting demand for semiconductors that go into devices as diverse as street cameras and oil-pipeline sensors.

Global semiconductor industry revenue is set to slip by only 0.9% this year to $415.4 billion amid pandemic-related disruptions, according to Gartner Inc. estimates.

Still, significant risk factors are keeping electronics watchers on guard. U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential re-election in November could mean more headaches for Asian supply chains, while it’s unclear how his rival for the White House, former Vice President Joe Biden, would alter U.S. strategy toward China. And retailers across sectors are bracing for a holiday season that could disappoint if government stimulus wears off and labor markets worsen.

For now, though, companies expect the electronics boom to overcome the risks -- with Taiwanese firms seeing themselves particularly well-placed to ride out the storm. Industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is charting a “PC resurgence” amid Covid-19, C.C. Tsai, senior director of the company’s Asia-Pacific business, said in a video for a company symposium Aug. 25.

VirnetX announced today that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has ruled that Apple is not entitled to relief from having to pay VirnetX almost $440 million for infringing on its patents related to Apple's VPN-on-demand feature. Apple FaceTime feature on iPhone and iPad

Image source: Apple.

The case stems from a 2010 case in which the internet security specialist accused Apple of infringing on its patents relating to secure networks -- called virtual private networks (VPNs) -- and secure communications links in Apple's FaceTime videoconferencing app.

Although VirtnetX has been referred to as a patent troll with its contention that it owns most of the crucial patents related to security across the internet, it has gone after most of the top tech stocks, including Apple, Cisco, and Microsoft, to enforce them, and has been mostly successful.

Apple appealed its loss all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and while it has won minor victories along the way, such as rulings that FaceTime doesn't infringe on the patents, the larger battles have fallen VirnetX's way, and Apple may be running out of ways to avoid paying the judgment.

The latest decision derives from Apple's appeal of a federal court's ruling that its VPN-on-demand feature, which allows you to configure a secure connection anonymously to keep your data safe, violated two of VirnetX's patents.

VirnetX was awarded a total of $439.7 million in damages.

484,2020-08-31T22:00:07+00:00,You Think FAANG Is Distorting the S&amp;P? Consider ATM,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have lamented the lack of depth in the U.S. stock market, marveling at how a handful of big tech companies have grown to dominate almost a quarter of the S&P 500 and become responsible for all of this year’s gain. But that lopsidedness is nothing next to China, where the top three stocks in the benchmark MSCI China Index now have more than a 38% weight.

At this rate, instead of buying passive funds that track the MSCI index, investors might as well just pile into China’s version of FAANG, known locally as ATM: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and food delivery super-app Meituan Dianping.

There’s nagging unease that ATM’s economic prospects aren’t as sound as those of Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. In the U.S., deeply entrenched user behavior has protected tech companies from stepping on each other’s toes. Americans shop on Amazon, search on Google, and stream on Netflix.

In China, however, the competitive landscape is a lot murkier. Alibaba continues to face fierce competition from JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. Meanwhile, Jack Ma’s empire is still fighting with Tencent over mobile payments. As for Meituan Dianping, how many century stocks — companies with a market cap north of $100 billion — have rallied more than 160% so far this year? Meituan is eclipsed only by Tesla Inc. So it’s not unnatural to ask how much further ATM can go.

Passive fund flows, unleashed by the super dovish tone of the Federal Reserve, are propelling these three stocks even higher. That makes beating the benchmark MSCI China Index an impossible task. Value investing remains a losing game, because banks, the only segment big enough to tilt the index, are still struggling with bad loan writedowns.

To outperform the index and reduce reliance on ATM, then, investors have no choice but to hunt for smaller growth stocks. JD.com and Pinduoduo, for instance, are hedges against the Alibaba behemoth; both saw their market caps more than double this year. Electric vehicle startups XPeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have launched successful IPOs, as investors increasingly see the industry as recession-proof.

Story continues

Meanwhile, bullish equity analysts are telling tall tales to justify sky-high valuations. In mid-May, Zhongtai Securities Co. published a research report arguing that the baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai Co. is gold-like as an effective hedge against irresponsible central banks printing trillions of dollars of new money. Quantitative easing tends to benefit the rich, and has only created bubbles; as a scarce asset, Moutai is a good buy, the brokerage argued. The liquor maker hit a fresh high Monday, and is now valued at an eye-popping 48 times 2020 earnings.

While it’s understandable that the rich may want to celebrate their stock gains this year with a $300 bottle of Moutai, hot-pot chain operator Haidilao International Holding Ltd.’s meteoric rise is more puzzling. The Chinese are still apprehensive about dining out, recent macro retail data show, and Haidilao posted 965 million yuan ($139.5 million) in losses in the first half, versus 911 million yuan net profit in the same period last year.

But now Haidilao is seen as a robotics play. It opened its first smart, automated restaurant in Beijing almost two years ago. Once artificial intelligence is involved, profitability no longer matters.

There are plenty of other examples. Investors have crowded into expensive after-school education stocks as well as duty-free goods operators, all as attempts to diversify from ATM. When we’re in a bull market, pigs can fly.

For months, we’ve been worried that a top-heavy stock market would be vulnerable to a crash. One generous line of thinking has been that value stocks will perk up once economies recover, and indexes will look more balanced. That may well be the case, but until that day comes — and it could take years — the ATMs and FAANGs of the world have already distorted stock investing into an unrecognizable form.

486,2020-08-28T20:37:52+00:00,'This is a liquidity driven rally': Zor Capital’s Joe Fahmy on why the market will head higher into the 2020 election,"Joe Fahmy, Zor Capital Managing Director, joined The Final Round to discuss the market rally, what's driving it, and his thoughts on how the 2020 election will impact the market.

Video Transcript

JEN ROGERS: Well, we've got a great Yahoo Finance lineup for everyone today-- Rick Newman, Akiko Fujita, Jared Blikre. But as Myles said, our friend of the program Joe Fahmy is here from Zor Capital. He's the managing director there, so let's bring him in, see what he has to say.

I mean, Joe, I was-- before we came up, I was trying to explain the market to a child. And I said something like, this market is crazy. And they're like, why? And I said, well, it's just really high, and everything else is going on. And they said, well, why can't it go higher? And I was like, I guess that's a really good question. I mean, it-- to people, it seems out of whack. Why is it not?

JOE FAHMY: I mean, you have to make adjustments to the conditions we're in, and this is a liquidity-driven rally where interest rates are low. The Fed is a huge factor along with it. I wrote an article for you guys a couple of weeks ago saying I think we're heading higher into the election because the Fed is one reason. There's very little professional selling. And the leaders are acting very, very well. There's a lot of positives to this market, but the main thing is the liquidity.

JEN ROGERS: OK, so why is it all about liquidity here? Is this-- is it a don't fight the Fed situation? We had Brian Cheung on last hour talking about the changes that the Fed has made, and he said that we could be here for eight to 10 years. Am I-- I mean, Myles, you were in the program, right? I got that right-- eight to 10 years that we could have--

MYLES UDLAND: I mean, that's what happened last time, right? I mean, so sure.

JEN ROGERS: It's-- that's a long time.

JOE FAHMY: I mean, the other thing a lot of people aren't talking about is that a lot of money managers are underperforming because they got it wrong earlier this year-- and I understand that-- and they discounted how much the Fed was really helping the markets. So what's-- when you talk about the narrow leadership that you alluded to earlier is that if these big managers that might need to put $100 million or $1 billion into the markets, they have a narrow universe of stocks that they can choose from.

Story continues

So what they will obviously chase with is the top NASDAQ-- you know, top 10, not even NASDAQ 100 stocks. We all know the names and the FANGs and the Microsofts and so forth. Because one, it's easy to get, as far as liquid, into those names. And two, they're companies with reliable earnings, so that is also what's driving the markets higher.

RICK NEWMAN: Hey, just-- Joe, just to go back to your idea that stocks could rise into the election, I-- number-- first of all, it seems to me, the markets have seemed to have decided they can live with Joe Biden. So it doesn't seem to be likely any kind of slump if Joe Biden really starts to surge ahead. But does that suggest there could be a dip after the election or sell-off?

JOE FAHMY: Yeah, that could be. I mean, there's a lot of variables. So you know, when I said, we're running higher into the election, a lot of people have asked me, well, what happens after that? I said, well, we'll worry about that when we get to it. But there's a lot of variables. If there's not a clear winner decided on election day, that could be uncertainty for the markets. I'm sure a lot of people will be hedged for either scenario. If Biden does win, there'll be a lot of hedging. So that could keep a floor to the markets.

But overall-- this isn't a political statement-- I think Trump is going to do everything in his power to get re-elected. That's just a commonsense statement. Anyone running for re-election wants to get re-elected. So whether it's keeping pressure on the Fed or some possible, you know, tax cuts, various stimulus, that's going to continue to keep the markets afloat, of course with dips along the way, but I think they're going to be shallow over the next couple months.

AKIKO FUJITA: So Joe, shouldn't that statement alone be considered a risk? If you're talking about the president doing whatever it takes to win, I mean, we've heard everything from him talking about approval for some kind of-- one of the vaccine candidates. We've seen-- I mean, there-- the trade issue with China. I mean, what we have seen over the last few months is the president willing to put pressure where he can if he knows that it's going to resonate coming into November.

JOE FAHMY: Yeah, that's a great question, and I'm only saying this because Trump is clearly running on an economic platform, especially talks a lot about, you know, one of the few presidents who has ever discussed the stock market so much. It can be a risk, but that's where people really need to understand whether they're long-term investors and they're probably sticking with it longer term or if they're shorter-term traders where they obviously have to manage their risk.

And I'm not saying, you know, OK, just the teacher's out of the classroom and, you know, just have fun. I'm just saying that it's a rare equity-friendly environment. Take advantage of it. But of course, you need to have-- you need to manage your risk around that in case-- the reasons that I've said for why it's going higher, in case any of those reasons change, such as the big institutions start to show signs of selling. But right now, they're not.

RICK NEWMAN: Joe, are we going to see at some point, like in our lifetimes, the stock market reconnecting to the real economy, or can this just go on indefinitely?

JOE FAHMY: I mean, that's a great question. At some point, there will be, you know, some profit taking or if the Fed hints that they are not raising rates, but you know, a change of tone from them. I mean, it's a great question. Obviously, it can't go on indefinitely. But it can go on.

One thing I've learned from doing this 21 years is moves in the stock market can go on much longer than we expect in both directions. So until I see any major warning signs, I'm sticking with the trend. But I mean, obviously, at some point, this will end with, you know, some sort of bigger correction. But there'll be warning signs, you know, in the markets before that happens.

MYLES UDLAND: And Joe, I don't know if you have a very strong view on this, but it seems that most people do, which is the idea of narrow leadership. And we saw-- you just mentioned earlier, the 10 names that are doing all the work. Obviously, I think that performance-chasing thesis is a big part of why those names are so relentlessly big. But I'm sure you hear from folks who say, you know, oh, well, financials don't get involved, this rally can't continue. But I mean, it just seems that everyone is fixated on that state of play, and I'm just not sure if it is such a requirement of a bull run that each sector have its turn at the front.

JOE FAHMY: I mean, there is a lot of sector Rotation I mean, my wise-guy answer to when they say the market's only going up on 10 stocks, I say, well, then just be in those 10 stocks. But that does work for people. But I am seeing some sector rotation. I am seeing some financials. They might not be participating big, but they're stabilizing.

There's definitely housing stocks that are acting well and a few other sectors outside of tech-- you know, the payments space, which is a sign of the economy opening back up. So I am seeing more than just those 10 stocks. If they're not screaming higher, that's OK, but at least they are participating somewhat.

RICK NEWMAN: Joe, you said before that if there is some kind of sustained sell-off, we will see signs that it is coming. What would those signs be? What should we be looking for?

JOE FAHMY: I mean, I like to watch the technicals of the market. I'll give you two really quick. If you start to see, you know, some big volume come into the market consistently, to see any major market top-- you know, I wrote about this in the article about a distribution day, meaning a big down day on heavy volume. To see any major market top, you need to see four or five or six of them in a short period of time. So that's one. And then from a technical point, just a simple 50-day moving average-- as long as the market's holding above that, for the most part, it's healthy. If we start to break below key moving averages from a technical point of view, that's when I would get more defensive and more cautious.

JEN ROGERS: Joe Fahmy with Zor Capital, you heard him talk about the article he's written for us. It's up on our website right now if you want to read more into what Joe's talking about. ""Why The Stock Market Could Head Higher Into The Presidential Election,"" that's the headline. Joe, fantastic to see you. Have a great weekend.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Display said on Friday it has agreed to sell a smartphone screen plant in central Japan to Sharp Corp for $390 million, raising funds to repay debt it owes Apple Inc for the plant construction costs.

The company said in a statement it will also sell screen plant equipment at the liquid crystal display (LCD) factory to ""an overseas customer"" for $285 million, or $85 million more than the amount announced in March. Sources said the customer is Apple.

Japan Display owes Apple $702.5 million for the $1.5 billion cost of building the plant five years ago, and the Japanese supplier said the $675 million raised from the plant and equipment sale would be used for repayment.

Sharp, a supplier of sensors, camera modules and LCD screens for Apple's iPhones, is buying the central Japan plant at the request of Apple and plans to consolidate its iPhone panel production there, a source familiar with the matter said.

Representatives at Apple's Japanese unit were not immediately available for comment. Sharp declined to comment on its panel strategy and customers.

Sharp, a unit of Taiwan's Foxconn, has been operating its own smartphone panel plant almost at full capacity, in part due to the popularity of Apple's new lower cost iPhone SE.

Sharp will use the vacated smartphone panel lines at its existing LCD plant to boost production of panels for autos and medical equipment, said the source, who declined to be identified because the issue is private.

491,2020-08-25T22:00:11+00:00,FANGMAN Is No Match for These 'Seven Princesses',"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have marveled at how the U.S. stock market has become dominated by Big Tech. Just a handful of companies — captured by acronyms such as FANG, FAANG and even FANGMAN — have emerged as winners in the Covid-19 world.

This is by no means a phenomenon unique to the U.S. In South Korea, investors have crowded into what’s known locally as the seven princesses: two biotechs, two electric-vehicle battery makers and three internet companies. On average, they have rallied about 90% this year, outperforming FAANG stocks (Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent, Alphabet Inc.). Together, the princesses account for more than 18% of the Kospi Index, promising to overtake the ultimate blue chip, Samsung Electronics Co. as the dominant market mover.

South Korean equities have weathered a seismic shift this year. Retail investors, who dabbled in cryptocurrencies and all sorts of exotic structured products in the past, are now buying domestic stocks. They single-handedly supported the main stock index as foreigners fled.

But unlike investors from abroad, who see the Kospi as a mere cyclical semiconductor play, locals are hunting for the next Samsung, one that will thrive in a society rewritten by trade wars and Covid-19. In their view, the smartphone supply chain is yesterday’s story. U.S. President Donald Trump was unraveling it well before the coronavirus outbreak.

Instead, the Koreans are beaming with national pride at the sophistication of their advanced medical supplies and technology, and the country’s success in controlling the pandemic. Two of the princesses, Samsung Biologics Co. and Celltrion Inc., play right into that sentiment.

Just as its sibling Samsung Electronics makes memory chips for Apple’s iPhone, Samsung Biologics seeks to leverage the conglomerate’s manufacturing prowess to make drugs and vaccines for Big Pharma. Earlier this month, the company laid out an ambitious plan to build a fourth plant, its largest by far, boosting its total capacity 71% and turning it into the world’s largest biopharmaceutical manufacturer. Meanwhile, Celltrion is introducing two coronavirus testing kits in the U.S.; last month, its Covid-19 antibody drug entered phase one clinical trials.

Story continues

EV battery manufacturing is another sector many Koreans see as Covid-proof (just look at Tesla Inc.’s stock). It’s also an area where the country already has an edge, given Samsung SDI Co. and LG Chem Ltd. are global leaders. The battery makers can see rising demand ahead. China has extended its EV subsidies until 2022 to support the industry, while the European Union has earmarked 30% of its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion), seven-year budget for climate-related spending.

And don’t forget, Korea has state-of-the-art internet infrastructure, which enables e-commerce and video gaming when people are stuck at home. Unlike traditional retail sales, Korea’s lockdown didn’t even make a dent in e-commerce. Online shopping has bigger penetration than in the U.S., accounting for about 30% of the total retail value versus 20%. This benefits Naver Corp., Kakao Corp. and video-game developer NCSoft Corp., the three internet princesses.

On a traditional price-to-earnings basis, none of the seven princesses is coming cheap. But what’s valuation in the world of easy money? As the Bank of Korea pushes its benchmark rate to near zero, future earnings — as far as a decade down the road — don’t need to be discounted.

You could even go a step further and argue the princesses are a more diversified bunch than FANGMAN, which all orbit around smartphones. The Koreans know better than to pin their hopes on one prince charming.

The WeChat owner rallied 5.8% at the close in Hong Kong Monday, making it the best performer on the benchmark Hang Seng Index, after people familiar with matter said the Trump administration is privately seeking to reassure U.S. companies including Apple Inc. that they can still do business with Tencent’s WeChat messaging app in China. In recent days, senior administration officials have been reaching out to some companies, realizing that the impact of an all-out ban on the popular app could be devastating for U.S. technology, retail, gaming, telecommunications and other industries, according to the people.

Company management earlier this month sought to reassure investors that the executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Aug. 6 may apply only to WeChat’s overseas operations. The ban, which came amid efforts by the White House to curtail the rise of Chinese-owned technology giants like Huawei Technologies Co. and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., had erased roughly $66 billion from Tencent’s value, though today’s rebound means the stock has recouped all but $9 billion of those losses.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Intense lobbying by representatives of U.S. businesses such as Walmart, General Motors, Best Buy and Target reinforces the indispensability of WeChat for reaching consumers in China. The sales impact on Tencent from President Donald Trump’s WeChat ban may be minimal as the administration appears to be narrowing the scope of the order to protect U.S. businesses in China.

Spreads on Tencent’s dollar bond due 2030 tightened 2 basis points, according to credit traders in Hong Kong Monday morning, the most since August 11. Shares of Prosus NV, the Naspers Ltd. unit that holds 31% in Tencent, gained as much as 3.6%, while Naspers climbed 2.9%.

Trump ignited a furor after signing the order to ban U.S. entities from dealing with WeChat. Confusion reigned as investors grappled with the sweeping language of Trump’s order -- which bars “transactions” with the Chinese company -- that leaves the door open for the administration to extend it well beyond the service in America. Apple’s shares fell on fears the action could hurt sales of iPhones in its largest market after the U.S.

Still, risks remain until details of the executive order are finalized. Senior administration officials are deliberating over the scope of the ban ordered by Trump, one of the people said, and the president could ultimately overrule anything they decide.

Even if corporations are permitted to do business with WeChat, individuals may still face restrictions on using the app in the U.S. A group of U.S. WeChat users filed a complaint at the federal court in San Francisco Friday in an attempt to block the Trump administration from imposing a ban on the app, saying it would violate their rights.

Apple Korea has been under investigation by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over allegations it abused its dominant position by forcing mobile carriers to pay for advertising and warranty repairs, the commission has said.

Apple has agreed to fix ""unfair"" terms with mobile carriers as part of its proposal, the KFTC said in a briefing. For example, Apple will discuss how to share advertising costs with telecoms firms, which will help reduce burdens to carriers, the KFTC said.

Apple Korea was not immediately available for comment.

Out of the 100 billion won, Apple pledged to offer 40 billion won to build a centre to support research and development for Korea's small manufacturers and 25 billion won to establish an ""academy"" to provide education to developers. Another 25 billion won will be used to give consumer discounts on warranty repair costs and other benefits.

The regulator will close the case without concluding whether Apple did anything illegal if it finds the proposed remedies reasonable after collecting public opinion.

In 2019, Apple held an 18% share in South Korea's mobile phone market, the home turf of Samsung Electronics, which controlled 65% of the market, according to data from researcher Counterpoint.

Apple faces antitrust pressure in other countries. In March, French regulators fined Apple 1.1 billion euros ($1.23 billion), saying the iPhone maker was guilty of anti-competitive behaviour toward its distribution and retail network. Apple said at that time that it would appeal to the decision.

498,2020-08-21T17:42:52+00:00,7 Index Funds To Buy For A Firm Portfolio Foundation,"An index typically tracks returns on a buy-and-hold basis and therefore constitutes a passive investment approach. An index fund, also known as exchange-traded fund (ETF), is a basket of securities — some combination of stocks, bonds and commodities. Many of these funds track various indices and help investors diversify their portfolio holdings.

Over the past three decades, index funds have become some of the most popular passive investment vehicles among retail and professional investors. Low transaction costs and intraday liquidity are among the biggest benefits for investors. And even in these uncertain times, new investors are wading into the stock market.

Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., associate professor of Finance at California State University, Long Beach, spoke with InvestorPlace via email to offer some advice to new investors. She says:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

“Beginning investors need to keep in mind that the opportunity to enter the financial markets is based on institutional and regulatory protections, as well as the need to time the entry. The goal is to buy low, minimize fees and let long term diversified investments take care of market fluctuations. There is no need to invest large amounts. The key is to start small, strategically, and don’t wait until middle age.”

With all that background information, here are seven index funds for long-term portfolios:

Direxion Work From Home ETF (NYSEARCA:WFH) Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (NASDAQ:PDBC) iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) SPDR S&P 500ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSEARCA:FEZ) Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI)

These ETFs cover a wide range of asset classes and allocations, so there’s something for everyone, no matter your investing style.

Index Funds to Buy: Direxion Work From Home ETF (WFH)

52-week range: $49.20-$55.83 Expense Ratio: 0.45% per year, or $45 on a $10,000 investment. an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights

The Direxion Work From Home ETF is one of the newest exchange traded funds on the market. It started trading on June 25, at an opening price of $50.08. On August 5, it notched an all-time high of $55.83.

It tracks the Solactive Remote Work Index, which comprises businesses offering technological infrastructure and services in four industries: cloud technologies, cybersecurity, remote communications, online project and document management.

The Solactive Remote Work Index consists of 40 companies, ten from each industry group. The top five holdings of the Direxion Work From Home ETF are Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Inseego (NASDAQ:INSG), Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Avaya (NYSE:AVYA) and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA). These make up approximately 18% of the total value of the fund.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered structural shifts in the way people, worldwide, are now living their lives. 2020 is quickly becoming the year of  ‘home sweet home’ for many.

Thematic investing may enable market participants to diversify their portfolios while capturing trends such as stay-at-home and work-from-home. And this index fund may act as a basis for further research.

As always, investors should consider individual investment goals along with risks/return profiles and charges/expenses of each fund, such as WFH.

Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (PDBC)

52-week range: $11.08-$16.91 Dividend Yield: 1.68% Expense Ratio: 0.61% per year, or $61 on a $10,000 investment. a bunch of oil barrels are stacked high

The Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF invests in commodity-linked futures and other financial instruments that provide access to a diverse group of commodities.

PDBC aims to provide a long-term capital appreciation strategy that surpasses the performance of DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return, an index composed of futures contracts on 14 commodities across energy, precious metals, industrial metals and agriculture.

Gold, Gasoline, Crude Crude and Brent Crude futures have the highest weightings, comprising close to 45% of the funds. Wheat, Sugar, Soybeans and Corn make up 25.61% of the fund, while Copper, Aluminum and Zinc compose 13.93% of the ETF. Other holdings include NY Harbor ULSD, Natural Gas and Silver.

Year-to-date, the fund is down over 16%. Commodity prices are mostly dependent on supply and demand. For example, during a cold winter, as the demand for natural gas increases, so do prices. Commodity prices also typically move higher during inflationary periods, as they are widely considered a hedge against inflation.

Historically, there has been a negative correlation between commodities and stocks. Academic research shows that by investing in commodity futures or ETFs based on these contracts, market participants may be able to decrease the volatility of an all-stock portfolio without reducing their expected return.

Thus investors trying to diversify into commodities should consider this index fund further.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB)

52-week range: $92.15-$146.53 Dividend Yield: 0.29% Expense Ratio: 0.47% per year, or $47 on a $10,000 investment floating molecules representing biotech stocks like SRNE stock

Source: Shutterstock

Launched in 2001, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF is one of the largest ETFs, and it’s run by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager.

The fund tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, comprised of NASDAQ-listed companies classified as either biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies that meet additional criteria.

IBB’s five largest holdings are Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). These five make up around 35% of the fund, which invests in a total of 212 companies.

Year-to-date, IBB is up over 12%. In fact, on July 20, it hit a new all-time high. Given the recent increases in prices of individual shares, there may be some short-term profit-taking around the corner. A decline toward the $125 level is likely, which would provide potential IBB investors with a better entry point.

Within the biopharma industry, IBB could be appropriate for a wide range of long-term buy-and-hold investors with a high tolerance for short-term market fluctuations.

iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)

52-week range: $95.69-$170.56 Dividend Yield: 1.3% Expense Ratio: 0.19% per year, or $19 on a $10,000 investment. a ticker board that says ""SMALL CAP"" among various ticker increases

Source: Shutterstock

Small-cap stocks can boost portfolio diversification and increase potential returns over time. For those looking to invest in U.S.-listed small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF may be a strong candidate.

IWM tracks the Russell 2000 and covers practically all industries. Late-stage biotech Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), in-home healthcare provider LHC Group (NASDAQ:LHCG), footwear corporation Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), global consumer product company Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) and BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) are among the top big name holdings.

Year-to-date, IWM is down about 6%. Put another way, in recent weeks, small-caps have been lagging large-caps. Over the long-run, small-cap stocks and small-cap index funds often outperform their large-cap counterparts. However, they are typically more volatile.

SPDR S&P 500ETF (SPY)

52-week range: $218.26-$339.10 Dividend Yield: 1.69% Expense Ratio: 0.04% per year, or $4 on a $10,000 investment. Street sign for Wall Street pictured in front of several American flags representing american stocks

The S&P 500 measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies in the US. These companies make up around 80% of the overall US stock market’s value and cover approximately 24 separate industry groups. The capitalization-weighted SPDR S&P 500 ETF follows this index.

For many investors, the S&P’s performance shows how U.S. equities are performing in general. The “Spider” index is one of the most widely followed equity benchmarks in the world.

The SPY index fund value proposition is simple: Investors gain exposure to the growth and profitability of U.S.-based businesses without having to rely too heavily on any individual company’s performance.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (FEZ)

52-Week Range: $24.29 – 41.27 Dividend Yield: 1.59% Expense Ratio: 0.29% per year, or $29 on a $10,000 investment the European Union flag, a circle of gold stars on a navy blue background

Source: Shutterstock

The SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF, which has 50 holdings, follows the Euro Stoxx 50Index. While broader U.S. indices are likely to keep offering plenty of robust stocks, long-term investors may consider diversifying with shares of established companies listed in Europe, too.

The biggest sectors by weighting are Financials (14.08%), Information Technology (13.76%), Consumer Discretionary (13.66%), Industrials (12.42%) and Materials (10.81%). These five sectors account for 65% of the fund.

The total net assets stand at around $1.7 billion and the top ten holdings make up 42% of the fund. FEZ’s top five companies are SAP (NYSE:SAP), ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), Linde (NYSE:LIN), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC:LVMUY). In terms of geography, Eurozone members France, Germany and the Netherlands have the highest contribution, totaling close to 80%.

So far in the year, the fund is down close to 6%. However, it’s up over 50% from its lows of March.

In recent weeks, the economic data out of Europe hasn’t been much to write home about. However, the European Central Bank has announced a large stimulus package that will likely support the economy as well as share prices of solid European businesses.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF offers low-cost access to a broad basket of shares under one umbrella.

VTI, which tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, holds 3531 stocks covering all sectors and capitalizations, from mega- to micro-, in U.S. equity markets. Technology tops the list with a weighting of 26.4%, followed by Financials (16.3%), Consumer Services (14.2%) and Health Care (14.0%).

The fund’s top 3 holdings include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The top ten stocks make up close to a quarter of the fund.

Year-to-date, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is up 5.1%. However, that metric excludes the dividend yield of 1.69%. Research shows that investors who purchase dividend stocks and reinvest the dividends to buy more shares are likely to see considerable growth in their savings.

500,2020-08-19T18:38:22+00:00,Trump’s Attack on Goodyear Makes America Worse,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Donald Trump’s attempts to use the office of the presidency to call for a boycott of an American company have always been jarring and alarming. But the latest broadside against Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. feels particularly shortsighted.

On Wednesday, Goodyear joined a long list of corporations whose products the president has said should be shunned at one point or another. The list — which stretches even longer if you include companies targeted over the course of his campaign — is a who’s who of the American way of life, ranging from Apple Inc., AT&T Inc., Harley-Davidson Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc. He’s also threatened to cancel an order for a new Air Force One jet from Boeing Co. and yank unspecified subsidies for General Motors Co. The reasons for the boycotts range from disagreements over operating decisions such as factory relocations or product selection; a means of pressure for jobs initiatives; leverage for government contract negotiations; and just general dislike. He’s never cared very much if the issues that are the grist for his corporate attacks conflict with or are the result of some of his own policies, nor has he been particularly focused on achieving more than a publicity stunt in most instances.

But Goodyear is an especially curious target. The company’s biggest competitors are foreign companies such as Japan’s Bridgestone Corp., Germany's Continental AG and France’s Michelin. So when Trump tells his supports to “get better tires for far less,"" he would appear to be directing them to spend their dollars at the very same companies he’s spent the better part of the last four years trying to hamper with tariffs and political posturing.

Not to mention, Goodyear — based in the swing state of Ohio — actually operates factories in the U.S. at a time when the White House is angling to bring more manufacturing work back to America, and as the country faces an unprecedented slump in employment because of the coronavirus pandemic. A full-throttle boycott of Goodyear may affect the Americans working at the company, not to mention their attitude toward his re-election prospects. In 2016, Goodyear was one of 15 recipients of the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, ""the highest honor"" given to the private sector to recognize support for National Guard and Reserve workforce members.Goodyear’s offense is an image circulating on social media that appeared to list “acceptable” and “unacceptable” attire and messaging for the workplace. According to the visual, support for the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as LGBT initiatives, falls into the “acceptable” category; politically affiliated slogans or material (including the “Make America Great Again” attire featured in the Trump campaign) as well as support for the “All Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” movements are deemed “unacceptable.” In a statement, Goodyear said the slide wasn’t distributed by corporate headquarters and wasn’t part of a diversity training program, as was alleged on social media.

Story continues

It remains unclear who exactly created this visual. But once again, Trump’s instinct is to shoot first and ask questions later, a dangerous instinct for someone in charge of running an entire country. It feels particularly notable that his tweet is focused on the alleged ban on the MAGA attire his campaign popularized; he never misses an opportunity to worry about himself. Never mind that even if the slide deck is true, it would also appear to ban, say, t-shirts supporting Trump’s challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden.In other comments to local news outlets, Goodyear made a distinction between allowing employees to express themselves on issues of racial justice and equity in the aim of fostering a more respectful workplace, and wanting to avoid political campaigning for either side. It's an interesting portrait of the challenges corporate America is facing as companies try to respond to demands for social progress. But the complexity of that dilemma is lost on Trump.

Trump's not the only politician to target or boycott specific companies. Celebrities and prominent Democrats including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York panned Goya Foods earlier this year after the company's CEO expressed support for Trump. In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called on Trump to threaten to withhold defense contracts from United Technologies Corp. (now Raytheon Technologies Corp.) over the status of a factory in Indiana. It’s fair to question the potential ramifications of those calls on rank-and-file Americans, too. “Two can play the same game,” Trump said. But this isn’t high school and only one person is the president.

502,2020-08-18T09:58:39+00:00,IPhone Supplier Catcher to Sell China Units for $1.4 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Catcher Technology Co., a key provider of metal frames for iPhones, has agreed to sell two businesses in China to Lens Technology Co., joining a cohort of Taiwanese companies in diversifying away from the country and adding production capacities elsewhere amid worsening ties between Washington and Beijing.

Lens Tech will pay cash for the two units located in the eastern Chinese city of Taizhou and the transaction is expected to be completed before the end of this year pending government approval, Catcher said in a statement. The deal is tentatively priced at $1.43 billion and involves a plant that accounted for 40% of Catcher’s total sales in 2019, spokesman James Wu said at a briefing. The U.S.-China trade war and increasing price competition is facilitating supply chain consolidation, Wu added. Catcher still maintains some operations in China.

“Following iPhone assembler Pegatron’s acquisition of casing unit Casetek, Catcher is likely to lose its longtime partnership with Pegatron and lose market share within the Apple supply chain, so Catcher may be selling the plant to get some cash back,” GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said, adding that the plant is responsible for assembling metal frames and glass backs of iPhones. “For Lens, buying this plant that provides preliminary assembly service may boost the company’s chance at winning iPhone and iPad assembly orders in the future.”

The U.S.-China rivalry has led to a growing bifurcation in the global tech industry, prompting firms to diversify their manufacturing bases away from China. Catcher’s move comes a month after fellow Taiwanese electronics assembler Wistron Corp. agreed to sell its iPhone production plant in China to Luxshare Precision Industry Co., paving the way for Apple Inc. to gain its first Chinese handset maker.

Even before the sale of its China plant, Wistron had said it will be able to raise manufacturing capacities outside of China to 50% in 2021, according to Chairman Simon Lin. Bigger rival Foxconn Technology Group has boosted its capacity outside China from 25% last June to 30% now, while Taoyuan-based Quanta Computer Inc. is also doubling the size of a new Taiwan plant, which will come online next year.

Bigger rival Foxconn Technology Group has boosted its capacity outside China from 25% last June to 30% now, while Taoyuan-based Quanta Computer Inc. is also doubling the size of a new Taiwan plant, which will come online next year.

504,2020-08-18T07:48:43+00:00,Turkey’s Gaming Startups Have Attracted $2.4 Billion in Investments Since 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s mobile-gaming startups are seeking to cash in on a bout of deals, one of only a few bright spots in an economy hit by foreign portfolio outflows.

Games developers in Turkey attracted about $2.4 billion in investments over the past five years from the likes of Tencent Holdings, Netmarble Corp. and Zynga Inc. Their easy-to-play games have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times in a global sector expected to expand 9.3% this year to $160 billion, according to data compiled by Newzoo International BV.

“The interest will likely continue,” Ozgur Karayalcin, deputy chairman of the Ankara-based Association of Turkey’s Game Developers, said by phone.

A drop in the lira to a record against the dollar is boosting sales for developers that rely on international markets for most of their income. Lower costs and the ability of local firms to develop a game, test it and make it available for download within weeks are other draw cards, he said.

Turkey’s government also compensates developers for commission taken by Apple Inc.’s App Store or Alphabet Inc.’s Google Play Store.

“Coupled with lower development costs and a large base of software developers in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East relative to Western Europe and North America, this is leading many Western companies to step up their interest in acquisitions in the region, and in countries such as Turkey,” said Matthew Kanterman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in Hong Kong. “At the end of the day, it comes down to the developer, the team and talent they’ve assembled, and the intellectual property they’ve built.”

Zynga paid $168 million this month for 80% of Rollic Games, the Istanbul-based developer of Tangle Master 3D, among the most downloaded games in July, according to SensorTower Inc. Rollic’s Build Roads was the fourth most downloaded game in the U.S. on IPhones on Aug. 16, according to App Annie data.

Big Deals

That’s the San Francisco-based firm’s second deal this year after acquiring Peak for $1.8 billion, creating Turkey’s first gaming unicorn. Peak’s Toon Blast had 600,000 downloads and earned $14 million in July, compared with 11 million downloads and $16 million for Candy Crush Saga, one of the most popular mobile games, according to SensorTower.

To be sure, excluding the big-ticket deals, about two dozen gaming startups have received only $2.8 million in investment since 2015, said Serkan Unsal, founder of Istanbul-based Startups.Watch, a firm that monitors new firms.

“If we have a national strategy for this in the next five years, we can see a game industry that does not exit, but makes acquisitions,” he said. Otherwise, there’ll be another five to six more exits in the next five years.

The number of new gaming startups in the country rose to 44 in 2019, the highest since 2015, when Startups.Watch records began. Six companies were set up this year, taking the number of gaming startups to 239.

“Fostering that ecosystem attracts capital, creates well-paid jobs, and eventually tax-yielding profits,” said Roland Manger, the co-founder of Earlybird Venture Capital, which exited Peak after investing in 2011. “In five years, I can imagine that Turkey will be an even more significant hot spot of game creation and marketing.”

506,2020-08-18T01:36:37+00:00,U.S. Announces New Curbs on Huawei Access to U.S. Technology,"(Bloomberg) -- The Commerce Department announced further restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. aimed at cutting the Chinese company’s access to commercially available chips, the latest move in an increasingly tense relationship between the world’s two biggest economies.

The changes, which the department announced in a written statement on Monday, build on restrictions announced in May, adding 38 Huawei affiliates in 21 countries to an economic blacklist as the U.S. seeks to limit adoption of the company’s 5G technology.

“We don’t want their equipment in the United States because they spy on us,” President Donald Trump said Monday in an interview on “Fox and Friends.”

The move is the latest tit-for-tat in escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing over everything from the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic to China’s increasingly tight grip over Hong Kong. Despite the U.S. decision, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Fox Business that talks with China continue on various levels.

The restrictions are likely to further hit both Huawei’s 5G base stations and smartphone businesses because it relies heavily on foreign chips to make those, further denting China’s ambition to play a key role in global rollout of 5G technology. Huawei’s stockpiles of certain self-designed chips essential to telecom equipment will run out by early 2021.

Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB stand to benefit from Huawei’s further faltering in its 5G prowess, while domestic smartphone rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are likely to get a bigger pie of the Chinese market.

Ross said the action was aimed at closing loopholes the company explored after previous U.S. actions. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo praised the move as a “direct blow” against the Chinese Communist Party.

Shares of Huawei suppliers dropped sharply in Taiwan Tuesday morning after the U.S. announced the new curbs.

A Huawei spokesperson said Tuesday that the company was still reviewing the impact internally and that it had no immediate comment. China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent via WeChat.

Huawei has long rejected accusations that its technology can be used to spy on foreign nations or companies.

All chip companies working for Huawei, no matter where they are, will be subject to licenses, a Commercial official said, adding that even foreign companies will be affected as long as they use U.S. design software and equipment.

That means major Asian and European chip companies such as MediaTek Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., NXP Semiconductors NV, and STMicroelectronics NV may need a license to continue shipping to Huawei, though the official declined to name any specific company.

There are few semiconductor companies in the world, including those in China, that do not rely on software from U.S.-based Synopsys Inc. and Cadence Design Systems Inc. to create blueprints for chips. Many companies that make physical chips, including China’s own Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., use equipment from U.S.-based Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Reserach Corp.

‘Significant Disruption’

Among Synopsys and Cadence’s customers, Taiwan’s MediaTek has become a main chip provider to Huawei after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it will no longer ship chips to the Chinese company after Sept. 15. That’s due to the U.S.’s export-control rules added in May, which forbade companies from making chips based on Huawei’s design using American equipment.

John Neuffer, the president and chief executive officer of the U.S.’s Semiconductor Industry Association, said the rule “will bring significant disruption” to the sector.

“We are surprised and concerned by the administration’s sudden shift from its prior support of a more narrow approach intended to achieve stated national-security goals while limiting harm to U.S. companies,” Neuffer said in a statement. “We reiterate our view that sales of non-sensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation here in the U.S., which is critical to America’s economic strength and national security.”

The latest U.S. restrictions on Huawei are negative for European chipmakers, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a note, adding that a key risk for firms such as STMicroelectronics, AMS AG and Dialog Semiconductor PLC is Chinese retaliatory restrictions on major customer Apple Inc.

Additionally, assemblers that incorporate Huawei or third-party chips into their devices for the benefit of Huawei will also need to apply for a license, according to the Commerce official. That means Huawei smartphones assemblers, including Hong Kong-listed Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd., may be restricted by the new rules.

508,2020-08-13T04:49:14+00:00,"China’s Days as World’s Factory Are Over, IPhone Maker Says","(Bloomberg) --

A key supplier to Apple Inc. and a dozen other tech giants plans to split its supply chain between the Chinese market and the U.S., declaring that China’s time as factory to the world is finished because of the trade war.

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Chairman Young Liu said it’s gradually adding more capacity outside of China, the main base of production for gadgets from iPhones to Dell desktops and Nintendo Switches. The proportion outside the country is now at 30%, up from 25% last June.

That ratio will rise as the company -- known also as Foxconn -- moves more manufacturing to Southeast Asia and other regions to avoid escalating tariffs on Chinese-made goods headed to U.S. markets, Liu told reporters after his company reported financial results.

“No matter if it’s India, Southeast Asia or the Americas, there will be a manufacturing ecosystem in each,” Liu told investors on a conference call, adding that while China will still play a key role in Foxconn’s manufacturing empire, the country’s “days as the world’s factory are done.”

Foxconn said in a statement Thursday that, contrary to “inaccurate media reports,” management’s comments during the call did not refer to any specific companies, facilities or products, and were intended to reflect macroeconomic and industry trends.

Intensifying trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have pushed device manufacturers to diversify their production bases away from China, and Liu last year said that Apple’s most prized product, the iPhone, can be made outside China if needed. The two nations remain in trade talks, but Liu’s comments affirm a growing expectation that the China-centric electronics supply chain will fragment over the longer term.

The Taiwanese company reported better-than-expected net income of NT$22.9 billion ($778 million) for the quarter ended in June, a period that saw increased demand for iPads and MacBooks. Revenue was NT$1.13 trillion, but Hon Hai warned it expects its third-quarter sales will be down by double digits relative to 2019. Apple is expected to delay its iPhone launch this year.

Story continues

Hon Hai is bouncing back from a record profit slump in the first quarter as production at its factories recovered and shelter-in-place orders spurred demand for home computing equipment. The pandemic likely boosted iPad and Mac sales, even as Apple store closures weighed on iPhone sales, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on July 31 after reporting quarterly revenue that crushed estimates. Apple accounts for half of Hon Hai’s sales.

Even as Apple outperformed, Hon Hai’s other customers have fared less well. Hong Kong-listed subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd. said in its Aug. 7 earnings release that while Huawei Technologies Co.’s new phones have been popular in China, they missed expectations elsewhere following U.S. sanctions. Another key customer Xiaomi Corp. suffered a backlash in the Indian market amid growing tensions between China and the South Asian country. FIH lost $100 million in the first half.

Foxconn has been shaking up its traditionally China-focused operations. Hon Hai is among Apple assembly partners that plan to expand operations in India, potentially helping the iPhone maker grow its presence in the country of 1.3 billion and shift some of the U.S. company’s supply chain outside of China as ties between Washington and Beijing fray.

Chinese rivals are also posing a growing challenge. Local electronics titan Luxshare Precision Industry Co. is poised to become the first Chinese homegrown iPhone assembler after sealing a deal in July to buy an Apple handset production plant from Wistron Corp. While Hon Hai will keep assembly orders for premium iPhones, Luxshare will eat into the business for mid-to-entry-level Apple handsets, Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao wrote in a July 23 note.

Foxconn will work on its component business to maintain tech leadership and it also benefits from its long-term relationship with Apple, Liu said in response to several analysts’ questions about Foxconn’s competitive strategy against the rising Chinese supplier.

Orders could be further affected after President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring U.S. residents from doing business with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat. Annual iPhone shipments could plunge 25%-30% if Apple is forced to remove the app from its app stores worldwide, TF International Securities analyst Kuo Ming-chi warned in an August 9 note.

510,2020-08-11T10:40:15+00:00,SoftBank Moves Into Asset Management After Return to Profits,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son is launching a new asset management venture to buy stocks in publicly traded companies, expanding SoftBank Group Corp.’s investment efforts as it rebounded from record losses to profitability.

The Tokyo-based company reported net income of 1.26 trillion yen ($11.8 billion) for the three months ended June 30, following a loss of 1.44 trillion yen three months earlier. The profit was boosted by more than 1 trillion yen in one-time gains from the sale of Sprint Corp. and shares in T-Mobile US Inc.

Son has shifted his attention to investments in recent years after building his fortune in the telecom sector. The asset management initiative expands on previous efforts like the $100 billion Vision Fund, which he set up three years ago to take stakes in private startups. The new arm has already purchased shares in Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.

“As an investment company, we need to explore various angles and scope. But our focus is still on companies driving the information revolution,” said Son. “This is the purpose of our company.”

SoftBank will own 67% of the asset management firm, while Son personally will own the rest. The unit has about $555 million in capital, he said.

It’s not clear why Son thinks SoftBank will have an edge in picking stocks, moving into a field crowded with heavyweights like Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. The effort may increase the volatility of SoftBank earnings, which has grown with initiatives like the Vision Fund.

“Investors will need to build greater risk into their expectations -- and Masa investing alongside is not a good look,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Research who writes for Smartkarma. “Launching a new investment vehicle targeted at public tech when Nasdaq is near all-time highs with bubble concerns seems like a good way to keep the share price discount to public value from closing.”

The Japanese billionaire has pulled off a remarkably speedy comeback after the worst loss in his company’s 39-year history. A global rally in technology shares lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio, from China’s Didi Chuxing to South Korea’s Coupang.

Far from striking a winning pose on Tuesday however, Son emphasized the importance of defense. He opened his presentation with slides depicting a 16th century battle between two Japanese lords. Oda Nobunaga, who would go on to unify Japan, won the engagement by sheltering his riflemen inside a wooden structure to protect them from samurai on horseback.

“You can’t skimp on defense,” Son said. “We need to strengthen our defense. Defense is cash.”

SoftBank also stopped reporting operating profit, long a key metric tracked by investors. It said the figure is “no longer meaningful” as the company becomes a “strategic investment holding company.”

SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt. The company already raised 4.3 trillion yen through sales that include stakes in T-Mobile, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and its domestic telecom unit, completing about 95% of the program.

The Vision Fund returned to profitability, following a 1.13 trillion yen loss in the previous quarter. SoftBank booked a 296.6 billion yen gain on Vision Fund investments in the quarter, including 111.4 billion yen in realized gains after selling a portion of its shares in four listed portfolio companies. About $1.4 billion of the unrealized gains came from holdings in public companies, with Uber responsible for about $700 million and Ping An Good Doctor, Vir Biotechnology Inc. and Guardant Health Inc. contributing about $200 million each.

“It’s still too early to say that it will be all profits at the Vision Fund going forward,” Son said in a live-streamed briefing. “But things are turning around in a big way.”

Several SoftBank-backed companies have also pulled off successful initial public offerings, raising the prospects for more in the future. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc. more than doubled in the days after its initial public offering last month, while oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. has surged about the same amount since its trading debut.

Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage backed by SoftBank, said last week it is seeking to raise about $2 billion in a U.S. IPO. DoorDash Inc., a U.S. food delivery company backed by SoftBank, has filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and e-commerce giant Coupang are preparing for offerings in 2021.

Son confirmed that SoftBank is looking to sell or take public Arm Ltd., the chip design firm that he bought four years ago for $32 billion. He said he may accelerate plans for an Arm IPO from the original 2023 schedule or he may sell part or all of the firm. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talked to acquire Arm.

Son put plans for a second Vision Fund on hold after missteps, including the meltdown at WeWork. Now, the fund’s upbeat results and a renewed investor appetite for risk could revive the idea, according to Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group.

”Our strategy hasn’t changed,” Son said at the briefing. “We still plan on unicorn hunting with Vision Fund 2, 3 and so on.”

* Enel, E.ON, Iberdrola have accelerated tech adoption

* Relying more on software will help cut costs

By Stephen Jewkes and Christoph Steitz

MILAN/FRANKFURT, Aug 10 (Reuters) - When COVID-19 plunged Italy into lockdown, it was decision time at the Verampio power station. The control room, which runs a fleet of hydroelectric plants across the Piedmont region, hard hit by the pandemic, had to be secured to keep the lights on.

Operator Enel, Europe's largest utility, moved quickly to create a parallel backup control room at a smaller site 30 kms (18.6 miles) away while also plugging some key workers into the plant's data base so they could work from home to help keep control.

""We'd never done this sort of thing over a long period of time but it worked instantly,"" said Giuseppe Serrecchia, Enel's head of Global Power Generation Digital Hub.

""To properly respond to the challenges of COVID, we've boosted our overall digitalization drive.""

Like companies in other sectors, European utilities are having to speed up the adoption of new technologies as the coronavirus crisis forces them to use software, not people, to steer critical infrastructure including plants and grids.

Consultants say the move was overdue.

Spain's Iberdrola, the world's second-largest renewables group by capacity, has set up similar processes to Enel.

The pandemic that brought the global economy to its knees has created advantages for businesses immune to shutdowns and restrictions, allowing staff to work remotely and providing technology to keep service flowing.

""Utilities that started digital programs before the crisis have been more resilient. In the post-COVID 19 world, many will need to reconsider their technology priorities,"" McKinsey said.

""Using remote supervision could help grid operators minimize the risk for their workforces while simplifying operations,"" the consultancy said.

RESILIENCE

At Germany's E.ON, Europe's largest operator of energy networks with 1.56 million kms of power and gas grids, that message has also sunk in.

It has freed up a further 500 million euros ($591 million), on top of a total 13 billion euros it plans to invest over the next three years, mostly in upgrading its energy infrastructure.

The company has increased the use of drones by 50% and relies more on automated image recognition software for the inspection of high-voltage power lines as a direct consequence of the pandemic, officials told Reuters.

E.ON, which recently completed the takeover of Innogy's networks and retail activities, is also banking on virtual reality. At subsidiary Bayernwerk, which operates distribution grids in the German state of Bavaria, E.ON has virtually recreated substations to train staff remotely and provide access to partner firms without sending anyone.

""During the corona crisis, our employees and customers have learned to re-appreciate the advantages of digitalisation,"" E.ON CEO Johannes Teyssen said, adding the group would accelerate digitising its processes.

E.ON is also in the final stages of developing an app similar to Apple's video conferencing service FaceTime that lets technicians help customers fix their smart meters at home, unless the problem is too complex to handle from afar.

The creation and use of new technologies is a step change in running infrastructure and retail businesses more efficiently and could boost valuations, analysts and consultants say.

""It builds more resilience in your business when you can operate from multiple locations,"" said Steve Jennings, head of Energy & Utilities at PwC. ""The crisis will accelerate the digital revolution for utilities.""

DIGITAL BILLIONS

Companies are investing billions to get big data infrastructure in place that will allow them not only to manage plants and grids efficiently and fast, but also roll out new services and create new revenue streams.

They could find some help from plans the European Union has put in place to combat the COVID-19 fallout as its 7-year 1-trillion-euro budget proposal and 750 billion euro recovery plan are geared towards green and digital transitions.

Enel, the first global utility to migrate all its data to the cloud last year, has already spent 4.5 billion euros on digitalization in the last three years, and plans to invest a further 2.5 billion euros in 2020-2022.

But such drives don't come without risks as the increased need to work remotely also raises the chance of cyberattacks, Leo Simonovich, Vice President and Global Head Industrial Cyber and Digital Security at Germany's Siemens, said.

""Less-reliable internet connections, social engineering attacks against employees and their families, and honest mistakes made in unfamiliar workflows are all new potential risks.""

Utilities have little choice, however, but to plough on, concerned that they could be challenged by tech giants such as Alphabet's Google or oil majors including BP, which last week unveiled plans to enter renewables.

""If they don't do it then big data giants like Apple and Google will come in with their apps and redefine the client relationship,"" said Ingmar Wilhelm, chairman of energy big-data startup Energisme.

Top-Down Analysis

We don’t live in a world where individual stocks rise and fall on their own merits alone. They are, to one degree or another, influenced by the undercurrent of broad market trends and sector shifts. A good company in an out-of-favor sector gets penalized. Its wings are clipped by soured sentiment, limiting its ability to fly. Alternatively, a weak company in a favored sector receives a tailwind. It’s not a blessing born of good behavior. It’s a byproduct of being in the right place at the right time.

This reality is why traders should always keep an eye on the tone and trends of the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and other major indices.

The same goes for keeping tabs on sector performance. Knowing what is leading or lagging can be a huge time saver in discovering profitable opportunities as you explore the vast tundra of tickers.

The above explanation highlights the essence of top-down analysis. Moving from index to sector to stock allows for more informed decision-making and, ultimately, a higher success rate with your stock picking.

Enter NVDA Stock

The fast-growing company sits in the semiconductor industry of the technology sector. And both are on fire. With Thursday marking yet another record high, the Nasdaq Composite has now risen 67% off the March low. The epic magnitude of the rise has been matched by its consistency.

There is no denying mega-cap stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have done the heavy lifting, but the semiconductor industry has also been a growth engine for tech. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) has risen 79% from the March bottom.

After Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia is the second-largest holding. NVDA stock hasn’t been a backseat passenger during the now five-month trip. It has been driving the bus.

Beware the Asymmetric Risk vs. Reward Nvidia (NVDA) stock chart showing overbought conditions

Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade

NVDA stock is working on its eighth up day in a row. Like all momentum feedback loops, it seems the higher the stock goes, the stronger it looks. But here’s where my inner risk radar starts going off. I’m not a fan of buying something that has already risen eight days in a row. The risk/reward ratio is out of whack, where the downside starts to outweigh the remaining upside. Tack on the looming earnings report on August 19 and buyers are running out of time if they want to enter and exit a trade before the next binary event strikes.

You have two choices.

First, sit on the sidelines and wait for a better setup to form. Nvidia has developed many pullbacks along the way after reaching short-term overbought conditions. There’s no reason we won’t see something similar this go around.

Second, if you want to jump on the momentum train and bet that the eight-day rally can extend itself to a ninth, tenth or eleventh session, then at least use a tight stop so when the inevitable retracement arrives you don’t ride it back down.

514,2020-08-06T22:07:22+00:00,Son’s SoftBank Poised to Return to Profit After Big Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- After reporting record losses in May and warning the coronavirus outbreak could be as devastating as the Great Depression, SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is already poised to declare a recovery.

When it announces results next week, the Tokyo-based company is projected to report operating income of more than $1 billion for the quarter ended in June, according to analyst estimates. The Vision Fund is likely to post a profit, three months after a $17.7 billion loss on tumbling valuations for its portfolio companies.

Son, who suffered disaster on top of fiasco in the months through March, has had almost everything go his way since then. A global rally in tech shares has lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The initial public offering market has turned red-hot, boosting the prospects for his portfolio of about 90 startups. SoftBank’s shares have climbed to a two-decade high with the help of record buybacks.

“For the next few years, valuations will continue to rise and Son will look like a genius investor again,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. “Considering how much the overall stock markets have climbed recently, it’s only natural that private valuations at the Vision Fund should rise too.”

SoftBank uses a number of approaches to value its stakes in private companies, including taking cues from their latest financing rounds and the valuations of publicly traded rivals. The exact mechanism is not disclosed, which makes earnings at the Vision Fund something of a black box. But after taking massive writedowns across the board in the last fiscal year, for most portfolio companies that remain in business the only way is up.

Below are the key things that have boosted Son and SoftBank’s fortunes since March.

The Tech Rally

After a broad plunge in markets early this year with the coronavirus outbreak, tech stocks have been surging worldwide. Nasdaq, driven by the likes of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., climbed more than 30% in the second quarter.

Story continues

For SoftBank, Uber rebounded 11% last quarter after tumbling in the first quarter, and is now trading around the $33 price the Japanese company paid in early 2018. That may allow SoftBank to mark up the valuations of its other ride-hailing startups, the most significant part of its portfolio with stakes in Didi Chuxing in China, Southeast Asia’s Grab and Ola in India.

SoftBank-backed Slack Technologies Inc., the workplace-collaboration software company seen as a key beneficiary of the pandemic, climbed about 30% this year. ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co. rose about 75%. Guardant Health Inc., a cancer-detection company in which the Japanese conglomerate is the largest shareholder, added 17% last quarter.

IPO Thaw

WeWork’s implosion and Uber’s disappointing debut last year were seen as a signal the public markets were wary of the fast-growing, money-losing companies that SoftBank tends to back. But investors’ appetite for riskier equities has been rekindled, perhaps by the tech rally and central banks’ aggressive actions to fight the pandemic.

One marquee SoftBank investment is the online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc., which more than doubled since its initial public offering last month. SoftBank owns a 21.8% stake that is now worth about $750 million, more than double its investment last year. Lemonade has yet to turn profitable since its inception in 2015.

Oncology drug developer Relay Therapeutics Inc. surged more than 85% since its trading debut last month. The Vision Fund invested $300 million in Relay in 2018 and holds a 41% stake in the company. Relay had a net loss of $75 million for 2019.

The successes could pave the way for more listings from the fund, helping Son deliver on his promise of several IPOs a year. Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage, is planning an offering within a month, according to a person familiar with the matter. SoftBank in January invested $1.3 billion at a $10 billion valuation, which is likely to double in the IPO, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are public.

DoorDash Inc., a food delivery company, in February filed paperwork for a public stock listing. Online insurance platform Policybazaar and South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Corp. are also preparing for offerings in 2021.

Sell, sell, sell

Son, who was long criticized for his unwillingness to exit investments, has been on an unprecedented selling spree in the past few months. SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen in assets, including stock in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and its domestic telecom unit. The proceeds will be used to fund share repurchases and to pay down debt.

SoftBank is also selling its stake in OSIsoft LLC. Son paid close to $1 billion for a 45% stake in 2017, valuing the industrial software maker at $2 billion at the time, according to the person familiar. The company is now in talks for a sale at more than $4 billion, Bloomberg News has reported.

By far the biggest deal would be the sale of the sale of Arm Ltd., the chip designer SoftBank bought for $32 billion four years ago. Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire the company and the two parties aim to reach a deal in the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. SoftBank sold a 25% stake in Arm to the Vision Fund for $8 billion, as part of its capital contribution to the fund.

Buyback Bonanza

SoftBank shares have soared more than 140% from their March low to hit a two-decade high. The billionaire has long complained that the shares are traded at less than the value of its portfolio of investments, but this year he made his most concerted effort to narrow the gap.

Starting with March, Son announced an unprecedented string of buybacks totaling 2.5 trillion yen. SoftBank has already repurchased 1 trillion yen worth of stock as of Aug. 3. Two tranches still remain, one running until March 31 next year and another until July 30.

“The actual earnings results at the Vision Fund are less important these days, having been overshadowed by the massive share buybacks,” Jefferies’s Goyal said.

SoftBank is also selling its stake in OSIsoft LLC. Son paid close to $1 billion for a 45% stake in 2017, valuing the industrial software maker at $2 billion at the time, according to the person familiar. The company is now in talks for a sale at more than $4 billion, Bloomberg News has reported.

By far the biggest deal would be the sale of the sale of Arm Ltd., the chip designer SoftBank bought for $32 billion four years ago. Nvidia Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire the company and the two parties aim to reach a deal in the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. SoftBank sold a 25% stake in Arm to the Vision Fund for $8 billion, as part of its capital contribution to the fund.

Buyback Bonanza

SoftBank shares have soared more than 140% from their March low to hit a two-decade high. The billionaire has long complained that the shares are traded at less than the value of its portfolio of investments, but this year he made his most concerted effort to narrow the gap.

Starting with March, Son announced an unprecedented string of buybacks totaling 2.5 trillion yen. SoftBank has already repurchased 1 trillion yen worth of stock as of Aug. 3. Two tranches still remain, one running until March 31 next year and another until July 30.

“The actual earnings results at the Vision Fund are less important these days, having been overshadowed by the massive share buybacks,” Jefferies’s Goyal said.

By Noel Randewich

Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq surged to a record high close on Monday as a rebound in multibillion-dollar deals, including Microsoft's pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations, lifted sentiment, and efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed.

Microsoft jumped 5.6% after it said it would push ahead with talks to buy the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok. President Donald Trump reversed course earlier on a planned ban of the short-video app.

ADT soared over 56% on news that Alphabet's Google was buying a nearly 7% stake in the home security firm for $450 million in a deal that will allow it to provide service to customers of its Nest home security devices.

Varian Medical Systems Inc jumped 22% after a $16 billion buyout by Germany's Siemens Healthineers, while Kansas City Southern gained after a report a group of buyout investors were considering a takeover bid in a deal of about $20 billion.

""The market is revolving around M&A activity possibly picking up,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""It means CEOs are more confident about the future. Otherwise, why would they lay out billions of dollars?""

Apple Inc climbed 2.5%, expanding its rally following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. The tech giant is about $140 billion short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.

The S&P 500 information technology index jumped 2.5%, far outpacing other sector indexes.

Congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials resumed talks aimed at hammering out a coronavirus relief bill after missing a vital deadline to extend relief benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans.

Story continues

A rally in tech-related stocks and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within about 3% of February's record high.

The Labor Department's monthly employment report is due on Friday, on the heels of last week's weekly jobless claims data that showed a recovery in the job market appeared to have stalled in late July.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.89% to end at 26,664.4 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.72% to 3,294.61.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.47% to 10,902.80, beating its previous record high close on July 20.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season now past its half-way mark, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates, but the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year.

Drug distributor McKesson Corp jumped 6.5% after boosting its full-year earnings forecast.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 164 new highs and 16 new lows.

About 9.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Medha Singh

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Monday as a rebound in multi-billion dollar deals, including Microsoft's pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations, lifted sentiment as efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed.

Microsoft jumped 4% on saying it would push ahead with talks to buy the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok after President Donald Trump reversed course on a planned ban of the short-video app.

Apple Inc gained for a second straight session following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. At its current share price of about $437, the tech giant is about $132 billion - or around $30 a share - short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.

Tech far outpaced gains among the six of 11 major S&P sectors trading higher.

""Everyone realizes that tech is the place you want to be right now but from market's standpoint, breadth matters,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.

""You want to see banks, industrials do well and that's a pretty good sign of things to come if those sectors are performing.""

A rally in tech-related stocks and historic stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within 3% of its peak, but faltering macroeconomic data and a gridlock on more government stimulus have made investors cautious again.

Congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials resumed talks aimed at reaching a relief bill on Monday afternoon after missing a vital deadline last week to extend benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans.

Story continues

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Monday as a rebound in multi-billion dollar deals, including Microsoft's pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations, lifted sentiment as efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed.

Microsoft jumped 4% on saying it would push ahead with talks to buy the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok after President Donald Trump reversed course on a planned ban of the short-video app.

Apple Inc gained for a second straight session following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. At its current share price of about $437, the tech giant is about $132 billion - or around $30 a share - short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.

Tech far outpaced gains among the six of 11 major S&P sectors trading higher.

""Everyone realizes that tech is the place you want to be right now but from market's standpoint, breadth matters,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.

""You want to see banks, industrials do well and that's a pretty good sign of things to come if those sectors are performing.""

A rally in tech-related stocks and historic stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within 3% of its peak, but faltering macroeconomic data and a gridlock on more government stimulus have made investors cautious again.

Congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials resumed talks aimed at reaching a relief bill on Monday afternoon after missing a vital deadline last week to extend benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans.

* ""Project Artemis"" aims to better compete with Tesla

* New system will serve VW group, but be used at Audi first

By Edward Taylor and Jörn Poltz

INGOLSTADT, July 30 (Reuters) - Carmakers that once competed mainly over the power of their engines are now vying over a much less tangible sort of power as they race to develop automated vehicles - computing.

New Audi boss Markus Duesmann is assembling a team of about 200 engineers within parent company Volkswagen Group to develop a new computer-driven vehicle system, he told Reuters.

Dubbed ""Project Artemis"" after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, the plan is to chase down - and overtake - Tesla , widely viewed as the industry leader in software.

""When it comes to digitalisation we are lagging behind - for now,"" Duesmann said in an interview at Audi's headquarters in Ingolstadt, southern Germany.

With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicles need processors and software operating systems to analyse data from radar, lidar, and camera sensors to calculate driving reflexes so cars can navigate and avoid accidents on their own.

In the past, bigger cars with more powerful engines were automatically better. Now computing power and intelligence will be a key metric for defining what is premium, forcing Audi and Volkswagen to retool the way they design cars.

""Technical development of vehicles is no longer organised according to a vehicle's size, but by the car's electrical and electronic architecture,"" Duesmann said, explaining that premium and value models would now differentiate themselves according to their computing power and sensor levels.

To build the new system, Duesmann is assembling a ""results oriented"" engineering team to work on accelerating development of a scalable vehicle platform.

""(Project) Artemis will be smaller than a Formula One team. I am thinking around 200 staff,"" he said.

Story continues

""To develop a new car with so many new features in this period until 2024 is so demanding that it is probably without precedent. That's why we have decided to work with a separate unit,"" said Duesmann, who is also head of research at Volkswagen Group.

The idea is that an agile development group will be less encumbered by the bureaucracy within Volkswagen Group, which owns brands including Bugatti, Bentley, Porsche, Skoda, and Lamborghini, as well as Audi and VW.

VW has more than 10,000 employees working in research and development at the company's Wolfsburg headquarters alone.

Artemis will be led by Alexander Hitzinger, who was responsible for autonomous driving at Volkswagen and built up the Porsche racing team that won Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017. Hitzinger also worked at Apple, where he set up and managed product development for autonomous vehicles.

The Artemis team will harness the engineering know-how within Volkswagen Group, but also have the authority to use outside partners.

""If we gain speed with a supplier or with a software company, we will consider it. Speed is extremely important,"" Duesmann said. China will also play a role, Duesmann added, declining to elaborate.

Project Artemis will sit alongside Volkswagen Group's Car.Software organisation, also based in Ingolstadt.

""They need each other,"" Duesmann said, adding many of Artemis's staff would remain embedded within Volkswagen Group brands, but receive instructions from Ingolstadt.

528,2020-07-20T08:30:51+00:00,Chinese AirPods Maker Soars on Deal to Assemble iPhone Amid Trade Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will soon invite a mainland Chinese company into the exclusive club of global iPhone assemblers, marking the biggest change to a decade-old production model just as Washington-Beijing tensions escalate.

Luxshare Precision Industry Co. struck a deal to acquire Wistron Corp.’s iPhone unit and become the first mainland company to assemble Apple’s marquee device. It’s another win for a company that went from making cables and antennas to AirPods, sending its shares higher by as much as 7% Monday while Wistron fell up to 10%.

The introduction of a homegrown Chinese star helps Apple scores points with Beijing, at a time Washington officials have accused it of kow-towing to the Chinese government. It also shakes up Apple’s supply chain by threatening to wrest business away from longstanding partners Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Pegatron Corp. Pegatron fell almost 4% while Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, closed 1.4% lower.

“Apple is introducing Luxshare into the iPhone assembly business to further reduce its costs, while this reflects that Taiwanese companies are starting to rid of Apple businesses that are low-margin,” said Tsai Ming-fang, an industrial economist at Taipei-based Tamkang University. “This shift may further push Taiwanese companies to decamp from China as margins continue to slip as contract manufacturing becomes more standardized.”

Apple, which exerts enormous influence over major changes among its primary suppliers, has sought a mainland Chinese partner in part to broaden its production sources during a bruising U.S.-China trade war.

From Foxconn to Pegatron and Quanta Corp., the mainly Taiwanese contract manufacturers to the world’s biggest electronics brands are exploring ways to shift production away from China -- averting rising tariffs -- and move up the value chain. Assembling iPhones requires hundreds of thousands of workers, often culled from a volatile and constantly shifting pool of migrant labor, eating into margins.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Luxshare’s announced acquisition of two factories from Wistron in China may give it scope to win iPhone assembly orders beginning in 2023, based on our scenario analysis. This would hit Pegatron hard and possibly shave 3-4% off its sales, while Hon Hai’s diversity will better insulate it from the blow, we believe.

Wistron may have been struggling to compete. Its Kunshan plant -- which makes mostly iPhones -- managed a net profit margin of just 0.2% in 2019, Nomura analysts noted in a July 17 note. The Taiwanese company accounted for only roughly 5% of total iPhone assembly orders, they said.

Luxshare, in contrast, is among the largest of a crop of fast-rising Chinese electronics houses increasingly winning orders from established firms like Hon Hai. It’s become the world’s biggest maker of AirPods -- one of the fastest-selling consumer accessories in the market -- helping it record one of Asia’s best stock performances in 2019.

The company agreed to pay about 3.3 billion yuan ($470 million) for two Wistron subsidiaries in eastern China. One of those units, based in the city of Kunshan, is Wistron’s sole iPhone manufacturing site, according to people familiar with the company’s business. The deal is slated for completion by year’s end pending regulatory approval. On Monday, CICC lifted its target price on Luxshare by about 16%.

Luxshare’s deal “may now give it the scope to push on to gain share of iPhone assembly,” BI’s Kanterman and Naidu wrote. “It’s likely that Apple will support its partner and provide it with allocations over time, as the iPhone maker likely wants to further diversify its supply chain beyond just two main partners.”

Taiwan-based Wistron, one of just three contract manufacturers that assemble Apple’s iPhones, said Friday it’s agreed to sell two subsidiaries in eastern China for 3.3 billion yuan to Luxshare. One of those units, based in the city of Kunshan, is Wistron’s sole iPhone manufacturing site, according to people familiar with the company’s business.

Apple in turn has sought a mainland Chinese partner in part to broaden local sources during a trade war.

A Wistron representative said the Kunshan site being sold to Luxshare makes smartphones, notebooks and connected devices, and the company will shift production of some of those products elsewhere in China. She declined to comment on the its iPhone business. An Apple representative didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Luxshare and other contract manufacturers have long sought to compete in assembling Apple’s most profitable device. Wistron is the smallest of three iPhone assemblers, lagging behind Pegatron Corp. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the company also known as Foxconn. Wistron continues to assemble cheaper iPhones in India.

“With the acquisition of the Wistron’s iPhone unit, Luxshare can now become an iPhone assembler,” GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said. “This will first pose a threat to Pegatron’s iPhone business in China.”

532,2020-07-16T07:17:28+00:00,Top China Chipmaker SMIC More than Triples in Shanghai Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. surged more than 200% during its Shanghai debut following a stock offering that is set to be China’s largest in a decade.

The Shanghai-based chipmaker climbed to 82.92 yuan on its first day of trading in the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s STAR market after initially selling shares at 27.46 yuan apiece. SMIC will raise as much as 53.2 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) if it fully exercises a greenshoe option, which would make it the largest mainland stock sale since Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s 68.5 billion yuan Shanghai initial public offering in 2010.

SMIC’s mainland listing comes amid intensifying competition between the U.S. and China for global tech supremacy. As the country’s No.1 contract manufacturer of chipsets, SMIC plays an important role in Beijing’s ambitions of becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production following efforts by the Trump administration to curtail access by Chinese companies to key components.

Proceeds from the share sale will be used to develop next-generation chipmaking technologies as SMIC seeks to catch up to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.’s most advanced smartphone models. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is ready to commercialize 5 nanometer technology, two generations ahead of SMIC’s capabilities.

China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC Pte and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are among institutional investors that participated in SMIC’s share offering.

SMIC’s shares in Hong Kong fell 22% Thursday, the biggest drop since its listing in 2004. Those shares had tripled this year in anticipation of the Shanghai listing.

“SMIC has surged multiple times over a short period of time,” Kenny Wen, strategist with Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co., said by phone. “We see investors rush to profit-taking once the listing is completed.”

533,2020-07-16T07:17:28+00:00,Top China Chipmaker SMIC More than Triples in Shanghai Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. surged more than 200% during its Shanghai debut following a stock offering that is set to be China’s largest in a decade.

The Shanghai-based chipmaker climbed to 82.92 yuan on its first day of trading in the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s STAR market after initially selling shares at 27.46 yuan apiece. SMIC will raise as much as 53.2 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) if it fully exercises a greenshoe option, which would make it the largest mainland stock sale since Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s 68.5 billion yuan Shanghai initial public offering in 2010.

SMIC’s mainland listing comes amid intensifying competition between the U.S. and China for global tech supremacy. As the country’s No.1 contract manufacturer of chipsets, SMIC plays an important role in Beijing’s ambitions of becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production following efforts by the Trump administration to curtail access by Chinese companies to key components.

Proceeds from the share sale will be used to develop next-generation chipmaking technologies as SMIC seeks to catch up to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.’s most advanced smartphone models. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is ready to commercialize 5 nanometer technology, two generations ahead of SMIC’s capabilities.

China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC Pte and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are among institutional investors that participated in SMIC’s share offering.

SMIC’s shares in Hong Kong fell 22% Thursday, the biggest drop since its listing in 2004. Those shares had tripled this year in anticipation of the Shanghai listing.

“SMIC has surged multiple times over a short period of time,” Kenny Wen, strategist with Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co., said by phone. “We see investors rush to profit-taking once the listing is completed.”

534,2020-07-16T03:09:06+00:00,Apple Supplier JDI Surges as CEO Reveals Mobile OLED Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan Display Inc., the struggling supplier of screens to Apple Inc., says it is in talks with customers on possible joint investments in next-generation organic light-emitting diode displays. Shares of JDI posted their biggest gain in 19 months.

JDI is developing a technology that will deliver OLED screens that are sharper, less power hungry and are easier to produce, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Minoru Kikuoka said in an interview. While JDI is a few technical milestones short of deciding whether to push ahead, it has already started talks with some customers on investing in the new technology, Kikuoka said, declining to name specific companies.

The launch of Apple’s first OLED iPhone in 2017 was seen as the beginning of the end for the long reign of liquid crystal displays - a dire threat for JDI because that is its core business. The company relies on Apple for about 60% of its revenue was falling behind in technology and lacked the funds needed to ramp up production. But forecasts of LCD’s demise missed the mark, giving JDI the breathing room to develop a smaller OLED for use in the Apple Watch. It is now considering entry into the smartphone market, a move which will pit it against Samsung Electronics Co. and Chinese manufacturers.

“We have no intention of getting into a capex war with rivals,” Kikuoka said. “There is already tremendous interest in partnering with us on commercialization.”

The shares surged as much as 37.5% to 66 yen, the biggest intraday gain since December 2018. They were at 62 yen at the midday break in Tokyo. Thursday morning’s gains helped recoup some of the 40% in market value JDI had shed this year.

JDI intends to use a different manufacturing technology than the evaporation method used by rivals, Kikuoka said. Whether to advance to mass production will depend on its ability to raise output yields and customer needs at the time. He estimated that the company could commence full-scale manufacturing in Japan or abroad as early as 2022.

Story continues

Constituted from the remains of numerous ailing Japanese display makers in 2012, JDI mistimed large investments in LCD capacity and found itself struggling against abler competition from South Korean and Chinese rivals. Six straight years of losses have sent it in search of a capital infusion from overseas, but the list of potential suitors continued to dwindle. When Kikuoka took the helm in September, the company had just reached a new low, warning that if it’s not able to raise fresh capital it may face difficulties continuing its business.

Since then, it secured a lifeline that included about 50 billion yen ($466 million) raised from Ichigo Trust and a refinancing scheme by Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a state-owned fund that remains JDI’s largest shareholders. Apple has also pitched in by buying some of its manufacturing equipment.

While the threat of insolvency has lifted, the company is still struggling to return to profit. It booked a 38.5 billion yen operating loss in the year ended March, after sales plunged 21%. JDI forecast sales will decline as much as 20% this fiscal year, citing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and slump in demand for screens in smartphones and cars.

The industry’s looming shift to OLED is another factor weighing on its shares, which trade at less than a tenth the level when it listed in 2014. While Apple’s 2019 phone lineup included one LCD model and another was added in the first half of this year, the expectations are building that this year will mark a complete shift to OLED. Still, Kikuoka says the alarm is unwarranted.

“It is more than a customer-supplier relationship, more akin to that of a co-developer supplier,” he said. “I don’t see our relationship diminishing.”

536,2020-07-15T19:15:48+00:00,"To support these valuations, we need to see a 'follow-through' in earnings expectations: Strategist","Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab Jeffrey Kleintop joins Yahoo Finance's Kristin Myers to discuss the latest market action amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: --Sachs, as I had mentioned, out with a good earnings report today. They actually had beat on the both top and bottom lines. That stock right now up just over 1%, so paring some of the gains they had a little bit earlier today.

When you're looking at today, right now, energy, industrials, and financials are all leading today. Tech starting to flip into the green right now. Microsoft still in the red. However, Apple and Facebook-- Facebook a little bit flat right now, but Apple now in the green, up about 3/10 of a percentage point.

And on the coronavirus front, as I just mentioned, Moderna coming out some positive news when it comes to that vaccine. But they're not the only ones. AstraZeneca also announcing that they would be having some good news to share with us on the vaccine front as early potentially as tomorrow. That would be Thursday.

Current case count right now nearing 3.5 million, which means we leapfrogged past that 3.4 million number. If you guys remember yesterday, it was just under 3.4 million. Now steadily approaching that 3.5 million number. New York state, sad news here, has now surpassed 25,000 deaths due to COVID-19. And in Oklahoma, Governor Kevin Stitt says that he has actually tested positive for coronavirus.

Now, as I mentioned, markets had been popping a little bit more earlier today on that positive vaccine news out from Moderna and AstraZeneca. Goldman Sachs, also as I mentioned, out with some positive earnings. So for more on what we're seeing in the markets today, we're joined now by Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab. Thanks for joining us, Jeff.

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Thanks for having me on.

KRISTIN MYERS: So in a recent blog that I had been reading, you had written, quote, in these uncertain times, it may be comforting to know that the markets are making some sense. So where are markets making sense in your mind? And where does the confusion still remain?

Story continues

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, you know, one of the things that's important is the biggest driver for stocks over the long term are earnings. But even in the near term, stocks and the direction of earnings estimates should be lining up. And although we are seeing a bit of an uptick here in the last month or so in earnings estimates, the actual level, the number, it's a guess at this point.

But the fact that we're seeing more analysts raise the-- raise their numbers for companies then cut them is important. And that's something the stock market has been tracking really all year. As analysts were cutting estimates, stocks were falling. And now as we're seeing a larger and larger number of companies seeing upward estimates, stocks have been tracking that.

And that's really important. As we go through the earnings season here, I think we're going to see more of this. You're going to hear more of these results, exceeding expectations. About 80% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far-- I know it's early-- but they have exceeded expectations.

And what we've seen in recent business surveys around the world-- Australia, France, Germany, the US-- is an uptick in business leader confidence. And that may translate into better guidance and the continuation of this trend of upward earnings estimates. So that's a positive for the markets.

Where I'm seeing a disconnect, just to jump to that, is in the expectations for dividends. The financial sector is a great example. We got some results this morning. We'll get more this week.

Analysts are more optimistic on the return of dividends later this year, both for US and international financial services companies. Not true in the markets. If we look at dividend futures, markets are still expecting those dividends to basically remain at the levels they are now post-COVID all through next year.

So there's a potential there for an upward revision to dividend expectations, which could provide further upside to the financial sector, one of the areas leading today.

KRISTIN MYERS: So Jeffrey, I want to ask you about that guidance point, especially as we're looking out a little bit further into Q3, Q4, and even into 2021. As you're mentioning, analysts really downbeat on this quarter when it comes to earnings. Do you see a revision in the future, more optimism there, raising the bar that some of these companies are going to have to beat in future earning-- future earnings reports for coming quarters?

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Yeah, it's true that the bar may go up a little bit here. And companies-- yeah, it's a little bit harder. But look, the market's hardly raised that bar. We've seen such a rebound in the stock market. We need to see that follow through in terms of earnings expectations to support these valuations.

Yeah, down the road, third quarter, fourth quarter, companies are going to come up on those hurdles that may be a bit higher. And they're going to have to clear them. And so that could be a challenge down the road and lead to more of-- maybe more volatility in the markets later this year.

But for now, to support this upside move, we continue to see these upward revisions. So in the near term, that's good news. It does create a higher hurdle down the road.

KRISTIN MYERS: So on the vaccine front, as I had been mentioning, we got some positive news out from Moderna, AstraZeneca. We've heard a lot of positive news from Gilead, BioNTech, Regeneron. The list kind of seems to be going on.

And I feel like we're in this environment that we were in before when it came to the US-China trade deal. It almost feels as if we are in this binary moment, a will they, won't they when it comes to the vaccine. So, I mean, how do investors manage on just trading on whether we are going to get a vaccine or we are not going to be getting a vaccine?

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Right, there will certainly be a big difference. A vaccine is an important accelerator of economic activity. So it's understandable the market's reacting in such a bifurcated way, I mean, especially where the number of cases continue to climb, like in the US and in Brazil and in India.

It would also be a welcome relief for lagging industries, like the airlines and hotels and restaurants. We're still seeing pretty soft things like weekend box office revenue. Even though movie theaters are now open in much of Europe and Asia, even where the virus has been defeated, like Japan or Korea or France, people aren't really returning to movie theaters or flying on airplanes, for example. So a vaccine could see a sharper service sector recovery and really lift the stocks in some of those areas.

But the good news is a recovery is still underway, even without a vaccine. And this is what investors should focus on. Business surveys, as I mentioned, in the past week in France, in Germany, Australia, other places, do reflect the V-shaped recovery in at least business leader confidence. And that's important as we look to the future for the labor market, which is so critical to our consumer-driven economy.

KRISTIN MYERS: So I want to ask you about tech right now. As I mentioned, tech wasn't doing so well today, although we have now seen some bigger FAANG stocks flipping into the green. Now anyone that read the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief-- I want to give a shout out there to Myles Udland and Sam Ro-- they were talking about investor worries about betting big on tech.

So I'm wondering, Jeffrey, in your mind, how much risk is there in the high weighting of tech stocks right now? And in the brief, I kind of want to quote here that they noted a net 42% of investors are overweight technology stocks, the highest of any sector.

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: It's easy to let your portfolio drift into that position. I do think that's a risk. We are not overweight the technology sector. We were for many, many, many years. And we have taken that down.

We're now overweight financials. Here's an area where probably most investors are underweight in their portfolio. After many years of disappointing performance, we think there's a rotation taking place from growth to value. And we're seeing this show up even in day like today, where again, financials are outperforming the tech sector and they have for the last couple of months.

This is not just a theme in the near term. We think it will unfold through this entire economic cycle. So it's important for investors to get ahead of this and rebalance their portfolios back to a more balanced representation across growth sectors, like tech, and value ones, like financials.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, we'll have to leave that there.

537,2020-07-14T05:47:25+00:00,India's Digital Future Means a Google Search,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a long time, U.S.-based internet giants entertained the idea of finally accessing the world’s biggest market and tapping into a base of more than 1.3 billion potential consumers. Now, just as the door to China appears firmly shut, the next giant market is opening up.

Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai is ready to realize India’s potential with the one way executives know best: a big fat check. The American search-engine giant said its Google unit plans to spend $10 billion over the next seven years on operations, infrastructure and investments as a “reflection of our confidence in the future of India and its digital economy.”

American corporate leaders from Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos to Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg have all known that India could be the next big thing. Pichai, himself Indian-born, hasn’t sat idly by, either.

Their entry has been slowed by lack of broad-based demand for services offered only in English, a national market fragmented by whimsical local taxation, and an inadequate road and warehousing network that would facilitate quick e-commerce logistics.Favorable Chinese treatment, and protectionism, allowed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to develop super-apps that deliver a smorgasbord of offerings from instant messaging to news and deliveries to financial services. No U.S. giant offers anywhere near the breadth and depth of services as their Chinese counterparts.

Indian oil billionaire Mukesh Ambani has designs on doing in his home country just what the Americans couldn’t do in theirs.

Four years ago, he upended the telecommunications sector with a new entrant that offered free voice calls and really cheap data. Suddenly, hundreds of millions more Indian consumers had a mobile phone in their hands and a reliable, affordable internet connection. Ambani followed that up by getting Facebook to buy a 10% percent stake in Jio Platforms Ltd. — Ambani’s holding company for telcos, media and other digital assets — for $5.7 billion.

Story continues

With Facebook now owning a stake in Jio, it makes sense for Google to look for its own telco dance partner, be it Bharti Airtel Ltd. or Vodafone Idea Ltd. — the only two meaningful competitors to Jio’s wireless service that are still left in the fray.

Google’s big move is well-timed. The nation’s largely state-owned banking system was in bad shape even before Covid-19. After the inevitable pandemic-linked losses, institutions will be grateful to limp again and digital commerce will present a new growth avenue. When Indian consumers need loans, they’ll be giving consent to lenders to digitally piece together their credit history by pulling scraps from everywhere. Suppliers of goods and services will also want to tap cheaper working capital by sharing a real-time snapshot of their cash flows.

Indian banks are at a disadvantage in the coming shakeup. Information collection, analysis and distribution is exactly what the U.S. internet companies do best. Jio with Facebook, Google (with or without a chosen partner), and even Amazon.com could have deeper insights into consumer and supplier habits than the traditional financiers. A Jio or Google-backed finance app could dish out a loan faster than a banker could pull out a ballpoint pen. That would leave the state-owned lenders offering little more than their vast balance sheets for credit creation.

Not only is India finally getting the fast mobile coverage it sorely needs, its payments infrastructure is also ready. Pichai has built a payments service specifically for India, using the local platform that allows any two parties, holding accounts at different banks, to send and receive money instantly without knowing anything more than each others’ virtual IDs. The revamped network is so modern and innovation-friendly that Google has asked the U.S. to consider emulating it.

Jio has garnered much of the recent attention, helped by a splashy fundraising spectacle that adds up to half of the investment in global telecom deals this year. But Google’s payment app as well as WalMart’s PhonePe have been quietly scaling up. Now, when Indian consumers want deliveries, entertainment, or a loan there’s a good chance they’ll be searching Google.

539,2020-07-11T00:00:14+00:00,Homes Can Shelter India’s China Dream After Covid,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- India quite literally needs to put a roof over its China dream.

It took a pandemic and a lockdown to highlight the precarious existence of the country’s blue-collar workers. Left without jobs and shelter, an estimated 30 million — roughly a fifth of the urban labor force — have gone back to their villages, with many completing long, hazardous journeys on foot when trains and buses shut down.

No wonder, then, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government cleared a plan this week to build inexpensive rental dwellings in cities for 350,000 workers.

Giving rural migrants an incentive to return is crucial to restoring economic activity to pre-Covid levels. But there’s an opportunity here to do much more. For India to industrialize, rethinking the housing situation will be as important as freeing the urban poor from large medical bills and helping them build retirement savings. If the country of 1.3 billion people wants to be a factory to the world — the next China — it must start by giving workers low-cost living quarters.

India is sitting on an inventory of more than 1.3 million unsold homes. Mumbai-based property researcher Liases Foras estimates that roughly half of these units could face delays and other execution risk; prices on nearly nine out of 10 apartments may have to be cut by 5% to 15% to hook wary buyers. That’s billions of dollars in lost revenue.

It may not be possible to repurpose this stock as worker accommodation. Nevertheless, as losses on pricey condominiums crystallize for struggling developers and stretched financiers, they can be made more bearable by tax breaks, cheap government land and other fiscal support for affordable rental housing — a new revenue stream. Assured of a decent rental yield, investors will be encouraged to finance this new asset class. Institutional capital will return to depressed real estate. Construction will absorb surplus manpower and create badly needed wage income.

Cheap urban rents will bring India the full benefit of labor mobility, which isn’t constrained by Chinese-style hukou, or city registration requirements. Yet the rapid urbanization that turned East Asia into an exporting powerhouse and created a foundation for mass consumption has eluded the country. Young men migrate to cities for economic reasons, and return to their villages in old age. Apart from cultural factors, availability and cost of housing is the main reason why women and children stay behind, making urbanization in India both slow and rather “masculine,” as economist Chinmay Tumbe, who has studied migration trends since the 1870s, has put it.

While the gender ratio of large cities is no longer as skewed as it was in the early 20th century — 500 to 600 women for 1,000 men — it’s still a lopsided 868 in Delhi. For Surat, a major diamond-cutting and textile center on India’s western coast, the ratio is even more unbalanced at 756. Surat is still an exception in that it has a lot of manufacturing. A peculiar facet of rural-urban migration in India, according to Tumbe, is that most of the workers end up in service-industry jobs.

Creaky infrastructure, infuriating red tape, occasionally overvalued currency and lack of meaningful free-trade arrangements have held back the share of manufacturing in the economy to 16% — a modest rise from 5% in 1901. Back then, British colonialists had kept India under-industrialized so they could sell their wares in a market that produced little of its own. Now, it’s a small urban elite — whose own ancestors left villages a long time ago — that’s keeping new migrants employed as chauffeurs, housemaids, condominium security and ATM guards.

The economy is geared to satisfy the top 150 million earners, as Rathin Roy, until recently the director at the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, has argued. This depresses the wages that would be generated by becoming good at making what the next 300 million want. In the absence of broad-based income growth, consumers boosted spending by borrowing. When they eventually started to deleverage last year, India faced an acute demand funk, even for 7-cent munchies.

Since then, Covid-19 hasn’t been the only wake-up call. Rapidly deteriorating U.S.-China relations portend sweeping changes in global supply chains, but even in its own neighborhood, India isn’t competitive in manufacturing. A once-in-a-generation opportunity could slip out of its grasp.

At a furniture store in Ho Chi Minh City some years ago, I saw colorful satin-upholstered sofas whose sides were drab black polyester. This, I was told, was because the sides would take dirt from motorbike tires and must be easy to clean: A Vietnamese family would park the two-wheeler, its most precious possession, next to the living-room furniture to keep it safe at night. Societies that value and make things that workers themselves use lift living standards and labor productivity. No wonder Vietnam, now a hub for Samsung Electronics Co., is winning investments from Inventec Corp., Apple Inc.’s main assembly partner for AirPods, as well as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn.

India must also make more shoes, clothes and toys. To create a permanent urban workforce that will both produce and consume those wage goods, it should also build millions of new homes.

544,2020-07-07T08:23:24+00:00,Samsung’s Profit Beat May Precede Slowing Chip Sales Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s shares slid nearly 3% on concerns that growth in chip demand may slow as the world emerges from Covid-19 in the second half of the year, outweighing a better-than-expected profit.

The world’s largest manufacturer of memory chips and smartphones posted operating profit of 8.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion) in the three months ended June, beating the 6.2 trillion won average of estimates. Sales for the quarter were 52 trillion won, according to preliminary results released Tuesday. The company didn’t provide net income or break out divisional performance, which it will do later this month when it releases final results.

The estimates include a one-time gain related to the display business. While the company didn’t offer details, some analysts estimated it could have recorded more than 1 trillion won in compensation from Apple Inc. for fewer-than-promised display orders.

Despite its strong topline numbers, Samsung shares closed 2.9% down in Seoul on Tuesday, faring worse than the 1.1% drop in the KOSPI. Part of the negative sentiment may be explained by worries of a price decline in the key memory segment, where stockpiling orders in the current period might taper off.

“The market is concerned about a potential slowdown in server expansions. Memory prices could be weakening in the 2H,” said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

The Covid-19 pandemic has presented a silver lining for the tech industry in hastening the shift toward online activity such as video conferencing, web-based education and entertainment streaming, helping Samsung sell more chips in the quarter.

“Because of this work-from-home situation, there’s been strong demand for a couple of its products,” said Kiranjeet Kaur, a research manager at IDC. “The demand for DRAM has seen a spike in Q2 due to demand in server and data centers.”

​Although Samsung had warned of a profit slide in the second quarter due to plant and store closings, it managed to mitigate the fallout by cutting marketing expenses and selling TVs and monitors to people spending more time working and playing at home.

Samsung’s mobile and consumer electronics businesses took a hit from the closures since mid-March, but stores and factories began reopening across North America and Europe from June. Hana Financial Investment forecasts Samsung will report around 5.5 million smartphone shipments for the second quarter when it releases its full breakdown.

While Samsung’s business appears to be weathering the virus storm, the company has another significant challenge to deal with in determining the fate of its de-facto leader, Jay Y. Lee. The company’s vice chairman is facing allegations of corruption in Korea that could lead to prosecution and a return to prison.

Foxconn's customs clearance for cargo logistics in India has been resolved and all local regulatory procedures have been complied with, Foxconn said in a filing to Taipei stock exchange. It did not elaborate.

Customs officers at Indian ports have held back shipments from China and sought additional clearances after deadly clashes at the disputed Himalayan border last month.

Looking at the stock market today, the first thought that comes to mind is that it is divorced from economic reality. The S&P 500 is only a few percent away from where it started 2020.

SPY 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of SPY Peter Lynch Chart of SPY

On the surface it looks like stocks discount one incredibly rosy version of the future. In that version everything goes back to normal like nothing happened; we basically just entered and quickly exited a sharp recession and earnings came back to pre-coronavirus normal. Though that is a possible outcome, it is not a probable one, judging by what is happening right now. We'd like to note that, in any scenario, we'll exit with close to $10 trillion of additional debt on the government's and the Fed's balance sheets

I used the word discount. To discount something you bring future earnings (cash flows) at a discount rate to today's dollars. The Federal Reserve bought trillions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds of suspect quality through ETFs, taking interest rates to almost zero. This act has pushed the discount rate lower and wound up the spring of the music box in the Fed's game of musical chairs. So the market behavior to a large degree reflects not the sum of future scenarios but the much lower discount rate by which these scenarios are discounted.

Since the Fed is buying, the music is playing, and investors keep dancing (speculating). Greed is back. It seems that this music just keeps on playing.

But will it?

The economy is a very complex organic system created by trillions of individual transactions. The Fed's involvement introduces inorganic matter into the ecosystem that slowly poisons and atrophies the system. The Fed's active involvement distorts price signaling (higher prices lead to higher demand and vice versa) as it manipulates the price of the most fundamental commodity in the system - interest rates (the price of money).

Story continues

The Fed's buying junk bonds through ETFs has brought us closer to a Walking Dead economy. It has given a further lease on life to mostly dead companies that otherwise would have perished. But it's easy for me to sit here and criticize. If I ran the Fed in March 2020, I probably would have done the same thing - the possible cost of doing nothing would have been a global depression. The bottom line is that the Fed temporarily stimulated a humongous amount of greed in a system that was shaking in fear.

We are not investing in the economy we'd like to have, but in the one we have. However, this dance cannot go on forever or at some point the Fed will own all financial assets and the U.S. economy will turn into a Potemkin village. This is why, though it has been unfashionable and even counterproductive lately, we'll keep sticking to buying great, undervalued companies, not just great companies irrespective of price.

Nifty FANGAM

While you are pondering on this, here is another observation.

If you look deeper under the hood of the stock market, you'll see that there is a significant dichotomy between bytes stocks and atoms stocks. The atoms are losing to the bytes, badly. If you compare performance of the S&P 500 (SPY) traditional market-capitalization index - the one you see in the news - to its less-known cousin, the S&P 500 equal-weighted (RSP), you'll see a significant disparity in performance.

In the market cap-weighted version, the top five stocks (all five are members of FANGAM gang - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) now represent 21% of the capitalization of the index (the last time this happened was 1999) and thus account for 21% of the returns. In RSP these stocks have a weight of 1% (they're just 5 out of 500 stocks).

SPY is down 6% for the year, where RSP is down 16% - remember, same stocks, it's just that SPY is heavily weighted toward bytes stocks, as they have larger market caps, and RSP treats bytes and atoms equally. The virus has been much kinder to bytes than atoms stocks; it has benefitted those companies as our world has become a bit more virtual and atoms were impacted by social distancing. The problem is, bytes were very expensive going into the coronavirus crisis, and they just got even more pricey (unless their businesses have improved to a greater degree than their stocks prices appreciated, which is possible but unlikely, with the possible exception of Amazon).

Just as any propaganda needs a certain germ of truth to grow from, so do bubbles. The FANGAM are incredible companies (germ of truth), and they function better in the virus-infested world (another germ of truth). But at the core, their existence is grounded in the world that is built of atoms, not bytes.

For instance, Google's advertising business will continue to take market share from non-digital forms of advertisement (not sure if any are left), but atom-based companies are the largest source of Google's advertising revenue. If the atom world is not doing well, neither will Google. Also, the law of large numbers usually kicks in at some point: A company cannot grow at supernormal rates forever or it will become bigger than the market it is serving.

The Nifty Fifty stocks come to mind here. Those were the fifty stocks - the who's who of the 1960s -that made America great (then): Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG) ... the list goes on. Though today we look at some of them as has-beens, in the '60s and '70s the world was their oyster. Coke and McDonald's were spring chickens then, spreading the American health values of diabetes and cholesterol (okay, maybe I'm being too hard on them) across this awesome planet.

Although it was hard to imagine in the '70s that any of these companies would not shine forever, they are a useful reminder that even great companies get disrupted. Avon (AVP), Kodak (KODK), Polaroid, GE (GE), Xerox (XRX) -all were Nifty Fifties, and all either went bankrupt or are heading towards irrelevancy.

In the 1960s and early 1970s these stocks were one-rule stock - and the rule was, buy! They were bought, and bought, and bought. They were great companies and paying attention to how much you paid for them was irrelevant.

Until.

The Nifty FANGAM is arguably not as expensive as the Nifty Fifty was in 1972. Lawrence Hamtil put this nice table together, using data gathered by The Brooklyn Investor blog, which divides the Nifty Fifty stocks into two groups. The cheap basket traded at around 28 times earnings and the expensive basket at about 60 or so. Neither the cheap nor the expensive basket did well in the decade of the '70s. Today, FANGAM stocks in general trade closer to the cheap basket's valuation.

If you bought and held Coke or McDonald's in 1972 (or any other Nifty Fifty stock), then you experienced a painful decade of no returns; in fact, at times you were down 50% or more. Coca Cola was as great a company in 1974 as it was in 1972, but the stock was down 50% from its high. Okay, Coca Cola was trading at 47 times earnings in 1972. But even a company like Procter & Gamble that was trading at ""only"" 32 times earnings in 1972 was down almost 50% in 1974 from its 1972 high. It took until the early 80s - a decade - until investors who bought Nifty Fifties at the top broke even - and this applies to almost all of them.

Nifty Fifty (1970's)

In today's far less patient world, that decade might as well be infinity.

As I am writing this I am struggling with a few issues. First, interest rates and inflation were much higher in the '70s and early '80s. Now, interest rates are at zero, going to negative or to ... no idea what level. Globalization was deflationary, thus de-globalization will likely be inflationary; but automation may dampen the inflationary impact, at least some of it. If we get negative rates, then on one hand they should boost stocks' price-to-earnings ratio. (Paradoxically, the further a company's cash flow is in the future, the more it is worth in today's dollars. Yes, makes little sense to us, either). On the other hand, if we have negative rates, that means we are desperate and thus earnings are collapsing.

In an inflationary environment, most earnings growth will be eaten away by declining price-to-earnings, as it happened in the '70s.

Another issue: If you held many Nifty Fifties for 20 years, from 1972 to 1992, they would have delivered a decent (10%-plus) return. This sounds great in theory; however, most people would have run out of patience after a decade of no or negative returns and thus not have been around for the fruits of the '80s decade. In other words, shareholders who bought the stocks in 1970 were not the ones who benefitted from the returns in the late '80s.

Today the Nifty FANGAM has turned into one-rule stocks - buy! (irrespective of price). If you did not own them over the last decade, your portfolio had an enormous headwind against it.

But what the Nifty Fifties showed us is that company greatness and past growth are not enough. Starting valuation - what you actually pay for the business -matters. The great companies will still be great when their stocks are down a bunch and they have a decade of no returns. Dividends aside, stock returns in the long run are not just driven by earnings growth but by what the price-to-earnings does as well. If price-to-earnings is high, it's mean reverts - declines - chipping away at the return you receive from earnings growth. I (this is Vitaliy) wrote two books on this topic.

The '70s were almost fifty years ago. Fine, just look up Microsoft, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Coca Cola, and Wal-Mart (WMT) stock charts from the late '90s, and you'll see that history repeats itself, again and again (see charts below).

What you pay for even a great company matters. Paraphrasing the great Freddie Mercury, there must be more to the stock market than FANGAM (though that has not been the case lately). They were the tailwind for the S&P 500, but they'll likely turn into a headwind over the next decade, and become an anchor around its neck.

I am not a journalist or reporter; I am an investor who thinks through writing. This and other investment articles are just my thinking at the point they were written. However, investment research is not static, it is fluid. New information comes our way and we continue to do research, which may lead us to tweak and modify assumptions and thus to change our minds.

We are long-term investors and often hold stocks for years, but as luck may or may not have it, by the time you read this article we may have already sold the stock. I may or may not write about this company ever again. Think of this and other articles as learning and thinking frameworks. But they are not investment recommendations. The bottom line is this. If this article piques your interest in the company I've mentioned, great. This should be the beginning, not the end, of your research.

548,2020-07-02T13:29:48+00:00,7 Risky Penny Stocks (That Could Really Pay Off),"No matter how often someone tries to frame the subject, penny stocks are inherently risky. As the name suggests, these speculative investments are typically priced below a buck (although this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule). More importantly, they feature low volume and subterranean market capitalization due to their all-or-nothing nature.

With the broader markets still under pressure due to the novel coronavirus, you’d assume the case for penny stocks would have died down. And in many cases, that’s exactly what happened. As valuations for virtually every sector declined at the onset of the global crisis, many gamblers took their money and ran.

But as major U.S. indices have trekked their way northward following their March lows, penny stocks have also attracted attention. For one thing, the down and dirty side of this investing business may run on their own fundamentals. That could be advantageous in some respects, especially as rising coronavirus cases wreak havoc on blue-chip organizations.

Moreover, innovation never ceases. Right now, with both advancing technologies and their associated cost reductions, it has never been easier for startups to pioneer solutions. But to raise capital, they’ve got to go somewhere. Those organizations that may not attract the most attention often turn to over-the-counter markets to gain cash.

7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends

Thus, we have the opportunity in penny stocks, but also the pitfalls. You could be sitting on the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Or you could lose your shirt like Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY) speculators possibly did. If you’re willing to take such extreme binary bets, here are seven companies to consider:

Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Champignon Brands (OTCMKTS:SHRMF) Revive Therapeutics (OTCMKTS:RVVTF) American Lithium (OTCMKTS:LIACF) Fosterville South Exploration (OTCMKTS:FSXLF) United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) BIGG Digital Assets (OTCMKTS:BBKCF)

As I mentioned up top, this is an extremely treacherous segment to navigate. Therefore, my recommendation is to treat this as a casino. Have fun with these seven penny stocks but do not go overboard.

Penny Stocks That Could Pay Off: Blink Charging (BLNK) Penny Stocks That Could Pay Off: Blink Charging (BLNK)

Source: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com

By pricing alone, Blink Charging wouldn’t typically qualify in a list of “pure” penny stocks. But given that the price is under $5 at the time of this writing, I’ll give Blink a pass. In addition, I want to lead with BLNK stock simply because it offers the most credible opportunity out of the speculative gambles here.

After all, you’ve heard of electric vehicle companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and more recently Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). Clearly, the EV market is gaining ground against the mainstream combustion-engine paradigm. But the big question is, who will “fuel” a potential surge of EVs on the road? Blink answers that question with its network of charging stations.

Sure, most EV owners will presumably charge their vehicles at home. However, not everyone in the U.S. has access to a garage or carport. Therefore, a fully fleshed out charging network would help EV makers expand its potential revenue pool. In turn, that should drive up BLNK stock.

Plus, Blink is one of the most forward-thinking organizations. For instance, it recently announced its mobile charger platform for emergency use. This way, drivers can get that extra bit of juice to reach their homes or a nearby charging station. And that reduces anxiety for consumers who have never tried EVs, making BLNK a compelling idea.

Over the years, we’ve seen a dramatic shift in how Americans view marijuana laws. According to the Pew Research Center, two-thirds of us support full legalization. Given this dramatic turnaround, it’s possible that penny stocks which are levered to alternative psychedelic medicines could rise higher in the future. One possible candidate is Champignon Brands.

And no, that wasn’t a typo — I did mean psychedelics, as in the kind that truly gets you high. Of course, as a controlled substance, governments everywhere would impose all kinds of strict restrictions. But the irony here is that restrictions are what would ultimately benefit SHRMF stock. As we know today, part of the collapse of the legal cannabis market was the influx of competition.

With psychedelics, you’ve got to have the proper license to engage this sector. Immediately, that puts up a high barrier of entry that should limit competition. Further, as more people receive education about the myriad positive benefits of psychedelic medicine, investors will gradually lift SHRMF stock.

7 Stocks to Buy That Save You Money

Also, consider the present environment. Due to the social and financial stress of the coronavirus pandemic, mental health issues have accelerated. Psychedelics may offer an effective solution where other treatments have failed, thereby lifting the case for Champignon Brands.

Revive Therapeutics (RVVTF) penny stocks Revive Therapeutics (RVVTF)

Earlier this year, Revive Therapeutics enjoyed an explosive catalyst thanks to the coronavirus. A life sciences company, Revive announced that it was exploring the drug Bucillamine as a potential treatment for Covid-19. The move to focus on a treatment as opposed to a vaccine likely contributed to the astounding momentum of RVVTF stock.

For one thing, a vaccine won’t help those who already have Covid-19. More importantly, we just don’t know how long it will take for a vaccine to hit the market, let alone administer it to billions across the globe. Plus, many folks have apprehensions about taking a vaccine. And don’t get me started about the implications of the government forcing everyone to take it.

Thus, Revive’s proposal strikes a healthy balance. However, RVVTF stock is more than just a play on the coronavirus. In February of this year, Revive announced the acquisition of Psilocin Pharma, which specializes in psychedelic-based therapies. As I mentioned for Champignon, psychedelics are relevant for mental health issues that will last beyond this pandemic.

However, do note the risks associated with very cheap penny stocks. With RVVTF currently priced at 14 cents, you can expect a wild ride.

American Lithium (LIACF) penny stocks American Lithium (LIACF)

With the slow but steady transition toward EVs, investors should take a long look at penny stocks levered toward the lithium mining industry. Yes, mining companies are well known for their incredible volatility. Further, the lithium market hasn’t exactly been the bastion of stability. Nevertheless, if you’re willing to absorb some risk, you may want to check out American Lithium.

Focused on the production of the metal in Nevada, American Lithium offers insulation from geopolitical turbulence. Additionally, Nevada-based production may be far superior to lithium sourced in other regions, thereby bolstering the case for LIACF stock.

In an email sent to me by Andrew Bowering, founder and director of American Lithium, he stated, “The Nevada Department of Geology has made a bold prediction that Nevada will one day be producing 25% of the world’s lithium. It is very possible.” Additionally, Bowering noted:

“Chinese production challenges result from their brines being average grades of lithium but very high in Magnesium Sulfates. In addition, the production of lithium from brine requires the use of approximately 500,000 litres of water for every tonne of lithium carbonate in a typical evaporation pond operation. China has little known resources of hard rock pegmatites or claystones amenable to extraction at this time. Accordingly, they are required to seek lithium compounds and concentrates globally.”

Of course, LIACT stock isn’t guaranteed to rise because of Nevada’s favorable platform. However, this combined with growing economic demand for lithium-based technologies makes American Lithium worth a shot, especially compared to some other penny stocks out there.

Due to mounting fears of economic calamity along with social unrest, it’s no surprise that gold-related penny stocks have shot up in demand. If you’re interested in this sector, you should go with the established names, such as Newmont (NYSE:NEM) or Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM). This way, you can enjoy the rise in precious metals while mitigating some of the volatility.

However, if you’re adventurous and you understand the risks associated with penny stocks, you may want to check out Fosterville South Exploration. The company has three high-grade gold projects that are centered in the Fosterville area, located in southeastern Australia. As Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL) has proven, it’s a viable place to mine gold.

Further, Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South, explained to me via email the fundamental catalyst for FSXLF stock:

“With the world having entered a phase of quantitative easing infinity, huge fiscal and monetary stimuli and low to negative interest rates, the conditions for the price of gold bullion itself are as good as I have ever seen them. Investors who have invested in the space before, know that in gold bull markets, gold equities outperform the price of the metal itself. Therefore, we are seeing a perfect storm for gold stocks.”

I’m biased, but I couldn’t agree more. Still, like any speculative sector, I encourage due diligence before engaging. That said, the company’s link to the highest-grade, low-cost gold mine is a compelling argument for FSXLF stock.

Although it’s tempting to just focus on the negative headlines and react accordingly, over the long run, this pandemic will be a chapter in our history books. Logically, this means that industries of technology and innovation will continue to press forward, pushing the envelope. If you have a longer-term window, then United Microelectronics may be the right speculative investment for you.

A semiconductor company specializing in integrated circuit wafers, United Microelectronics is essentially levered to a permanently strong revenue pool. That’s not to say that UMC stock is guaranteed upside — far from it. Rather, digitalization is only increasing across the globe. Therefore, United Microelectronics could be a discount at these coronavirus-impacted prices.

7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends

Also, what makes UMC stock particularly attractive is the competition. With the big dogs in the semiconductor space having jumped to ridiculous levels in recent years, United is a comparative bargain. Of course, you don’t want to jump recklessly into this boat. At the same time, if you’re tired of overvalued semiconductor stocks, UMC might fit the bill.

BIGG Digital Assets (BBKCF) BIGG Digital Assets (BBKCF)

With BIGG Digital Assets, I’ve saved the most intense name in this list of penny stocks for last. By intense, I’m referring to the potential for incredible riches. For one thing, BBKCF stock is priced below a dime. So, just through the law of small numbers, you could make a killing.

However, do note that with penny stocks, you can also get killed. If you can’t afford to lose the money you put into BIGG, I have two words for you: stay away!

Yet if you’re willing to accept the risk, BBKCF stock is levered to a compelling business that will only grow in pertinence. A blockchain-based organization, BIGG Digital Assets owns and operates cryptocurrency-related companies that support a regulated and compliant ecosystem. In other words, BIGG is looking to mainstream blockchain-powered solutions and platforms.

In my opinion, I believe BIGG’s QLUE business offers the most potential. An acronym that stands for “Qualitative Law Enforcement Unified Edge,” QLUE assists law enforcement agencies in tracking down crypto-related crimes. While decentralization offers consumer-level benefits, it also opens the door to nefarious actors.

With QLUE, governments can potentially crack down on financial cybercrimes. As interest picks up in the crypto space, such enforcement measures will only increase in demand.

* Foxconn plant operations disrupted due to delays-sources

* Several U.S. lobby groups have complained to Indian govt

* Indian officials say situation should ease soon

By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal

NEW DELHI, July 2 (Reuters) - India's additional scrutiny of imports from China has disrupted operations at plants owned by Apple supplier Foxconn in southern India, three sources told Reuters, and other foreign firms are also facing delays as tensions between the two countries build.

Customs officers at Indian ports have held back shipments from China and sought additional clearances after deadly clashes at the disputed Himalayan border last month. The checks have been imposed without any formal order.

While several companies such as Apple and Dell have been battling to free stuck shipments, hundreds of employees at Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn's two plants in the south had no major work to do this week as shipments were delayed, sources said.

More than 150 Foxconn shipments - containing smartphone and electronic parts - were stuck at the port of Chennai, though some are being cleared slowly now, the first source said. The total number of parts in the shipments was not clear.

Foxconn's two plants in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh state mainly assemble Apple and Xiaomi smartphones in the country and employ thousands of workers, many of whom stay in company-provided accommodation.

""Foxconn was in a very bad state ... lots of workers stayed at the dormitory because there was no work,"" said the first source.

Foxconn, Apple and Xiaomi did not respond to Reuters queries.

The finance ministry also did not respond. Two officials at the ministry, which oversees the customs department, said the inspection measures were temporary and will ease soon.

""We cannot keep checking 100% of shipments forever ... Shipments of non-Chinese companies being impacted will be cleared on priority,"" said one official.

Story continues

While the exact impact of the disruptions is not immediately clear, the delays come when companies in India had already been battling disrupted supply chains due to coronavirus shutdowns in recent months. Business activity has only just begun to pick up.

Prominent U.S.-India lobby groups and local industry bodies have urged the Indian government to intervene.

While some delayed Dell shipments have been cleared since last week, the company had roughly 130 shipments stuck this week at Indian ports, the second source said. This included around six shipping containers with parts for servers and desktop computers, the person added.

Dell did not respond to a request for comment.

Separately, MG Motor, owned by China's SAIC, also has some shipments stuck at a port in southern India, a source close to the company told Reuters. MG started selling cars in India last year and has committed $650 million in investments.

""The whole (auto) industry will be impacted if components are stuck,"" the source said.

MG Motor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China's Commerce Ministry said on Thursday that it hoped India would correct its discriminatory actions against Chinese companies immediately, after India banned some Chinese mobile apps amid the border crisis.

Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) has postponed the reopening of its theme parks. These just some of the hundreds of ripple effects from the pandemic.

In a climate of rampant uncertainty, what should an investor do?

My answer: You should do what you should do in normal times - buy the stocks of good companies when they are laid low by bad new that's real but probably temporary.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with AAPL. Click here to check it out.  AAPL 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of AAPL Peter Lynch Chart of AAPL

One place to find candidates is on my Casualty List, a quarterly list I compile of stocks that have fallen in the most recent quarter, but that I think can recover and even thrive.

The Casualty List you're about to see is the 69th one I've compiled. The average one-year gain on the first 65 of them has ben 15.5%. That compares well with the 9.2% average for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index over the same periods. (Figures are total returns including dividends.)

Of the 65 Casualty Lists, 42 have been profitable and 33 have beaten the S&P 500.

Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don't reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn't be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn't predict future results.

Biogen

I'll start my latest Casualty List with Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). It sells for about $259 a share, down from well over $300 in April.

The stock took a tumble in April after failure in clinical trials for a proposed Alzheimer's drug. Investors had pinned high hopes on that. But for perspective, nobody has come up with a good Alzheimer's drug yet.

With a product line consisting of a dozen drugs, Biogen gets 80% of its revenue for six drugs that treat multiple sclerosis. Two key drugs in that group have patents that expire soon. The rest of revenue comes from drugs for leukemia and hemophilia.

Story continues

I consider a return on stockholders' equity of 20% or better to be outstanding. Biogen has achieved that nine years in a row, and last year it notched more than 40%.

Because of the looming patent cliff, Biogen shares sell for only eight times earnings. That's bargain territory, and I'm willing to bet on the company's research prowess to refill the pipeline.

Southwest Airlines

Right now, people are afraid to travel and afraid to be cooped up on a closed plane with a bunch of other people, one of whom might have coronavirus. How long will that problem persist? My guess is 18 to 24 months.

That's a long time to wait, but I think Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) has big capital gains potential for patient holders. At about $32 a share (down from over $60 in parts of 2017 and 2018), it sells for nine times the past four quarters' earnings. Its normal multiple is about 17.

By reputation, Southwest has the best fleet management in the airline industry. While many airlines struggle for profit, Southwest scored a return on equity above 20% five years in a row through 2019.

Barnes Group

Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE:B) gets little press coverage and scant Wall Street coverage. Only seven analysts follow it, and only three of those recommend it.

The company based in Bristol, Connecticut makes engineered parts for industrial and aerospace customers. It has shown a profit in each of the past 15 years, and its stock normally sells for about 19 times earnings. The multiple is only 12 now.

NEW DELHI, June 24 (Reuters) - Apple, Cisco and Dell products are among the goods from U.S. companies being caught up in India's border tensions with China, as Indian ports hold up imports from China, two sources told Reuters on Wednesday.

Though no government notice has been issued, customs officers at major Indian port have held back containers coming from China, seeking additional clearances, government and industry sources have said.

The move comes amid heightened tensions between India and China after border clashes last week that saw at least 20 Indian soldiers killed.

The U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a lobby group representing U.S. firms, told India's commerce ministry in a letter dated June 23 that lack of clarity and delays could disrupt business and manufacturing operations.

""Authorities have abruptly halted the clearance of industry consignments coming in from China (and perhaps other destinations) at most major ports and airports,"" USISPF said in the letter, seen by Reuters.

""This will send a chilling signal to foreign investors who look for predictability and transparency,"" it said.

The commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Two industry sources said Apple, Cisco, Dell and Ford Motor Co products were among those held up. Electronics components of Taiwan's Foxconn, a contract manufacturer for Apple in India, were also affected, a third source said.

It was not immediately clear which ports were holding back the goods.

Apple, Cisco and Foxconn did not respond to requests for comment. A Dell spokeswoman declined to comment, while Ford said a consignment of auto parts was held up at a port in the southern city of Chennai and the company was providing information sought by the authorities.

The delays come as India is restarting factory operations after a nationwide lockdown to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indian electronics and mobile industry group ICEA said its members had been told Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi Airports would have a new examination procedure for all consignments coming from China.

Normally, goods for regular importers are cleared automatically, ICEA said in a letter to the finance ministry, urging it to intervene.

India's finance ministry, which oversees the customs department, did not respond to a request for comment.

Since no one knows which asset classes will lead and which will lag, diversification is paramount. And Vanguard ETFs are an easy way to get some diversification.

If you’re further than 10 years from retirement, it’s wise to lean towards a more aggressive portfolio to capture the higher equity returns. As retirement approaches, dial back equities and increase fixed and cash equivalent holdings.

If you’re healthy and retire in your 60’s you might have an additional 20-plus years in retirement, so don’t forgo the stock market. In fact, you may want to ramp up equity investing as your retirement advances. This reverse glidepath strategy was suggested by Michael Kitces and Wade Pfau in an article on the Nerd’s Eye View entitled, “Should Equity Exposure Decrease In Retirement, Or Is A Rising Equity Glidepath Actually Better?”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

These three Vanguard exchange-traded funds will work when building a retirement portfolio as well as during the drawdown years. Each of the Vanguard funds can be purchased through any investment account, while other financial firms offer comparable funds. The key to this simple retirement portfolio is to  invest in low-fee index ETFs that fit within these categories.

7 A-Rated Growth Stocks That Are Loaded With Long-Term Potential

The rationale for a three-fund retirement portfolio is as follows. First, a simple investment portfolio in retirement leaves time for what matters most. Second, it provides diversification to minimize losses in a particular sector while maintaining broad exposure to the main asset classes and global markets. And finally, it cuts investment fees to the bone.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (NYSEARCA:VEU) Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NASDAQ:BND)

And now, let’s get further into why I like these three funds in particular.

Story continues

Best Vanguard ETFs: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

Expense Ratio: 0.03%, or $3 per $10,000 invested annually.

This U.S. stock market fund tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index. The benchmark includes companies spanning the mega-, large-, small- and micro-capitalization field and represents nearly 100% of the U.S. investable equity market.

The fund utilizes a passively managed, index-sampling strategy. VTI offers rock-bottom expenses and minimal tracking error versus the benchmark index. This total stock market fund owns roughly 3,500 stocks, with 22.6% of the assets in the 10 largest names.

The fund uses a market cap weighting, which means that returns will be influenced by the momentum growth of the biggest firms.

Investors seeking a more value-leaning equal weight US stock index fund might consider the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA:RSP).

The funds sector weightings approximate the benchmark index, with approximately 25% in the technology sector, 17% in financials, 15% in healthcare and 14% in consumer services.

The largest holdings read like a who’s-who in American commerce and include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The returns of the fund parallel those of the index with a 10-year average annual return of 12.8%, and one-, three- and five-year returns of 11.5%, 9.6%, and 9.2% respectively.

Investing in the U.S. equity market has been a sound investment strategy for decades, and the 0.03% expense ratio is among the most affordable ways of capturing this growth. The current 1.8% 30-day SEC yield is higher than investors receive on most short-term cash equivalents.

Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU)

Expense Ratio: 0.08%

This large-cap-leaning international fund invests in developing and emerging market global companies. The passively managed fund attempts to match the returns of the FTSE All World ex-U.S. index. Investors willing to take a bit more risk for potentially higher returns among Vanguard ETFs might consider the Vanguard Total Stock International Index ETF (NASDAQ:VXUS) instead, which includes greater small-cap international exposure.

Like VTI, the VEU’s holdings are weighted by market cap, so the larger companies are a greater proportion of the fund. The allocation is geographically diversified, with 41% invested in Europe, 23% in in Emerging Markets, 29% in the Pacific and the remaining firms from North America and the Middle East.

The top holdings are well-known global names. Although, the top 10 holdings make up only 11.5% of the total fund assets. The largest holdings include Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) and Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Other major companies are representatives of the auto, pharmaceutical, electronic and oil industries.

10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge

The fund’s 0.08% expense ratio keeps most investment dollars in the markets, not flowing to the fund manager. Recently, international markets have underperformed the U.S., but seem to be turning around this year.

Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

Expense Ratio: 0.035%

A total bond market fund rounds out this three-piece retirement portfolio of Vanguard ETFs. Bonds are still valuable to own as eventually; interest rates will rise along with bond yields.

Another Vanguard low-fee offer, BND is an intermediate bond fund with the objective to track a broad, market-weight bond index. Included in the fund are taxable investment-grade U.S. bonds. With 9,568 bonds and an average duration of 6.4 years, the current SEC yield is 1.4%.

The fund is heavily weighted to U.S. Government bonds, with 61% in this asset class. The next-highest weighting of 19% is in Baa rated bonds. And 12.6% of the fund is invested in A bonds with a small percent allocated to Aaa and Aa rated bonds. The 0.035% expense ratio is negligible.

In summation, create your asset allocation to fit your comfort with investment volatility. Allot greater percentages to the stock market if you’re younger and more comfortable with risk. If not, bulk up your bond investment.

Retirees should consider their short and intermediate cash flow needs and invest accordingly. Meanwhile, it’s prudent to keep at least one year’s living expenses in a high yield cash account.

554,2020-06-15T11:53:05+00:00,Exciting Tech ETF May Be More Defensive Than It Appears,"Leveraged exchange traded funds, such as the Direxion Daily Technology Bull3X Shares (NYSE: TECL), usually aren't viewed as defensive ideas. They certainly aren't long-term trades, but some market observers are highlighting the defensive properties of technology stocks.

What Happened

TECL is designed to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index. In effect, TECL is a leveraged play on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) because those two stock combine for about 40% of the Technology Select Sector Index.

No, the tech sector hasn't been perfect this year. It's taken some lumps along with other groups at the hands of the coronavirus, but it's also been one of the best-performing groups, a theme some experts see continuing in the back half of the year.

Why It's Important

“While tech earnings have been hit along with everyone else, they are holding up remarkably well,” said BlackRock in a recent note. “This is not surprising. Although the lockdown is crushing spending, tech continues to dominate wallet share, both for individuals and companies. A recent Fortune 500 CEO poll found that 75% of companies plan to increase technology spending.”

TECL is higher by 24% of the past month and since the start of the second quarter, traders added nearly $32 million to the geared tech fund. However, TECL's bearish counterpart – the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS) – has inflows of $40.15 million since April 1. Leveraged ETFs are often fertile territory for contrarian bets, but the bullish TECL looks like the way to proceed over the near-term.

“Many of the business and broader societal changes demanded by the virus accelerate existing trends: internet commerce, cloud computing, gaming, streaming and remote communication,” according to BlackRock. “One example: retail e-commerce spending is up nearly 60% year-over-year. While some of this is temporary and should reverse as the crisis fades, many of these trends will remain long after COVID 19 has been defeated.”

Story continues

What's Next

As for issues that could bring the bearish TECS into focus, politics and rapid developments on the coronavirus vaccine front come to mind. It's hard to see the latter derailing tech, but it could encourage some investors to  embrace riskier sectors, forcing lower allocations to higher quality tech.

Regarding November elections, “it is easy to forget that a potentially seismic election is less than six months away. Depending on the outcome, the policy environment could shift in ways less favorable for large tech firms,” said BlackRock.

Teddy Parrish of Parrish Capital joins The Final Round to discuss his thoughts on the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: I want to bring in our first guest here, Teddy Parrish of Parrish Capital. And Teddy, let's first get your take on what we're seeing-- what we've been talking about. Now, the market response to the Fed's announcement today. I guess from your perspective, do you think the market still believes that the Fed is in whatever it takes mode?

TEDDY PARRISH: Yes, it is. I think the Fed's really focused on the depth of the recession. And that's its primary focus. And while we've seen a few green shoots of activity, it is still critical that the Fed keeps its foot on the gas and maintains it's by any means necessary actions. They are doing so by keeping rates near 0 through 2022 and also expanding the balance sheet by buying corporate and mortgage bonds. So that's critical.

And I also think it's critical that we have more fiscal policy. And hopefully it's forthcoming. And we expect further provisions for corporations and consumers to aid in the recovery to get us back to a self-sustaining expansion if necessary. I don't think we've seen the worst of the contraction in terms of the damage that can come for corporations and consumers alike.

SEANA SMITH: Well, Teddy, taking a look at the levels that we're at today-- NASDAQ above 10,000. At the same time, we had the Fed throwing a little bit of cold water on what we've been seeing, also, cautioning the fact that the virus still poses considerable risk. So do you think the market at all is getting a little of ahead of itself at this point?

TEDDY PARRISH: Yeah, I mean, you know, so we welcome the performance and the rebound, of course. But we are long-term bullish on a US and global economy and stock markets. And we have participated in the comeback. But, you know, this robust recovery in the stock market's pretty much priced in recovery for the economy in, say, 2021.

Story continues

I mean, if you look at earnings projections, they're unreliable for the next couple quarters. So it's a big wall of worry that we have to climb. You know, six months is a long time before we have full recovery. I mean, we're like puppies. It's going to be like dog years. You know, that's a long way to go before we're clear of this virus.

RICK NEWMAN: Hey, Teddy, if you're an investor-- fear, you know, who's looking around and saying to yourself, well, I really missed out, are there any sectors that are lagging sectors that will catch up with where the broader market is or, at least, let's say where some of the tech names are?

TEDDY PARRISH: Yes. So as I look at the market, there are, of course, pockets of frothiness in growth in momentum stocks like you talked about earlier-- Amazon and Tesla and some of the other momentum players-- who, as a whole, we think that the indices themselves are fully priced. But there are pockets of compelling opportunities and early cyclicals and value stocks.

For instance, you talked about financials. I happen to think that there are great opportunities there. Most of those companies have maintained their dividends. I know interest rates are low. So net interest margins may shrink. But their balance sheets are pretty solid, especially the ones that we own.

I think consumer staples-- you know, they've been a very big beneficiary of the increased demand due to the virus. And they have some pretty good pricing power which we don't hear that a lot. And we expect that trend to continue. So we have some stocks in consumer staples that we still like-- Heinz, Celestial. Even Kraft Heinz, which has been a dog the past few years, I think it's actually perked up a bit. And we also like Walgreens.

And the energy sector, although it was a nightmare earlier this year, I think it's turned the corner with prices coming back up. And there's compelling values there. We own the big major integrators there. And BP, Occidental Petroleum, Royal Dutch, and even Schlumberger.

AKIKO FUJITA: Teddy, we had a guest on yesterday who talked about the moral hazard, as she saw it, that the Fed has put itself in now that it's dipped its hands into ETFs. And the thinking there was that the market would continue to rely on the Fed to jump in when we hit the lows and that the Fed would need to send a stronger message to say this is a one-time thing. We certainly haven't seen the kind of distortion we've seen with other central banks, like the Bank of Japan. But I'm curious how you view that risk and how the market is viewing the Fed's hands in that right now.

TEDDY PARRISH: Well, I think the Fed's actions in central banks around the world that their actions have been a main-- one of main ingredients in the recovery. There's a lot of liquidity out there. And I think everyone is taking the right tone. This is a pandemic, a crisis that's unlike any other. So, I mean, you got to through all of the tools at it. And we'll have to pay the piper at some point. But at this time, I mean, it's by any means necessary to get the global economy back to where it needs to be.

ANDY SERWER: Teddy, I got to tell you-- you've got a lot of nerve.

TEDDY PARRISH: Mm-hmm

ANDY SERWER: You are a brave man or be suggesting you should be underweighting tech. OK, now, I'm a tech bull. I see you when you say you underweighting tech. Come on, seriously? The trade of our lifetime. And you are not so sure about that, right?

TEDDY PARRISH: Well, I'm underweight tech now. I wasn't a few months ago. So we took the time to actually rebalance portfolios I actually manage money for individuals who are retired. So we have this thing we call a liquidity window philosophy where we set aside three to five years worth of cash for spending needs so that money is not at risk. And they don't have to sell in adverse environments.

So that's one of the areas I took a little from because they were right at all-time highs. And, you know, so I pinched a little from there. So we're slightly underweight. But if you add in the consumer communications services sector back to tech, then we're slightly underweight, because I consider Google and BIDU tech stocks. But they're actually in the communication services sector.

ANDY SERWER: Got it. Thank you.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Teddy Parrish of Parrish Capital. Always great to get your perspective.

556,2020-05-28T22:00:04+00:00,Little-Known Data Show Signs of a Tech Bounce,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Buried in a set of little-known data are early signs that the hardware side of the technology sector may be rebounding from the pandemic-driven plunge.

Investors generally need to wait until a few weeks after a quarter closes to get a sense of how well (or badly) business has been, or hope that a company will provide an update when the situation changes.

Except in Taiwan. A decades-old regulation requires companies there to report sales every month. This information isn’t useful only to investors in locally traded stocks. What’s listed is a broad range of companies that make chips, components, half-assembled modules and final products used in almost every electronics device in the world. The numbers can also provide a snapshot of output in China, where most Taiwanese technology manufacturers have the bulk of production.

As early as January, it became obvious that the coronavirus would be a nightmare for tech companies. We now know that Apple Inc. posted a 7.2% drop in March-quarter sales of iPhones and iPads, while its major supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, suffered its biggest dive in revenue for seven years.

More interesting is to see what’s been going on since. A look at April sales data from Taiwan enabled me to crunch numbers. What we find is a bounce in revenue that gives some hope for the global sector.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. are the most famous names in this data set, because they’re the biggest in their category and have a VIP client list that includes Apple, Qualcomm Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. and Sony Corp. Yet hundreds of others, such as Pegatron Corp., Quanta Computer Inc. and Largan Precision Co., collectively supply most of the industry.

By aggregating the data month by month, comparing to a year earlier to smooth out seasonality, and looking at the sub-sectors within tech — defined by the Taiwan Stock Exchange — such as components suppliers, chipmakers, or computer assemblers, we can get an understanding of what was happening just a few weeks ago.

Story continues

Computers and peripherals, which include major PC and server makers Quanta and Compal Electronics Inc., showed the largest rebound, from an 11.9% drop in the January to March period to a 7.9% rise in April. Electronics parts and components, such as circuit-board supplier Compeq Manufacturing Co., turned a mild decline into solid growth, from a 3.1% decline into a 9.1% increase. Other electronics, including Hon Hai, which not only assembles iPhones but servers and networking equipment, went from an 11.8% fall to flat. Chips, headlined by TSMC, remained incredibly strong. Optoelectronics, which is largely displays and camera modules, shows a prolonged decline.

One of the key takeaways is the relative strength in corporate-focused hardware, and possible continued weakness in gadgets. Foxconn pointed to this earlier in May, when it told investors that its consumer-devices division, which encompasses iPhones, would fall at least 15%, while enterprise products would climb 10%.

There are two important caveats to the data.

The first is that they track just Taipei-listed companies, and not some big names like Huawei and Samsung Electronics Co., which also manufacture their own hardware. However, it’s a like-for-like comparison — those companies aren’t included in last year’s data, either — and the broad reach of Taiwan’s tech sector means that even Huawei and Samsung are likely part of its supply chain.

A more important note is that this is just for one month. Some of that April uptick is simply catch-up production for time lost at the height of the pandemic. Yet clients wouldn’t place orders if they didn’t feel that there’s end-demand somewhere. Autos and textiles are cutting production and shuttering factories in the knowledge that such a pickup in sales isn’t likely.

With global turmoil making companies reticent to give predictions, investors wait in the dark for an update or a quarterly conference call. Even if we don’t know whether this is a true rebound, or merely a dead-cat bounce, at least there’s more timely data available to examine.

557,2020-05-20T22:00:03+00:00,The Robots-Are-Taking-Our-Jobs Threat Gets Real,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If there was ever a good time for the robots-taking-over-jobs argument, this may be it. Not just because factory owners don’t want to pay for rising labor costs, but because workers don’t want to gather every day in petri dishes.

Chinese manufacturing is facing a challenge since employees returned to production lines: keeping them on the job. Some companies reported a 90% turnover in workforce after the economy started reopening in March, compared to 25% to 30% in a normal, pre-coronavirus year. Such spikes are expected worldwide as lockdowns ease. The pandemic has made “humans the risk to continued operations” in supply chains, note analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Leave aside how businesses reopen. The bigger question is, how will they be thinking about the future of their factories?

Re-enter the robot, or more precisely, automation, a trend that was already alarming labor advocates and will be aggravated by Covid-19. Nascent signs from the order books of industry giants like Fanuc Corp., Keyence Corp. and Harmonic Drive Systems Inc. point to businesses wanting to get their operations up and running – increasingly, without humans.Industrial robot exports from Japan, the heartland of automation machinery, grew to some parts of the world from the previous year. Fanuc, maker of robots used in factories for companies ranging from Apple Inc. to Amazon.com Inc., saw orders in the fourth quarter to March climb 7%. Its revenues in the U.S. and China rose, while inventories of components ticked down as demand edged up. Bookings also increased for Harmonic Drive, which makes parts for small robots. This interest was manifested while the world was consumed by the initial shock wave of Covid-19, suggesting how big a priority automation has become.

There’s room for robots. Worldwide, density remains low as many companies have had little desire to deal with integrating them into operations, or in triggering politically sensitive social backlash. Still, nearly 60% of production work globally is in areas that can easily be automated. In China, almost 40% of jobs are machine replaceable. Differences across and within industries matter — robots do most of the stamping and welding in car factories, while humans conduct final inspections. Tasks requiring significant dexterity remain difficult for machines.A big change in the Covid-19 era may be the lowering of barriers to adoption, which have largely come down to attitude. South Korea and Germany can be held out as positive examples that have achieved high factory-automation levels while keeping unemployment low. A more pointed prod, though, may be simple necessity, which has driven most big changes in the way we use technology. The global health emergency has hamstrung companies in a way most never expected. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC of almost 300 chief financial officers found that they didn’t get what they needed to make informed decisions and response times were delayed. More automation could improve agility. While most CFOs of industrial production companies surveyed plan to cancel or defer investments, only 15% are planning to cut investments for automation, artificial intelligence and industrial internet-of-things.

Story continues

The post-coronavirus dilemma looks like the old one, but worse. The world will need more productivity, and automation is a way to get it. In Germany, deploying robots led to an increase of gross domestic product per capita of 0.5% over 10 years. But what will happen to displaced, less-skilled workers? The pandemic could reduce working hours by 6.7% across the world, equivalent to 195 million full-time workers, according to the International Labour Organization. For now, governments are offering wage subsidies to businesses to retain employees. The onus will eventually also fall on companies to reskill and accommodate their workers. Separately, governments are incentivizing the transition to the robotic future. Japan wants companies to bring supply chains home from China. Where there aren’t enough skilled workers, more machines will be needed to collaborate – or so-called Cobots. In China itself, industrial subsidies that support automation loom large. “New infrastructure” has become a way to justify fiscal stimulus that will put billions of dollars toward 5G and other technologies that will employ far fewer people.

This doesn’t mean the end of productive human labor, or the loss of jobs en masse. It does require more openness to exploring options in addition to, and beyond, people. The reality is, companies that invest in automating processes now are likely to come out faster – and perhaps stronger — on the other side. Not only because robots won’t be sick or afraid in the petri dish, but because the future of work is changing. No one wanted the Covid-19 experiment. But companies and people have to come to terms with it.

Charles Schwab Chief Fixed Income Strategist Kathy Jones joins Yahoo Finance’s Seana Smith to discuss.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to ""The Ticker"" here on Yahoo Finance. I'm Seana Smith. The Treasury Department planning to borrow about $3 trillion in the second quarter, as it does what it can to limit the economic impact from the coronavirus pandemic. Now to help finance its multi-trillion dollar deficits this year, the Treasury Department selling 20-year bonds today. It's the first time that this has happened since 1986.

So for more on this, we have Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. And Kathy, thanks so much for taking the time to join this show today. Let's head to the Treasury's plans here, the prospect of increasing supply on the horizon. My question to you is, what does this mean for yields? And just, can yields stay low in this type of environment?

KATHY JONES: Well, I think they can, as long as the economy is soft and inflation is low, which we think is going to continue for quite some time. You know, the capacity to absorb this is pretty good, given that rates all over the world are very low. So despite the fact that ours are below-- say, 10-year yields are below 1%, that actually is pretty good compared to most of the rest of the developed world.

And the second thing is that I think with the Fed anchoring short-term interest rates near zero, that's going to put a lid on longer term rates going forward.

SEANA SMITH: And Kathy, I just want to ask you just the other big question here is just about potential inflation, especially with the balance sheet size. We had Fed chair Jerome Powell, though, yesterday reiterating the fact that the balance sheet size isn't raising any inflation concerns. I'm just curious what your thoughts are about that.

KATHY JONES: Yeah, we're not seeing any inflation concerns on the horizon anywhere soon. I mean, first of all, we have to get through the deflation that we're experiencing right now before we worry about inflation. And a lot of people look at the Fed's balance sheet and try to equate that to inflation down the road. That didn't work in the 2008, 2009 time period.

Story continues

In fact, money supply growth, if that's what people are looking at, has really only worked as an indicator of inflation in the late '70s and early '80s. And since then, there's been virtually no correlation at all. So a concern-- there's certainly concern about that sustainability and about whether or not we're, you know, able to eventually started to outgrow the debt, or at least catch up in growth to the debt. But I think those are all-- inflation's a concern for well down the road.

SEANA SMITH: And Kathy, going off of that, just this massive injection of liquidity from both the fed and also from a fiscal point of view from Congress, how effective you think these measures have been just in order to try to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic?

KATHY JONES: Well, I think there's been a lot of success in the market. So if you look at where credit spreads were, the difference between yields and corporate bonds and treasury bonds, they have come in quite substantially. They're still above the long term average, but definitely have declined quite a bit. And that was before the Fed even bought a single bond or bought a single ETF.

So the signaling allowed was pretty significant. Similar story, commercial paper market that they tried to help out, the money market. All of that injection of liquidity or discussion of injection of liquidity had a big impact on the market. And over time, having the rates normalize or rates come down, that allows financing for households and businesses to continue at a reasonable rate. So I think so far, so good on those plans.

SEANA SMITH: And Kathy, I want to ask you about this because you mentioned it in one of your recent notes, and we've been talking about it here on the show, and just this disconnect that we've been seeing the market performance and also what we've been getting on the data front. From your perspective, why do you think the gap between the market and economic performance is so wide at this point?

KATHY JONES: Well, I think two things. There's always a bit of the market tries to discount the future. But we also have-- we also have an analogy here that most investors are very aware of. And that is after the Fed stepped in, in 2009, risk assets did very, very well for a decade. I mean, it was a pretty smooth ride if you hopped on board and you made a lot of money.

And I think what happened this time around is the Fed stepped in very early and very aggressively. And investors said, oh, I know how this plays out. You know, I'm going to ride this wave, just as I should have done perhaps in 2008, 2009. So I think that it sort of reinforces the impression I got when it first happened, this whole thing first happened.

And as the markets began to sell off, the calls I was getting from investors weren't about what should I sell. It was what should I buy. And so I think there is a heightened risk appetite when people think the Fed has their back.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. Always great to have you on the show.

559,2020-05-19T02:22:52+00:00,"Sony, Microsoft Strike Deal on Tiny AI Chip With Huge Potential","(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have partnered to embed artificial intelligence capabilities into the Japanese company’s latest imaging chip, a big boost for a camera product the electronics giant describes as a world-first for commercial customers.

The new module’s big advantage is that it has its own processor and memory built in, which allows it to analyze video using AI tech like Microsoft’s Azure, but in a self-contained system that’s faster, simpler and more secure to operate than existing methods.

The two companies are appealing to retail and logistics businesses with potential uses like optimizing warehouse and factory automation, quantifying the flow of customers through stores and making cars smarter about their drivers and environment.

At a time of increasing public surveillance to help rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus, this new smart camera also has the potential to offer more privacy-conscious monitoring. And should its technology be adapted for personal devices, it even holds promise for advancing mobile photography.

Instead of generating actual images, Sony’s AI chip can analyze the video it sees and provide just metadata about what’s in front of it -- saying instead of showing what’s in its frame of vision. Because no data is sent to remote servers, opportunities for hackers to intercept sensitive images or video are dramatically reduced, which should help allay privacy fears.

Apple Inc. has already proven the efficacy of combining AI and imaging to create more secure systems with its Face ID biometric authentication, powered by the iPhone’s custom-designed Neural Engine processor. Huawei Technologies Co. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google also have dedicated AI silicon in their smartphones to assist with image processing. These on-device chips represent what’s known as edge computing: handling complex AI and machine-learning tasks at the so-called edge of the network instead of sending data back and forth to servers.

Story continues

“We are aware many companies are developing AI chips and it’s not like we try to make our AI chip better than others,” said Hideki Somemiya, senior general manager of Sony’s System Solutions group. “Our focus is on how we can distribute AI computing across the system, taking cost and efficiency into consideration. Edge computing is a trend, and in that respect, ours is the edge of the edge.”

Sony’s advance is to eliminate the need for transfers within the device itself. Whereas Apple and Google still use conventional image sensors that convert light particles into computer-readable image formats for their chips to read, Sony’s new part is capable of doing the analytical work without any data leaving its physical boundaries.

The AI-capable sensor may also help advance augmented reality applications. The two U.S. giants, whose iOS and Android operating systems control practically the entire smartphone market, are heavily invested in AR development. Google Maps now offers the option to show 3-D directions atop a video feed of a user’s surroundings while Apple is planning new 3-D cameras on its next set of iPhones in the fall. The agenda-setters of the mobile industry are looking for ever smarter mobile cameras, spurring the demand for more sophisticated imaging gear.

Sony already enjoys a substantial lead as the world’s foremost provider of image sensors, counting Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and every major Chinese smartphone maker among its customers along with pro camera stalwarts like Hasselblad V, Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Nikon Corp.

Its next set of customers may be automakers.

The AI-powered Sony sensor is capable of recording high-resolution video and simultaneously conducting its AI analysis at up to 30 frames each second. That rapid, up-to-the-microsecond responsiveness makes it potentially suitable for in-car use such as detecting when a driver is falling asleep, Sony’s Somemiya said. Without the need for a “cloud brain” as some existing systems have, Sony’s AI sensor could hasten the adoption of smart-car technology.

”This on-chip approach enables a system design to be more flexible and even optimized, given that the cost of image processing, which is one of the most compute-intensive tasks for autonomous driving, can be offloaded from an electronic control unit,” said Shinpei Kato, founder and chief technology officer of Tokyo-based Tier IV Inc., which develops self-driving software.

560,2020-05-18T04:13:45+00:00,U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech Industry,"(Bloomberg) --

Since its founding more than three decades ago, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has built its business by working behind the scenes to make customers like Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. shine. Now the low-profile chipmaker has landed squarely in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, an incalculably valuable asset that both sides are vying to control.

The Trump administration opened up a new front in the conflict on Friday by barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co. without U.S. government approval. That means TSMC and rivals will have to cut off Huawei unless they get waivers from the U.S. Commerce Dept. TSMC has already stopped accepting new orders from Huawei, the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday.

The move threatens to wreak havoc throughout the complex ecosystem that produces technology for consumers and companies around the world. An attack on Huawei threatens not just its workers and its standing as a world leader in making smartphones and telecom equipment, but also hundreds of suppliers. The Chinese government has vowed to protect its national champion, with threats of retribution against U.S. companies that depend on China like Apple Inc. and Boeing Co.

“China likely will retaliate, and investors should brace themselves for a possible trade war escalation,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a research note on Friday.

Huawei suppliers across Asia fell on Monday, with AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., Q Technology Group Co., Sunwoda Electronic and Lens Technology all sliding 5% or more. TSMC, which gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei, dropped as much as 2.5%.

The U.S. already blacklisted Huawei last year, preventing American companies from supplying the Chinese company unless they got a license. The latest move tightens those restrictions to prevent chipmakers -- American or foreign -- from working with Huawei and its secretive chip-design unit HiSilicon on the cutting-edge semiconductors they need to make smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration sees Huawei as a dire security threat, an allegation the company denies.

Story continues

“We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a tweet.

Huawei countered by accusing the U.S. of ulterior motives.

“The so-called cybersecurity reasons are merely an excuse,” Richard Yu, head of the Chinese tech giant’s consumer electronics unit wrote in a post to his account on messaging app WeChat. “The key is the threat to the technology hegemony of the U.S” posed by Huawei, he added.

The U.S. decision is likely to hurt not just Huawei and TSMC, but also a clutch of American players including gear-makers Applied Materials Inc., KLA and Lam Research Corp. themselves, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Disruptions to Huawei’s production will also hurt U.S. customers from Micron Technology Inc. and Qorvo Inc. to Texas Instruments Inc., they said. But “it bears repeating that any escalation of trade tensions is negative for the stocks overall,” they wrote in a research report.

It would have been impossible to imagine TSMC becoming such a coveted chit between the world’s great powers when it was founded in 1987. Morris Chang, born in China and trained in the U.S., started the company as a so-called foundry, manufacturing semiconductors for any customer that didn’t want to construct its own fabrication facility, or fab.

At the time, the business wasn’t nearly as glamorous as making chips yourself. Dominating the industry at the time were companies like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which made processors for personal computers. “Real men have fabs,” AMD co-founder Jerry Sanders would say, making clear that was an insult.

But in the intervening years, the foundry industry has become far more strategic for the technology industry. Customers from Apple and Huawei to Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp. have found they can innovate more quickly if they focus on chip designs and then turn to foundries like TSMC to produce them. Innovators in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence or the internet of things also depend on foundries to crack open new markets.

Today, many of the chips for mobile phones, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and any other key technology are made at foundries. TSMC has become the leading foundry in the world by investing heavily in ever more advanced fabs, with annual capital spending of about $16 billion this year.

It can now manufacture at 5 nanometers, about twice the width of human DNA, while China’s top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., or SMIC, is at 14 nanometers. That makes TSMC’s chips far more powerful and energy efficient.

Huawei and HiSilicon will have few good options if they are cut off from TSMC. One possibility is to procure off-the-shelf chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., an option Huawei’s rotating Chairman Eric Xu mentioned in late March. But even that may no longer be viable under the new Commerce restrictions.

SMIC itself is keen on moving up the technology ladder, eyeing a secondary share listing that could raise more than $3 billion on top of a large capital infusion from the state.

But that’s a longer-term endeavor and Huawei’s products meanwhile are likely to suffer, putting them at risk of falling behind those of rivals like Apple or Xiaomi Corp.

For TSMC, it’s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself “everybody’s foundry,” effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry. It supplies Chinese customers like Huawei and the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials and Lam Research.

TSMC did take one step closer to the U.S. last week, saying it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona. The Department of Defense has expressed concern that overseas fabs may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and domestic manufacturing would assure a more reliable supply of chips.

The proposal appears to be carefully calculated to address such security issues without too much damage to profits or its political balancing act. Suppliers to the military, such as Xilinx Inc., would be able to use the U.S. fab, but the facility would likely account for less than 5% of revenue so margins won’t be compromised.

It’s not clear if the plans for a U.S. plant will win TSMC leniency in supplying Huawei, however.

“TSMC will not be granted or granted a license based on their intent to build a 5 nanometer fab here in the United States. That’s not part of it at all,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department, told reporters on a call. “There’s no assurance on that and we don’t anticipate that.”

Meanwhile, China appears to be preparing to retaliate for the new restrictions on Huawei. On Friday, the Global Times -- a Chinese tabloid run by the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party -- reported Beijing was ready to initiate countermeasures, including imposing restrictions on Apple, suspending the purchase of Boeing airplanes and putting U.S. companies on an ‘unreliable entity list.’

The list will cover “foreign entities that cause actual or potential damage to Chinese companies and industries,” the newspaper said.

561,2020-05-15T18:28:03+00:00,Urbem's 'Quality Strategy' Series: Cash Is King,"""Cash is king"" has been one of the most frequently taught lessons throughout the history of our stock market, and it cannot be stressed enough in these times. Indeed, cash flow is the lifeblood of a business and ultimately determines the valuation. How, then, do we gauge the quality of a company from the perspective of cash generation? Here are some of the metrics that we at Urbem find useful to concentrate on.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with NVST. Click here to check it out.  LSE:RMV 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of LSE:RMV Peter Lynch Chart of LSE:RMV

Free cash conversion rate

This ratio measures how much free cash flow a business can generate out of one dollar of earnings and indicates the quality of the company's accounting profit. We generally look for a consistently high figure here year in and year out. It would be very rare for a business to deliver a free cash conversion rate above 100% every year over an extended period of time (e.g., a decade). However, it is certainly possible. Some common scenarios include:

1) The company manages to receive cash payment early from its customers

2) The company manages to pay its suppliers late

3) The company can cover some of its staff costs with non-cash instruments (e.g., stock options).

Scenarios 1 and 2 are strong indicators of a solid business model with strong bargaining power. One example of this is the membership model at Rightmove (LSE:RMV).

CapEx margin

Investors should also be interested in how much capital expenditure is usually required to sustain the operations and expansion at the company. We calculate the CapEx margin as the typical amount of capital expenditure needed to be put back into the business as the percentage of the sales. This way, the metric can be compared with the free cash flow margin.

We look for the CapEx margin to be significantly lower than the free cash flow margin, signaling that the business delivers more cash for its owners than for itself. Take a look at capital-intensive Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), for example, which generates a 10.5% CapEx margin and a 7.4% free cash flow margin, as compared to asset-light Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), which has a 2.4% CapEx margin and an 11.4% free cash flow margin. We thus believe shareholders should be happier with the situation at Domino's, as it keeps less than three cents to itself but allocates more than 11 cents to its shareholders.

Story continues

Cash conversion cycle

This metric expresses the number of days that it takes for a business to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales. The lower the figure, the more efficient the company is concerning cash generation.

Aconsistently negative cash conversion cycle is rare but possible. For instance, it can occur if the business manages to pay its suppliers later than when it gets paid from its customers. Two prominent examples of this model are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Disclosure: The mention of any security in this article does not constitute an investment recommendation. Investors should always conduct careful analysis themselves or consult with their investment advisors before acting in the stock market. We own shares of Rightmove and Domino's Pizza.

562,2020-05-14T18:03:13+00:00,Apple Acquires Startup NextVR that Broadcasts VR Content,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. confirmed it acquired NextVR, a startup that provides sports and other content for virtual-reality headsets.

The acquisition may help Apple’s development of VR and AR headsets with accompanying software and content. NextVR supplies content to several existing VR headsets, including Facebook Inc.’s Oculus and devices from Sony Corp., HTC Corp. and Lenovo.

NextVR has deals with sports leagues including the National Basketball Association and entertainment networks such as Fox Sports. The startup also has expertise in live streaming in virtual reality, which could also be useful for live concerts and games.

The Newport Beach, California-based startup officially shut down this week, saying on its website that it is “heading in a new direction.” Apple said it buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally does not discuss its purpose or plans. It didn’t disclose a purchase price, but website 9to5Mac reported in April that Apple was in talks to buy NextVR for about $100 million.

The deal is at least the third for Apple this year, following the purchase of Voysis, an Irish startup that focuses on voice technology, and Dark Sky, a popular weather app.

563,2020-05-14T08:56:38+00:00,Sony Says It Created World’s First Image Sensor With Built-in AI,"(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. touted on Thursday the world’s first image sensors with built-in artificial intelligence, promising to make data-gathering tasks much faster and more secure. Calling it the first of its kind, Sony said the technology would give “intelligent vision” to cameras for retail and industrial applications.

The new sensors are akin to tiny self-contained computers, incorporating a logic processor and memory. They’re capable of image recognition without generating any images, allowing them to do AI tasks like identifying, analyzing or counting objects without offloading any information to a separate chip. Sony said the method provides increased privacy while also making it possible to do near-instant analysis and object tracking.

Sony joins tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google that have been building dedicated AI silicon to help accelerate everything from image processing to machine learning. Its latest semiconductors could offer a big boost to augmented reality applications, should the technology be adapted for the smartphone or consumer markets, where the Japanese company is a leader.

The new AI-augmented sensors are capable of capturing a regular 12-megapixel image, 4K video at up to 60 frames per second or neither, providing only metadata about what the sensor has seen. Among the applications suggested by Sony are the counting and tracking of visitors to public spaces, heat and congestion mapping and measuring shopper behavior in retail locations.

Though intended for commercial customers in its present iteration, the technology has promise for consumer applications as well. Without generating any actual images, it can help a personal device such as a smartphone identify objects and users securely. The accelerated object detection would also be an advantage for maintaining sharp focus when filming fast-moving subjects such as sports players or pets.

Sony is the world leader in providing image sensors for smartphones such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone and dedicated photo and video cameras from the likes of Nikon Corp. Its sensor division has been its most reliable growth driver over the past few years, boosted by the proliferation of multi-camera phones. The new products are in line with the company’s long-term goal, as articulated by Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida, of expanding the variety of sensing solutions it offers and pursuing more forms of recurring revenue.

Story continues

Sony said it has already shipped samples of its new sensors to potential customers, who are mostly in the business-to-business segment, including factory automation.

564,2020-05-13T12:30:28+00:00,Keep Your Virus News Away From My Ad: Brands Build ‘Blacklists’,"(Bloomberg) -- Readers are flocking to news sites for the latest on Covid-19. Advertisers are running the other way.

As news editors do everything to harness public interest in the worst public health crisis in more than a generation, their main source of income is in freefall, with brands pulling ads from news sites, papers and magazines.

To some extent that’s normal: With businesses hoarding cash just to stay afloat, marketing campaigns are a low priority. But a bad situation is being made a whole lot worse by advertising “blacklists” — sets of keywords that stop ads appearing next to certain categories of news that are considered a turn-off by brand managers. Because so much coverage now touches on coronavirus, one of the biggest stories of the century is turning into an advertising no-go zone.

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a trade group, surveyed U.S. web publishers in early April and found that news organizations were twice as likely to have ads blocked because of keyword blacklisting.

News executives, and even some advertising experts, say the lists can be arbitrary, unfair and often nonsensical: there’s little evidence that readers are less responsive to an ad for shampoo or a car hire service just because they’re sitting alongside a “bad news” story. What’s more, they’re killing news.

“We’re in danger of losing some of the most trusted publishers we have in the U.K. in the coming months,” said Tracey de Groose, executive chairman of British news industry marketing body Newsworks. “The unintended consequence of this is the commercial censorship of journalism.”

Newsworks calculated that Covid-19 blacklists are set to cost British news brands more than 50 million pounds ($61.7 million) in the next three months — a potential lifeline for newsrooms already slashing costs to survive. It said its members already lost 170 million pounds last year from an ever-growing list of common news words that brands avoid, such as “terrorism” and even “Brexit.”

Story continues

Integral Ad Science Inc., one of a complex array of tech firms that influence where ads appear online, said marketers have begun to address the problem — specific coronavirus-related keyword blocking has fallen by 80% since mid-March in the U.S. and 77% in the U.K., according to IAS Chief Executive Officer Lisa Utzschneider. Prior to that, marketers requested blanket bans on ads appearing next to content with words like “coronavirus” or “pandemic.”

In the U.K., news organizations have spent more than a month lobbying ad executives to stop them blocking ads near virus coverage, and even drafted in the government to add its weight to the campaign, to little avail. There’s yet to be any rebound in income for publishers, said de Groose at Newsworks. That’s galling for news sites that have seen readership more than double in some content categories in Europe, according to audience data firm Comscore.

In a follow-up IAB survey last week, 18% of news publishers reported that blacklist restrictions had loosened in their second quarter planning. More than half said nothing had changed.

Companies that provide “brand safety” lists often use outdated terms and obscure how their keyword targeting works, said Nandini Jammi, a marketing industry advocate. “These are not made clear to advertisers,” she said. “Everyone is doing it. No one is thinking about it.”

At the other end of the chain, news publishers struggle to find out which brands are blocking what, making it harder to hold the brands to account. The companies that administer the ad blocking profit from each block, so have little incentive to help.

WPP agency GroupM said it’s trying to get brand marketing teams to making their blacklists more intelligent so more ads reach trusted news sources.

Rather than blocking “Covid-19,” they block a combination of words such as “Covid-19-Miracle Cure” or “Covid-19-Refrigerated Truck” so that ads don’t appear alongside irresponsible or particularly unpleasant news stories, said John Montgomery, the head of GroupM’s global brand safety practice.

“The technology is not the enemy,” he said. “It’s the way we use it.”

Opaque Market

Unpicking the chain of arrangements that are pulling advertising away from news is complex because publishers are the last link in a vast online ecosystem. Digital ads are created by agencies at global companies such as WPP Plc and transmitted via technology platforms including Alphabet Inc.’s Google and intermediaries like IAS and DoubleVerify. An ad flows through a warren of automated marketplaces and is sold a split-second after you click a link to the page where you see it. A myriad of suppliers trade and verify the content, while others gather data to target it better.

It’s turned what used to be a simple agreement between a paper’s ad department and a brand marketing representative into an opaque process that’s dissipated responsibility and accountability.

Google rejects any blame for the boycott of Covid-related news, saying there are no technical or policy reasons to stop publishers monetizing coronavirus-related content on its platforms.

“We are in constant discussions with our publishing partners, advertisers and agencies on how we can continue to support a sustainable future for news,” said a Google spokesperson.

Ad dollars have been draining from the news business for a decade for reasons that reach beyond the pandemic, said Montgomery at GroupM. As the big social media platforms developed sophisticated filters to keep brands safe from harmful or toxic content, they’ve captured more of the ad dollars that once went to news. The result is that “media planners have been trained not to need news any more,” he said.

News organizations such as New York Times Co. and Nikkei Inc.’s Financial Times have cut dependence on ads by moving to reader subscriptions or memberships. Models are also emerging in which tech giants share more revenue, like Apple Inc.’s subscription News+ service or Facebook Inc’s agreement to pay trusted publishers.

Ad-funded news organizations pushed to the brink by the virus-induced ad slump are trying to innovate their way out of danger. Some publishers are pitching ad slots next to “good news” stories from the pandemic, relying on technology that can scan language and find the happier articles.

One of Britain’s biggest newspaper companies, Reach Plc, has teamed up with International Business Machines Corp. and AT&T Inc. to boost its language processing software and direct ads to these stories.

“Coronavirus articles that have a positive sentiment are good for your brand,” said Damon Reeve, chief executive officer of the Ozone Project, an ad platform set up in 2018 by several U.K. news publishers including the Telegraph and the Guardian.

For all those efforts, ad blacklists will be hard to banish as long as there are news themes that brands want to avoid.

“Yes, ‘coronavirus’ has been the number-one blocked keyword,” said IAS’s Utzschneider. “But before that, it was ‘Trump’.”

565,2020-05-13T10:49:58+00:00,"Apple Encourages Chinese Tech Company To Rival Foxconn, Aims To Foster Competition","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has advised aggressive Chinese technology firm, Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd., to make an investment in a Taiwanese metal casing provider, in order to become a rival to Apple’s longtime supplier, Foxconn.

What Happened

Luxshare has been in negotiations for more than a year with Taiwan-based Catcher Technology, the world’s second-largest manufacturer of metal casings, and the discussions have entered a serious phase, according to Nikkei Asian Review.

If negotiations are successful, it would enable Luxshare to manufacture high-quality metal casings, and also open the door for the company to gain expertise in assembly technology.

Investing in Catcher Technology would allow Luxshare to rival Taiwanese assembly giant Foxconn, which is the world’s largest electronics manufacturer and Cupertino's top supplier. Since the first iPhone was released in 2007, Foxconn alone has accounted for 50% of iPhone production, according to the Review.

Why It Matters

The deal involves Catcher’s facilities in China, the expertise of its staff and management, and business opportunities with Apple. The price under negotiation would make this Luxshare’s largest investment, reported the Review.

Metal casings are crucial to the manufacture of high-end smartphones such as iPhones, and the material used determines how well the device is able to connect wirelessly. Foxconn and Pegatron, its smaller rival, have their own metal casing subsidiaries.

For decades, Catcher has been engaged in the production of light metal technology for electronics, and has been a key supplier to Apple for years.

Luxshare is as yet undecided on whether it will make the investment, as iPhone sales peaked in 2018. An executive-level source told the Review, “Will the iPhone business be as profitable in the next 10 years as it was in the past decade? No one can guarantee the return of this investment.”

Price Action

Apple shares traded 0.77% lower at $309 in the after-hours session on Tuesday. The shares had closed the regular session 1.14% lower at $311.41.

566,2020-05-12T10:43:29+00:00,Not Just Fun And Games: How Esports Could Offer Potential Investment Opportunities,"Like to play Fortnite or League of Legends? You’re in good company, because esports have become hugely popular. And esports investing and esports stocks have benefited.

Gaming and esports have grown rapidly—driven by consumer demand, new distribution strategies, and new technology, according to research firm GlobalData. Gaming has transformed into a service model rather than just a product model. As that interest has grown, so has interest in esports investing.

Like everything else, esports have been affected by the sudden, global spread of the novel coronavirus. ESPN.com reported that dozens of live esports tournaments, such as Dota Pro Circuit, have been canceled or postponed indefinitely. Some events that were supposed to be held in stadiums, such as League of Legends, have moved online to support social distancing guidelines.

The Meteoric Rise of Esports

Before the global outbreak of COVID-19, games and esports analytics firm Newzoo forecast that global esports would top $1 billion in 2020 for the first time, with China being the top market and North America close behind. That’s an estimated year-on-year growth of 15.7% for 2020. The firm has yet to update those figures, but they’ll likely change.

At the time, China was expected to be the largest market by revenue, with total revenues of $385.1 million in 2020, followed by North America, with total revenues of $252.8 million, the firm estimated.

Industry watchers will wait and see how the cancellations of some games and the move to put other tournaments online will affect the business. Online platforms such as Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and YouTube, owned by Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), are making it easier for people to consume esports videos and events by allowing esports streamers to broadcast gameplay, according to Influencer Marketing Hub. The firm cited data from TwitchTracker, which shows Twitch has seen an increase in the number of people who watch live streams on the platform—rising to 1.28 million in 2019 from 591,809 in 2016.

Story continues

MarTech Series, citing a late March report by GlobalData, sees streaming platforms benefiting from this push to online viewing. Brands that advertise during esports games—such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)—and have hosted esports events for years will likely increase their online ad buys and shift some of the ad spending they could have done at in-person tournaments. That shift in support might benefit the streaming platforms, while the organizers of these games may see their ad revenues fall sharply.

Before the virus outbreak, consulting group McKinsey & Co. noted that brands such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) were getting into core sponsorship. Advertisers have discovered that esports could be an even more attractive branding medium than traditional sports thanks to the interactivity of livestreaming. McKinsey noted that so far, there are few ads, so there’s not too much competition. Streamers are willing to wear, consume, and endorse sponsors’ products while broadcasting.

Depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it’s possible that the media rights these platforms buy from organizers could rise sharply in coming years. So these platforms may try to strike long-term deals with event organizers, GlobalData explained.

How to Invest in Esports

Even though COVID-19 has upended the sector, gaming doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. There are a few ways to invest in esports, whether directly in esports stocks or ETFs, or indirectly through technology firms or brands big in the space.

Citing data from the third quarter of 2019, Newzoo said that the top 10 public companies by games revenue made a combined $21.5 billion, which is a year-on-year growth of 7.5%, slightly higher than the growth rate in the first half of 2019. However, it was under the 11% growth rate seen year-over-year.

Newzoo said the companies that saw the greatest year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2019 included GOOGL, Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), Tencent Holdings, Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTWO). TTWO saw 74% year-over-year growth, with revenues rising to nearly $1 billion. It was the third quarter’s fastest grower, while growth numbers for GOOGL and AAPL over the past 12 months through the quarter were 28% and 16%, respectively.

GlobalData reported that much of the innovation is coming through companies involved in 5G, cloud gaming, and the artificial reality/virtual reality space. Many semiconductor companies have hands in those high-growth interrelated areas, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX). And don’t forget cloud computing platforms. In addition to AMZN and GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a significant platform.

In the March report reflecting the pandemic’s impact, GlobalData pointed out that online viewership of esports tournaments has grown significantly. The research firm cited information supplied by Gen.G that it saw an 18% increase in viewership for its PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and League of Legends teams on Chinese streaming platforms in early 2020, when the Chinese government locked down most of the country.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's live market coverage. Now, the coronavirus outbreak has upended US equities trading. The New York Stock Exchange has closed its trading floor, and the NASDAQ has closed its option floor in Philadelphia. Now, all of this happening, of course, as we've seen market volatility spikes.

So let's get more on this. And for that, we have Nelson Griggs, president of the NASDAQ stock exchange. And Nelson, thanks so much for taking the time to join the show this afternoon. We're excited to have you on. I guess let's start with-- give us a sense of what the last two months have been like with your entire operations working remotely.

NELSON GRIGGS: Sure, well thanks for having me. So historically, we are about a 4% work from home and very quickly went to a 98% work from home. If you think about the exchange's responsibility, though, we have been through shutdowns before over Sandy, et cetera. But most of the BCP planning, the backup planning, is thought about in terms of days and weeks, not globally for months. So we did very quickly put plans in place. We were pretty early on this because of what we saw happening with our operations in Hong Kong.

So we have been incredibly resilient, I think not just NASDAQ but the entire Street. I think we all feared the worst, in terms of what it would be like to work from home. And it has been really-- from a market operations, obviously there's a lot of volatility, but it's been really seamless.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, can you talk about-- I mean, at a time when there's so much uncertainty and there's so much volatility in the markets, it's spooking a lot of investors out there. What kind of relief measures are you providing to listed companies at this point?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think the one thing that comes up in times like this, and we saw this as well in the financial crisis, is companies that are on what we call more of the smaller cap end of the range, concerned about rules around having that minimum dollar bid price, minimum market values. And the SEC has been great to work with. Both ourselves as well as the competing exchanges have come up with plans that have been very-- the SEC has been very receptive to give temporary relief for those companies with the idea is that this is probably more of a temporary downturn and then we'll come back. And we saw that in the financial crisis.

Story continues

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Nelson, you talk about the fact that it could be a temporary downturn. We have shifted our focus almost, or I guess the direction of our conversation recently, talking about people getting back to work, the return to work here, and the potential return to-- I don't know if we want to put it in quotes, but what normalcy will look like going forward. What do you think that could look like?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think what's interesting to us is-- so we do operate in over 30 countries. So it is a very country by country, even-- and then you get to the US, it's state by state. There's a lot of local regulations and rules to figure out about what we actually can do with our employee base. So it's going to be gradual.

We are fortunate. Our business is very resilient, so we're not forced to go back early, by any means. But our hope is that we see gradual returning to work with a lot of precautionary measures around temperature testing, social distancing. The biggest thing to figure out early are transportation-- public transportation and how do you get a workforce to work?

So it's a daily call we have with our executive leadership team to talk about how that could look, but I think we all have to be understanding that it's going to take some time and it's going to be gradual and we should expect it to be-- you know, have a bit of a lumpy effect.

SEANA SMITH: Hey Nelson, so when we talk about returning to work, some of the questions I guess that have been raised I've been reading about is whether or not US exchange trading floors are still going to be relevant post-coronavirus. I know the NASDAQ in particular, it's mostly remote trading. You mostly do it all online. But what are your thoughts on that, just in terms of what we could expect going forward and what will be necessary going forward?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think we'd separate the equities market from the options market. There's unique components of the options market. We still see value in a floor. But it's pretty clear during this time with the equities market, most of the volume today is happening away from a floor environment, as is we measure the quality of trading. And we do feel that NASDAQ does electronic trading the best in the world. But electronic trading better serves investors because there's not really that conflict of interests that we see in the floor-based models for equities.

So you know, we'll see how the floor-based markets-- there's really only one left, how it comes back. But I think at this time, investors are actually being served very well with tight spreads, liquidity, and we're seeing the markets operate very, very efficiently.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, I want to hear your thoughts on the IPO market because it's come to nearly a standstill over the last several weeks. So how do you think-- or how has coronavirus reshaped the 2020 IPO timeline?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, well, it certainly has reshaped it. It hasn't come to a complete stop. We have had six health care companies, biotechs go public, and we do believe we'll have more. And there actually is a small pipeline developing of companies that were on the cusp of going public in February and March that still have an active dialogue going about a June, July timeframe.

But clearly, the biggest challenge for a companies when you do go public is you need to forecast your-- you know, your financials for the remainder of the year, the coming year, and that's gotten very hard for many businesses. So we still think there can be an IPO market.

That's part of the reason why you see health care being successful is because the lack of need for forecasting. They're talking about, you know, two years, four years, five years down the road for developing drugs. But we do think we'll start seeing the IPO market open up a bit in June, July, August, but be fairly slow. And then we do think it'll pick up more robustly as the year progresses. There's a lot of companies would like to go.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Nelson, you mentioned the fact that you've had six companies go public. How are you facilitating those virtual IPOs. What exactly does that process look like at this point?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, that's a great question. So as mentioned, we've been incredibly impressed with our partners, the trading firms, the banks that do trade through NASDAQ. So they can really operate as they do today. NASDAQ operates, as we always have-- we provide a very robust tools-- toolkit to companies, investors to go public-- or sorry, the trading desks. And we have our team that does that. So that that's been very, very fluid.

The challenge for companies is if you think about what a roadshow used to be, it used to be going for eight days to all these different cities on planes. And now it's usually been four days on video. But I would say the deals that have come out have all been received very, very well. They've traded well. And I think that companies were able to get their message across, you know, clearly enough to drive that investor demand, so different but also surprisingly successful.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, real quick, in your line of work as the president of the NASDAQ stock exchange, you talk to a lot of executives because it's in your line of business. What are you hearing from these CEOs? What are you hearing from these executives, just about their outlook over the next couple of months?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, and I think we look-see a little bit that's developing actually in the market in performance. It clearly has been a market where technology, health care have done very well. The averages there-- the NASDAQ 100, the NASDAQ composite, the biotech-- are actually positive now for the year. Clearly, value stocks in certain sectors have been hit very hard.

So I think you do need to look at the market, look at companies on a very individualist basis. What does their sector look like? But clearly, everyone says a lot of consistent themes. They think about their employees, their health, their safety and well-being.

And then depending on which side of the market they're on, it's either how do I accelerate through this and find new opportunities? For some, they're thinking about, OK, I need to really conserve cash, find cash, and prepare myself for, you know, a handful more quarters or even a year or so, what's going to be a slower market for their businesses.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Nelson Griggs, president of the NASDAQ stock exchange, thanks so much for joining me today.

568,2020-05-07T01:56:00+00:00,Apple Maintains Lead After Smartwatches Defy Global Sales Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. again commanded a majority share of the smartwatch market in the first quarter, when the Covid-19 outbreak encouraged health tracking and drove a 20% rise in shipments.

Global smartwatch shipments reached 13.7 million units in the first three months of this year, defying a worldwide slump in consumer electronics arenas such as mobile phones. Apple’s share inched up a percentage point to 55.5%, according to Strategy Analytics.

The Apple Watch is seen as one of the key growth drivers for the U.S. company, which has stopped detailing quarterly iPhone shipments as the smartphone market matures. Compal Electronics Inc. and Quanta Computer Inc. are the Cupertino, California giant’s assembly partners for the wearable device, according to GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu.

Strategy Analytics notes that Apple achieved its highest market share in two years after shipping 7.6 million units. Samsung Electronics Co. was second with 1.9 million and Garmin Ltd. rounded out the top three with 1.1 million.​

​“We expect global smartwatch shipments to slow sharply in the second quarter of 2020, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” said Woody Oh, a director at Strategy Analytics. “However, the second half of this year and beyond will see a decent rebound, as consumers worldwide steadily regain confidence and more retail stores reopen.”

569,2020-05-06T22:00:36+00:00,Crazy Trading on China's Nasdaq Has Its Own Logic,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Old habits die hard. China’s Nasdaq-like ChiNext board has staged a comeback this year, rallying 17% to trade at an average of — yes, really — 70 times earnings. Is this misguided enthusiasm by an investor base that infamously engineered a stomach-churning crash just five years ago?

All the conventional wisdom points to irrationality. The ChiNext is composed mostly of young, small and volatile enterprises, whereas blue chips are far better placed to weather the coronavirus outbreak. First-quarter earnings reports from China’s domestically listed companies just drove home the point.

The data show an irrefutable connection between market value and earnings resilience. Companies with a market cap of more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) increased their sales and operating profit at the median, despite the virus-related lockdowns. By contrast, the median smaller company recorded a double-digit decline in earnings.

What’s surprising, though, is that not all earnings for ChiNext members are bad. The new-economy market is a story of ice and fire. While more than half of companies reported a drop in net income, almost a quarter posted earnings growth of at least 30%. In other words, performance was either sub-zero or very hot, with little in between.

That makes the ChiNext an attractive market for stock pickers who fancy they can pick the hot prospects from the frozen waste. This makes sense for investors, since China has no equivalent of the FANGs — the mega-cap technology stocks that have made the U.S. equity market the world’s best performer. In China, the well-loved large caps are in booze and drugs — and these are already richly valued and crowded.

A case in point is Kweichow Moutai Co., maker of the fiery liquor known as baijiu and the world’s most valuable distiller. Moutai’s 1.6 trillion yuan market value is now equal to the entire gross domestic product of Guizhou province, where the company is based. How much upside can there be left for an alcohol producer whose basic product costs just shy of 2,400 yuan, or close to $340 a a bottle? That’s more than the minimum monthly wage in China’s capital, Beijing. Unlike FANG members Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc., Moutai surely can't be considered a play on middle-class consumption.

Story continues

Chinese investors also have a different vision of value. For them, value isn’t about cheap metrics such as low price-to-book or price-earnings ratios. Rather, it’s determined by how fast a small cap can morph into a blue chip. This explains why investors love Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., which supplies batteries to Tesla Inc. They hope it can become as indispensable to Elon Musk’s electric-car maker as Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. did to Apple Inc.

To be sure, this is all risky business. Beijing recently approved plans to move to a registration-based system for initial public offerings on ChiNext. That means a flood of new companies with even less vetting will be arriving on the board. It’s also worth noting that the quarterly earnings of these young and inexperienced companies aren’t audited.

But then traders on ChiNext aren’t buying stocks so much as options. They’re sifting for China’s future FANGs.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Let's get to more on today's moves, and for that we have Anastasia Amoroso at JP Morgan Private Bank, Head of Cross-Asset Thematic Strategy.

Anastasia, thanks so much for taking the time to rejoin the show. I want to start with what we talked about the last time you were on. It was just about a month ago you were on. You were talking about that there is no doubt that we would see this drop in Q2 GDP and that we were at least going to have some sort of a technical recession.

So the question now is, how deep and how long of a recession we could see? What are you thinking at this point?

ANASTASIA AMOROSO: That's right. So the view that we're going to have a very deep recession is certainly playing out, as some of the data that we're getting suggests that the drops are really significant.

But what I would submit to you is that although, obviously, things like initial jobless claims and unemployment rate and manufacturing numbers are very important to see what's happening on the ground right now, if we look into the future, and if we look at how quickly can we see a rebound, what becomes more important is real-time, real-world data. Because some of the data that we're now getting is the backwards-looking view of what happened over the last month. And you and I know that what's going to happen in the next month, hopefully, is going to be pretty vastly different.

So we're looking to things like the mobility reports that tell us, is the traffic to the physical grocery stores, to retail, is it starting to pick up? We're looking at things like TSA lines, are they starting to get a little bit longer, just a little bit? And I do want to say that there's definitely parts of the economy where we're seeing no pickup in activity whatsoever, such as restaurants and movie theaters. Not a surprise. But we're seeing very minuscule, I will say, but nevertheless pickups in economic activity, just judging from some of the mobility reports.

Story continues

So this is going to be the story to watch for the next, really, couple of months as more and more states open up, and we'll get this sense of how many of them are resuming economic activity and how quickly.

SEANA SMITH: And Anastasia, going off of that mobility report, it's really interesting, because we talk about the fact that these states are reopening, but take a look at what we've seen just in Texas over the last couple of days. And there was reports, I think there was one in the Wall Street Journal today, talking about the fact that so many of their retail shops are still not seeing the uptick in traffic that many economists, many analysts, were hoping that we would see over the first coming days, as we begin to see states reopening.

So when we take that into account and what exactly that could mean for a potential rebound, and how long it could take until we see a significant rebound, how are you reading that?

ANASTASIA AMOROSO: Yeah, it's going to take a while. You can appreciate psychologically, after the last six weeks or two months of lockdowns, it's going to take a little bit of nudging and a little bit of confidence, which comes with time, before people really turn up at the stores and the restaurants. But if we think about it, not only what's going to happen over the next one week, but what's going to happen over the next six weeks or even over the next two months, I think that's really the most material thing.

I suspect that over the next two months, May and June, we're going to see a recovery in the level of activity. Not back to 100%, maybe not even back to 90%, but maybe somewhere around the 80% range. So as that happens, that's what's really key for the markets, is to make sure that the economy comes back largely online by June, because that's what's currently being reflected in consensus expectations.

SEANA SMITH: Anastasia, it's interesting. I was reading your latest note, and in there, you were talking about how AI and big data, how they're helping to fight the spread of COVID-19. What are some of the trends you're seeing there, and then from an investor's perspective, how can you act on some of those trends?

ANASTASIA AMOROSO: Yeah, absolutely. AI and big data are absolutely front and center, and frankly, this is why you see such a massive leadership of big tech companies. Because a lot of them capitalize on really critical trends at the moment, which is the shift to the cloud, so that's why some of the tech names are leading.

But with this shift to the cloud, more and more companies are also implementing AI capabilities with it. So with the cloud comes AI, and with all of that comes the focus on cloud security. So that's why we see names in the tech sector lead the way here.

The other trend that is absolutely top of mind for us here is AI and how it relates to health care, and more so, the innovation that is happening in the biotech space. Biotech, as you know, has period of performance where it does really well, but if you look at in the last five years, it has actually not done well at all. It's been sideways.

But what I think we're on the cusp of right now is seen as significant payoff. And all this money that went into R&D, that's actually starting to materialize in new treatment approvals, and that's going to ramp up significantly over the next several years. That, I think, is not fully reflected in the valuations of some of these biotech names, and that's where I would be looking to put those extra dollars to work.

SEANA SMITH: Anastasia, what about some of the big tech names? I know it doesn't exactly fit into what you were just talking about, but some of the big names like Apple, for example, Google. They're coming up with ways to assist in the contact tracing and trying to help other ways, just in terms of mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Are you seeing any investment opportunities in some of those bigger tech names?

ANASTASIA AMOROSO: Absolutely. It is actually stunning what they're doing in order to help with the contact tracing and perhaps predicting the future spread of the virus like that. So we would definitely look to those names, because as you know, it's definitely very difficult to open up the economy without having some of those tools in place.

And by the way, one of the reasons why countries like China, like South Korea, like Taiwan, why they were able to in certain cases contain this a whole lot quicker is because they did implement a whole lot of technology to solve this problem. So that's why you see the resiliency in some of those names.

And then the other reason is a lot of this is playing out in the cloud. As enterprises and consumers look to boost our digital resiliency, we now have enterprises accelerate how much money they're going to be spending on transition to the cloud. And that was a big trend that was already in place. Now, I think we'll pull that forward, and once again it adds to the resiliency of those names.

SEANA SMITH: Anastasia, real quick, I just want to get your take on earnings, what we've seen so far. So while we have seen a huge drop-off from what we were initially expecting going back to the beginning of the year, in a lot of instances, the earnings report have not been as bad as what we initially expected.

How are you reading what we're seeing so far, and what we could expect here over the next couple of weeks?

ANASTASIA AMOROSO: Yeah, it's been a very lackluster earnings season to say the least. And what we're seeing now is fewer companies at typical earnings. That's understandable, of course. But also, while the average surprise is usually a positive one, we're not seeing that this time around. So this is why, going into the earnings season, we were expecting to see a bit of a downside or at least sideways markets, because earnings were not going to move the needle for companies.

But the exception to that, of course, is the companies that have managed to beat estimates should be rewarded. I will say they're not being rewarded to the same extent as we would expect them to in this sort of environment, but nevertheless tech and health care, as you've mentioned, are outperforming here.

The other thing that really is largely offsetting some of the lackluster earnings season, which I think we're going to continue to see here, is obviously the hopes about the reopening of the economy. So those are the two factors that the markets are balancing right now.

SEANA SMITH: All right. Anastasia Amoroso, JP Morgan Private Bank, thanks so much for taking the time to join us again.

Vanguard should probably be thanking Warren Buffett.

In Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) 2014 shareholder letter, Buffett mentioned Vanguard funds in a big way.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Specifically, he recommended that the cash left to his wife be invested 10% in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. Not just any index fund mind you, but a Vanguard fund in particular.

Whether it be exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds, the Oracle of Omaha believes Vanguard funds are the way to go. With that in mind, I’ve put together a portfolio of two ETFs, two mutual funds and a fifth wildcard. The resulting portfolio should be appropriate for Buffett’s wife — or anyone else, for that matter.

Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX)

Allocation: 50% of Portfolio
10-Year Performance: 10.49%

The goal is to keep costs to a minimum while generally sticking to Buffett’s hypothesis when it comes to his wife’s investments. Although Vanguard does offer commission-free ETFs, I recommend a mutual fund for the S&P 500 investment.

The Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VFIAX) charges an annual expense ratio of just 0.04%, or $4 on a $10,000 investment.

Your annual fees would amount to a mere $20 on a $50,000 portfolio. That’s hard to beat, and Buffett knows it. The largest holdings in this fund include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The minimum investment is $3,000.

Allocation: 20% of Portfolio 10-Year Performance: 9.94%

The VFIAX covers the large-capitalization portion of the portfolio quite nicely.

While Buffett might not be fond of mid-cap stocks being added to the mix, evidence suggests mid-caps outperformed large-cap stocks over a four-year period between 2009 and 2013.

In fact, John Hancock published a report cautioning investors about underweighting mid-caps because of an assumption that a large-cap fund combined with a small-cap fund will do the job. That’s simply not the case.

Mid-cap stocks tend to provide an attractive combination of risk and reward. For this reason, I recommend the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX), which tracks the CRSP Mid Cap Index, an index composed of stocks that fall between the top 70%-85% of investable market capitalization.

They’re big enough to survive an economic hit but small enough to still be growing. With an expense ratio of 0.05%, this entry on our list of Vanguard funds is giving you safety and performance in one. Top holdings include Newmont (NYSE:NEM), Centene (NYSE:CNC) and TransDigm (NYSE:TDG).

Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (VSS)</b> Take Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy

Allocation: 10% of Portfolio 10-Year Performance: 6.67%

Although I just said mid-cap stocks are a key part of any portfolio and tend to outperform small-caps while utilizing less risk, there is always a place for small-caps in your portfolio.

That’s especially true when the two previous picks from Vanguard Funds are almost 100% invested in the U.S. with virtually no international exposure. For this reason, a little bit of love outside America makes total sense.

My recommendation is to go with the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:VSS), a fund that tracks the performance of the FTSE Global Small Cap ex US Index, which consists of over 3,000 stocks in dozens of countries. Investing in both developed and emerging markets, the fund provides good exposure to some of the world’s future stars at an annual expense ratio of just 0.12%.

With such low fees, it’s no wonder  $6.8 billion is invested in this ETF.

Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)</b> Take Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy

Allocation: 10% of Portfolio  5-Year Performance: 1.33%

Buffett recommends that 10% of his wife’s portfolio go to short-term government bonds. Vanguard Funds has an ETF that does exactly that.

The Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (NASDAQ:VGSH) invests in investment-grade U.S. government bonds with average maturities between one and three years. The risk, on a scale of one to five, is one — meaning this Vanguard ETF is for conservative investors looking for stable share prices.

And with an expense ratio of 0.05%, this ETF should give you peace of mind for your short-term needs.

Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC)</b>

Allocation: 10% of Portfolio  10-Year Performance: 10.67%

On this final piece of the puzzle, I’m going defensive. The mutual fund version of the S&P 500 has less than 10% invested in consumer staples. I mean to remedy that by putting the final 10% in the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC), a collection of 92 household names including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).

Since its inception in 2004, VDC has had but one year of negative annual total returns, and that was in 2008 when it experienced a 17% decline — 20 percentage points better than the S&P 500. When the you-know-what hits the fan, you’ll be glad you own this particular low-cost ETF. It has an expense ratio of just 0.10%.

It seems the “keep it simple” rule holds true, and Warren Buffett is the No. 1 follower.

As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not own a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

573,2020-04-30T19:48:09+00:00,Tesla turns negative after David Einhorn questions billing practices,"Yahoo Finance’s Emily McCormick joins Seana Smith to break down why short-seller David Einhorn is questioning Tesla's billing practices.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Tesla shares reversing and are now down more than 4%. Now this comes despite the fact that the company revealed a surprise profit in the first quarter.

For more on this, we have Emily McCormick in. Emily, it's a little bit interesting when you take a look at the stock performance today. We were up over 4%, now down in the red, off over 4%. Why are we seeing a reversal so far today?

EMILY MCCORMICK: Well, Seana, we did have some news come out partway through today's session. We had David Einhorn, the president of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, challenging Tesla's billing practices in an open letter to Elon Musk posted on Twitter earlier today. He specifically took issue with Tesla's accounts receivable, particularly since Tesla still posted solid results even though the company likely saw sales lower at the end of the quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic, and that's usually the part of the quarter that Tesla relies on to really see a bump for quarterly results overall.

So that call-- getting that called into question is something that really sparked the reversal that we're seeing. The stock had been up more than 8% during the overnight session and earlier on around market open, and that was because of these much better results that we saw for the first quarter. So that was a first-quarter profit that had been unexpected as well as an about 30% rise in sales to nearly $6 billion.

We did see free cash flow about negative $895 million. But for at least the overnight session, that was something that the Street wasn't as focused on. Really, there had been a lot of optimism around the ramp of the Model Y, the fact that we had automotive gross margins improving to 25 and 1/2% in the first quarter, which was an improvement versus just about 23% over last year. And still a pretty good margin at 20% even when you exclude those regulatory credits.

Story continues

So an interesting story that we've seen play out between the earnings, the David Einhorn challenge this afternoon, and then now seeing the stock down about 4%.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Emily, I want to ask about the coronavirus impact that that's going to have on Tesla. Do you have any more information about that? Because it was interesting just in terms of what Elon Musk was saying about-- when he was asked about a potential slowdown. He said it was still pedal to the metal on new products and also plans for expanding the company.

EMILY MCCORMICK: Right. Well, Elon Musk did give a rather colorful earnings call yesterday after market close. He called the coronavirus social-distancing measures akin to, quote, ""forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights."" He later conflated it with fascism. So he definitely didn't have a lot of positive things to say about the coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures that have emerged because of it.

Now, Tesla did have to shut down its Fremont factory, its flagship Fremont auto facility, at the end of the day starting March 23. So that's been a weeks-long closure that is really threatening Tesla when it comes to those delivery goals that it had at the beginning of the year. In January, Tesla said it had hoped to-- or it believed it would comfortably exceed 500,000 vehicle deliveries this year, although analysts are now saying that that's much more unlikely given the nature of the pandemic and the way that it's impacted both the supply chain and demand for autos overall.

574,2020-04-28T01:25:11+00:00,"Google, Starbucks, AMD earnings: What to know in markets Tuesday","Earnings season kicks into high gear Tuesday. A slew of big names will deliver quarterly results, but the spotlight will be on Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) after the closing bell.

Alphabet is expected to report adjusted earnings of $13.97 per share on $32.56 billion in revenue during its first quarter. The tech giant’s results could be negatively impacted by its exposure to the travel industry, which accounts for approximately 11% of search and revenue. Ad revenue will have likely taken a hit amid COVID-19, but Alphabet’s cloud business could remain a bright spot, according to analysts.

“We believe Street estimates for Q1 are likely optimistic, given the material pullback in ad spend due to COVID-19. Management commentary on near-term Ad Revenue outlook will be key,” RBC analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note April 24.

So far this year, Alphabet shares are down 4%, while the broader market declined 10%. In the same period, Facebook (FB) sank 6%, Netflix (NFLX) soared 31%, Amazon (AMZN) jumped 30% and Apple (AAPL) fell 3%.

Coffee giant Starbucks is estimated to report adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share on $5.90 billion in revenue during its fiscal second quarter.

Starbucks provided a business update on April 8 and outlined the impact that it had seen as a result of COVID-19. At the time, the company said that same-store sales in the U.S. during the quarter fell 3% and same-store sales in the last week of March declined 60% to 70%. Meanwhile, sales tanked 50% in China during the quarter, according to the company.

Last week, Starbucks announce that it would be offering Beyond Meat (BYND) products in China. Shares of the coffee chain are down 11% this year.

Finally, chipmaker AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings of 18 cents per share on $1.79 billion in revenue during its first quarter. While COVID-19 likely hit AMD’s PC and gaming chip businesses, data center CPU & GPU sales to cloud customers probably benefited this year.

Story continues

“Tailwinds [for AMD] include strong cloud demand, low exposure to enterprise, and resurgent gaming,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note April 27. “Risks include 2H PC/console pull-ins/delays. However, AMD's smaller footprint in PC's (15% share) and competitive new products mitigates PC risk, in our view. On consoles, while a delayed launch is possible, demand should be fine, given major spec upgrades, and a re-invigorated/re-engaged gaming demographic.”

Other major earnings reports scheduled for Tuesday include PepsiCo (PEP), Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM), Pfizer (PFE), DR Horton (DHI), Harley-Davidson (HOG), UPS (UPS), Southwest Airlines (LUV) before market open; Mondelez (MDLZ), Ford (F) after market close.

575,2020-04-27T23:00:14+00:00,China in Africa Is More Than a Land Grab,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China has plenty to gain from lending a hand to its friends battling the coronavirus in Africa. Contrary to some perceptions, that won't mean opportunistic grabs in oil, copper or arable land. The biggest prize for Beijing is political capital.

Sub-Saharan Africa faces its first recession in 25 years, and the continent as a whole is also grappling with the oil price crash and weakened currencies that have devastated state budgets. As a result of the Ebola outbreak that began in 2014, nations are better prepared than before. Still, health services are sorely inadequate, built around global financing and donor interests rather than coherent domestic policy, says Osman Dar, medical consultant and project director with Chatham House’s Global Health Programme. Barely a fifth of countries in Africa have free, universal care. The Central African Republic had three ventilators for a population of 5 million before the crisis; a handful of nations had none.

China is Africa’s largest trading partner and creditor, and Beijing moved swiftly to provide aid as the virus spread. It delivered tests, protective equipment and ventilators, assisted by the foundation of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma. More remarkably, China endorsed a temporary freeze on debt payments agreed upon by the Group of 20 economies — unusual for a country that tends to prefer bilateral efforts. The scale and breadth of the current shock may have played a part in that decision, according to Lauren Johnston of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.

The soft-power push hasn’t gone smoothly. Parts of the continent’s civil society are still seething after videos circulated on social media this month showing discrimination against Africans in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. They have been forcibly tested, barred from restaurants and even evicted from homes, causing public outrage back home. The heavy-handed measures to tackle a cluster of coronavirus cases in Guangzhou, which has a significant population of African traders and students, fed an underlying distrust and risked undoing the gains of mask diplomacy.

Story continues

Beijing can still take advantage and obtain what matters to China: political allies in the United Nations, where Africa accounts for more than a quarter of member states, and clout that in turn influences its relations with great powers. Efforts have already paid off relative to far more expensive gambits, like its rapprochement with Pakistan. Given the pandemic, collapsing oil, a disinterested U.S. and a distracted Europe, it can do so more cheaply than ever.

To be clear, mineral riches and mercantile interests do matter. China’s companies are eyeing a young, growing population of 1.3 billion consumers. Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Co., a mobile-phone maker focused on Africa, priced its 2019 initial public offering in Shanghai at a price-earnings valuation twice that of Apple Inc. Telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. does brisk business there.

Even so, Africa represents less than 5% of Beijing’s $4 trillion of annual global trade. The real great game is about securing a Chinese candidate at the head of the Food and Agriculture Organization; getting a friendly one at the World Health Organization; and landing the country’s first overseas military base. Considering more countries attended President Xi Jinping’s 2018 African summit than the UN General Assembly held a few weeks later, there’s plenty to build on.

What happens next will center on debt. China’s government, banks and contractors extended more than $150 billion to Africa’s governments and state-owned enterprises between 2010 and 2018, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University. Angola alone accounted for almost a third of that, CARI’s Deborah Brautigam wrote recently.

China forgives plenty of African loans, though usually small amounts. Relief is generally accompanied by more credit. It prefers to renegotiate, and will probably do so here. There won’t be a splurge. Chinese overseas loan-making plateaued or even dipped of late, and there’s little to suggest that caution will ease, even if state support for China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China means there is room for more.

Importantly, land grabs won’t be part of the equation. China has in the past used credit to get production rights, say, in Angola. But there is no substantial evidence, either in lending reviewed by CARI or in research done by Rhodium Group, that the country seizes strategic assets from debtors. Sri Lanka’s precarious levels of debt, which ultimately led to the concession of a strategic port, had deeper roots than China’s loans.

Take Zambia, currently battling Western miners and struggling with debt. The government may want a quick debt-for-equity fix, but it’s unclear Beijing would be so keen. Why trade a small economic gain for political ignominy? Even China’s commodity-backed loans have rarely been easy to act on.

Finally, negotiations won’t be easy. Despite talk that China is engaging in debt-trap diplomacy from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and others, borrowers can and do push back, especially when new governments come in. Malaysia did in 2018, and the public anger of African ministers over Guangzhou points to similar agency.

Timing is more complicated. Africa needs cash, but big-bang assistance packages may have to wait. Beijing attributes huge importance to its African summit, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, due to be held next year in Dakar. At the 2018 edition, China announced $60 billion of aid and loans to great fanfare.

There are plenty of unknowns, not least around how China’s own faltering economy and domestic sentiment will affect its ability to lend. The UN has called for $200 billion for health assistance and economic help for Africa — a fraction of what the G-20 countries and China will spend at home. Aid could pay rich dividends. A friend in need, after all, is a friend indeed.

Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley joins Seana Smith to discuss.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Let's talk about Apple. The company is reportedly delaying mass production of its 2020 flagship iPhones. Now the Wall Street Journal's saying that it'll be pushed back by just around a monthly. We have Dan Howley here with us to discuss this story.

And Dan, you and I have talked about in the past, we've heard rumors and the fact that Apple could potentially delay some of its new iPhones. Wall Street Journal now saying that this will, in fact, happen just in terms of production being pushed off. How significant do you think this is? Because I think a lot of the investor excitement for this year's 5G release was really what helped send Apple shares to record highs earlier this year.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, this is already basically built into the stock price, the 5G iPhone. And I think the expectation that it may not launch on time as well has been priced, and I think the issue for Apple would be how long of a delay it could be. Now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that it would be about a month off of the normal schedule for when it would be released as a result of mass production, issues related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic.

We were previously discussing with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives about Apple potentially putting off the unveiling of the device itself. Usually, what happens is you see a new iPhone come out around the September 12th, second week of September time frame. And then the device itself comes out two weeks later, and then you have that continued push of buyers up until the holidays, where you get the real huge uplift. And then that continues into the first half of the year and then slowly trickles off as a newer iPhone comes out that next September.

But if they end up pushing it off, I think really what you're going to see is just built up anticipation for this device. And then when they do have it released fully, can Apple keep up with that anticipation? Because this will be the first 5G device reportedly that Apple is expected to release, and that will be a hot seller, especially with all the hype around 5G.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-delays-mass-production-2020-192837024.html?.tsrc=rss,"['$E@EMCF.US', '0E7A.DU', '0J2X.XETRA', '0P00000PQH.F', '0P0000WN2O.LSE', '1096.HK', '58F178.KO', '6824.TSE', '91USC.NX', '9A90B.NX', '9E91B.NX', 'A50HZ.NX', 'AAPL.BA', 'AAPL.MI', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.SN', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL.VI', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AAPLC.BA']","['APPLE', 'DAN HOWLEY', 'MASS PRODUCTION', 'WALL STREET JOURNAL']","{'polarity': 0.895, 'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.056}"
577,2020-04-27T17:28:42+00:00,Why nobody on Wall Street really cares that Apple is reportedly delaying new iPhone releases,"If you’re Apple (AAPL), it pays to have gobs of cash and a gazillion plugged in sell-side analysts obsessively covering your stock. That’s especially so right now amidst a global health pandemic that has crushed the global economy and has made buying a new $1,000-plus iPhone sometime this year seem silly (if not financially impossible for many).

Shares of the tech behemoth barely budged on Monday following a story in the Wall Street Journal that Apple would push back the production of its latest iPhones by roughly a month. Apple typically releases several new handsets in the fall just before the holiday shopping season.

The company is reportedly working on four new iPhones for release this year, some with 5G capability.

Two Apple spokesmen didn’t return Yahoo Finance’s request for comment on the WSJ report.

At first blush, one would think news of a delay of any kind for fresh iPhones would be negative to Apple’s stock price. Not necessarily for a few reasons, strategists say.

First, a delay in the production ramp has been discussed at length on Wall Street and factored into a good chunk of profit estimates on Apple and the stock. Apple shares are down about 4% year-to-date, lagging the gains in other Big Cap tech stocks such as Microsoft (+10%), Amazon (+30%) and Netflix (+30%).

“This is right in line with our and many Street expectations with 5G slated to hit in late November/early December pre holidays,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

More important is that Apple is still — apparently — planning to have its new iPhones in the market before the critical holiday shopping season. By then, many would agree the U.S. economy will be in far better shape than it is today and interest in buying a new iPhone higher.

“This is something that was expected. The going thought is we push it forward or back a little bit [iPhone production]. That still gives people enough time to purchase devices for the important holiday season,” explained Futurum Research founder Daniel Newman on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

In the meantime, while major production delays would cripple the finances of most manufacturers, Apple is not a normal manufacturer. It’s a tech beast selling hardware that generates real-time money through various services and downloads. In turn, sell-side analysts estimate Apple will produce nearly $60 billion in free cash flow this year. That will easily allow Apple to fund a solid dividend and steady stream of profit-cushioning stock buybacks.

Apple ended its fiscal year (year ended Dec. 28) with more than $107 billion in cash and short-term investments.

“With a company with that much cash on their balance sheet, they are in a strong position to weather volatility,” notes Apple bull and chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments Victoria Fernandez.

And weather production delays, too.

Yahoo Finance’s Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the details. Howley also discusses Apple's potential plans to delay production on its newest iPhone.

Video Transcript

BRIAN SOZZI: Switching gears, Amazon is taking new steps to verify third party sellers. The e-commerce giant is testing the use of video calls to validate the seller's identity. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins us now to break it down. Dan, why wasn't Amazon doing this before?

DAN HOWLEY: I think they really just wanted kind of face-to-face interactions rather than a video interaction, but now that COVID has, obviously, everyone homebound, or at least preventing people from being able to meet in person, they're doing this video style. They had been piloting this before. They were using it in months prior, so this is something that they're continuing to use, and it's basically a way for them to vet sellers that are using the platform-- third-party sellers-- to ensure that what they're actually offering are legitimate products.

Now we've seen, obviously, investigations by various outlets showing-- I think particularly ""The Wall Street Journal""-- showed that they were offering some unsafe items, particularly children's toys with lead-based paint. There's obviously been an issue as well with the likes of Apple and Nike taking issue with the fact that there are fraudulent products sold through Amazon bearing their name. So now Nike doesn't even sell through Amazon as result. So this is a way for them to try to make sure that this is all kind of borne out, that they vet the people that are selling through their platform, and they can avoid any unfortunate issues with other companies disputing the fact that they may have fraudulent items or, more importantly, that items themselves are safe.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Hey, I want to switch gears for a minute here, Dan, and talk about Apple. I'm sure you saw this story in ""The Wall Street Journal"" this morning saying that the company is going to have to push back mass production of its flagship iPhone this year because of the pandemic. How much should investors be worried about that, given the fact that the iPhone makes up such a huge chunk of Apple's revenue?

Story continues

DAN HOWLEY: It's interesting, because, you know, we've seen reports saying that this was likely to happen for some time now. Most analysts I've spoken to-- particularly Dan Ives at Wedbush basically saying, look. It's more likely than not going to be delayed. We haven't heard anything, though, about the actual launch-- the launch event that they usually have in September. But if there's still lockdowns going on in September, that's not going to happen. And if there's still military hospitals set up in the country, that's probably not going to happen either. They would push it out a little longer.

I think for analysts and investors, this is something, as I said, was expected. The going thought now is, OK. So we push it forward a little bit or back a little bit. That's still gives people enough time to purchase these devices for the important holiday season. And as you go through the iPhone cell cycle, you'll have Q1-- you have the tail end of Q4, and Q2 where a lot of sales really happen. It's really just the end of Q4 there, though, when the new iPhones come out.

So the older phones start to phase out around Q3 and the bulk of Q4, and then we go back into the cycle. So it seems like they would still have the devices on store shelves for the tail-- the very tail end of Q4, Q1, Q2, and then into Q3.

HEIDI CHUNG: Hey, Dan, it's Heidi here. So a pretty busy week for you. We have a lot of those large cap tech names reporting. We just talked about Apple, but I want to get what The Wall Street analysts here are expecting when it comes to Microsoft, Amazon, a couple of those other names that you closely follow.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think for the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, Google, a lot of what we're going to be talking about is obviously cloud usage. We talked about how AWS had seen a surge. Azure from Microsoft likely saw a surge as well as Google's cloud platform. Any of these cloud companies are really taking a lot of traffic and as a result of so many people working from home and so many operations now having to be done remotely.

So I think we'll hear a lot about that. And don't forget, you know, these companies don't just provide services for businesses as far as B2B work. They also host platforms like Netflix, so they are going to see a ton of increased traffic, and that will probably bode very well for them. But then you have to think, OK, if the economy starts to slow down, Capex spending from companies will start to slow down, and that may translate into these companies saying, look. Down the line, we might not have the kinds of profits that we were expecting as a result of our cloud platforms simply because other companies aren't signing up for new contracts because they just don't have the bandwidth for it right now.

But I think for the coming quarters, we're going to see gangbusters stuff from them. Microsoft, on the other hand, with their hardware side, probably not. And Google as well. I think it's going to be harder for product side at this point.

579,2020-04-27T10:47:43+00:00,Coronavirus unleashes insane bubble in these 5 stocks and it could end badly for the bulls,"This market rally may be as fake as some of the bootleg hand sanitizers being hawked on Amazon and eBay at crazy prices to the worried quarantined masses.

Despite 26.45 million Americans having filed for unemployment claims the past five weeks and first quarter earnings season so far being as painful as being forced to watch “Tiger King” for the third time, the S&P 500 has rallied about 27% from the March 23 lows. The S&P 500’s forward price to earnings multiple of 21 times or so is at its highest level since right before the tech bubble back in December 2001.

Insane.

One would think we are amidst a solid economic expansion in the U.S. and accelerating EPS growth among businesses, not something as debilitating as the coronavirus pandemic.

“All the data is horrific. But it’s getting less bad than it was say a couple weeks ago and that’s especially true with jobless claims. So markets are focused on that marginal rate of change and and they think that the worst will be behind us when we move to May and June,” said Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Point well taken.

But the question right now the bulls should be asking themselves is how strong is the rally from the March lows, really? Are the bulls truly buying into the view the U.S. economy is back to its job creating, growth self this summer? Or, is the rally a mirage being fueled by heavy-hitting speculators (we see you, hedge funds) going back to tried and true winning trades in big cap tech? And in turn, this is creating the momentum that lures in the suckers just before the bottom drops out of the entire market again.

The data supports the latter observation.

The five big cap tech stocks

Coming into 2020, the five largest S&P 500 stocks comprised 18% of its market cap, matching the share at the peak of the tech bubble in March 2000, Goldman Sachs strategists note. Since then, those stocks — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook — have risen to account for 20% of the S&P 500’s market cap.

Story continues The statue of the charging bull is pictured on April 20, 2020 in New York City. - Wall Street opened lower on Monday as traders grappled with a drop in oil prices to 22-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand for energy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 percent to 23,798.01 about 10 minutes into the trading session.The broad-based S&P 500 had declined 1.3 percent to 2,835.08, while the tech-rich Nasdaq had fallen 0.7 percent to 8,588.66. (Photo by Johannes EISELE / AFP) (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)

Looked at another way, all five of those big cap tech stocks have handily outperformed the S&P 500’s 14% drop, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data — led by a 30% pop in Amazon. In effect, investors have pretty much forgotten about the other 495 stocks in the benchmark index because they have less belief in their ability to navigate the coronavirus situation for whatever reason.

A healthy market rally, however, would be under-pinned by a belief that more than five companies will successfully come out the other side. Where are the bets in industrial names? How about taking a stab at battered oil stocks — if the economy is going to burst back into gear later this year, surely we will need greater oil than the present right?

“Many market participants – ourselves included – have expressed incredulity at the fact that the S&P 500 trades just 17% below its all-time high amid the largest economic shock in nearly a century. Below the surface of the market, however, the median S&P 500 constituent trades 28% below its record high. This 11 percentage point gap is one measure of market breadth, which now stands roughly a standard deviation below its historical average,” the Goldman Sachs equities strategy team writes.

Such narrow breadth in the market comes with a warning from Goldman, as it should.

Says Goldman, “In addition to the Tech Bubble, breadth narrowed ahead of the recessions in 1990 and 2008 and the economic slowdowns of 2011 and 2016. Historically, sharply narrowing breadth has signaled below-average 1-, 3-, and 6- month S&P 500 returns as well as larger-than-average prospective drawdowns.”

And who is to say Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are worthy of their even more premium current valuations? None of these companies have reported first quarter earnings yet.

You mean to tell me 26.45 million jobless Americans doesn’t equate to reduced spending on cloud computing upgrades this year (it does)? A severe economic downturn in the U.S. like we are experiencing doesn’t mean sharply lower consumer spending (it has already, per retail sales data) and downside financial risk for Amazon? Small businesses going under will pressure advertising on Facebook.

The market will do what it wants to do in the end. What’s right though is a pause in the upward momentum in stocks, especially five enormous tech stocks.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: So for more on today's market, I want to bring in Keith Fitzgerald, chief investment strategist at Money Map Pricing. Keith, help me make sense of what's going on in the markets. What do you think investors are focusing on at this point?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, this is actually a good type of market action right now. It's a little bit muted for what I'd like to see at this stage of the recovery, but the narrative has shifted from doom and gloom to positive to what's going to happen when we come out of this. Psychologically, that's very important. Financially, that's very important. Because the support you're seeing key among sectors, you know, tech, medicine, some of those types of things.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, what do you-- what are investors, or how are they making sense of what we saw in the oil market, the turmoil recently in oil? How do you think investors are digesting that, and how is that affecting their outlook here, at least for the short term?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, I tell you, there's sort of two answers to that. The first is, is the world of high finance. It's not readily apparent to the average investor because what happened was largely a technical screw-up in the futures markets. As that affects our markets, oil, what that really says is there's simply too much of it going around. So if you went to the service station to take a drive, and service station would be paying you to fill your car up.

But again, even that's not so bad because when the recovery hits, there's plenty of gas available. That means consumers are going to benefit. As we go and we start running around and spending money, that's going to be a good narrative.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, it's interesting. When we focus on today's market move in the S&P, the range today was less than 1%. It's the lowest that we have seen since the all-time high that we hit back in February. What do you think-- are you reading into this at all, and do you expect us to be range bound here, maybe at least for the short term?

Story continues

KEITH FITZGERALD: Actually, no, I think the computers are building up energy to figure out what's going to happen next. Investors are trying to figure out whether we're going to revisit the lows or run to new highs. The answer to that is not yet seen, but what we do see, this is technically called compression. And when we get this type of phenomenon, we know the market is building up energy to move.

Now the president has made it very clear which way he wants to see things go. The Fed has made it very clear which way they want to see things go. Now it's all up to the traders and the sentiment. I think it's going to push higher, but we're going to have a little bit of turmoil coming into next week.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, what do you think investors are focusing on, just in terms of why there's still so much optimism in the market? Because I know you're saying that you expect markets to continue to push higher, but when you drill down into some of that economic data that we got out this week, it just simply does not look good.

We had that consumer sentiment number out this morning falling in April, that jobless claims number out yesterday, 4.4 million more people filing for unemployment. How are investors able to kind of wrap their heads around this and put it on the backburner and move on?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, funny enough, this is one of the few areas where individual investors have the advantage, watching professionals have to continually cycle money through the markets, which means they have to keep it moving. Individual investors can concentrate on CEOs, on the best companies with a clear path to profit, those that have huge piles of cash, and they can pick and choose very carefully.

So I actually, the folks I'm talking to around the world are very, very calm, believe it or not. Because they understand the CEOs have to play this game, regardless of what happens in the markets themselves. That, to me, is a source of profits and optimism.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, when you're taking a look at the market right now, what looks attractive to you? What are you buying?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, there's certain tech companies, for example, Micron and Nvidia that are critical. The coronavirus actually improves their bottom line a quarter or two from now. I'm very keen on other companies. You know, Apple, for example, earnings is coming out on Microsoft. Those are a lot of the companies I'm watching very, very closely because they have the potential to ride right through this and strong enough balance sheets to do it.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, you just mentioned earnings there. What are your thoughts on what we've seen so far? Because this week, we had just around a fifth of the companies in S&P 500 early reporting earnings. From what we've gotten this week, what do you think that tells us about what lies ahead for earnings season?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, I'm less concerned about the earnings themselves because it's kind of like betting on a horse race after you know the results. You know, Wall Street is going to have to do its homework. I think yanking guidance, as some of the companies have done.

But the big thing, to me, the critical takeaway is that we've seen a number of companies report solid numbers. So that says to me that not everything is broken, that we will get through this, and again, being an optimist at heart and in my capacity as chief investment strategist, I don't have the luxury of being right or wrong. What I have to do is look for the profitability, and again, that is a good takeaway for me.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, I was reading through your notes, and the one thing that stuck out to me was what you said about the retail sector and how you've remained very concerned by the tsunami of retail failures ahead. What do you mean by that, and what do you think the broader implications of this could be?

KEITH FITZGERALD: You know, this is really, if there's a negative here, it's millions of investors have been hurt. Millions of people are out of work. The retail sector, you've got Neiman Marcus, Gap. You've got other retailers who maybe are not going to be able to pay their rent, certainly not going to be able to pay their employees. I think we're going to have a huge number of stores that are going to go out of business, never to return again.

That has implications for shopping space, for malls, for office rentals. There's a lot of blowback that we haven't yet accounted for I think remain ahead. So that, to me, is the real negative here.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, real quick, on monetary and fiscal policies that have been put in place over the last couple of months trying to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, do you think they go far enough? And do you think that we'll need some more aggressive action from either the Fed or from Congress?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, I'll tell you what. I wish I was smart enough to figure that out. It strikes me as, you know, if we come out of this, if we really get a path to recovery, we start opening the country. And you know what? It's probably OK.

But if we have to extend the lockdown for any reason, if we have to stay in our homes, we have to shelter in place, and we get a secondary infection blown, then I don't think it is enough. I think we're going to have to have more extreme action, as unthinkable as that is.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Keith Fitzgerald of Money Map Press, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.

If you find yourself in the enviable position of being able to ponder how to invest your stimulus check, thank your lucky stars ... for plenty of reasons.

As you're well aware by now, the $2 trillion CARES Act rescue package included stimulus checks of up to $1,200 for most individuals living in the U.S. The sad reality is, many Americans will need every cent of that for day-to-day basics. But more than a few people are fortunate enough to be able to put that money to work. Anecdotally, a few friends have already asked me about how to invest their recently deposited stimulus checks. And more people are sure to wonder the same as the Treasury proceeds with its disbursements.

The good news? Despite how ugly the market looks right now - in many cases, because the market looks so ugly right now - you've got options. And plenty of 'em.

Today, we're going to look at how to invest your stimulus check. Because everyone's risk tolerance is a little different, we'll be exploring a variety of options - conservative, aggressive and a little in between.

Especially if you're a novice investor, one of the best things you can do with your stimulus check is to plunk it down into a boring index fund.

Back in 2008, near the depths of the last bear market, Knight Kiplinger wrote to readers, ""Why I'm Buying Stocks."" What did he buy on discount? Everything. ""I invested in virtually the entire universe of U.S. publicly traded companies, through a ""total market"" index fund,"" he wrote. ""This gives me a sliver of some 2,500 companies, large and small, in every corner of American business - everyday consumer products, heavy manufacturing, technology, energy, health care, food and agriculture, and yes, even housing and financial services, the most-shunned stocks of all. I'm not sure which of these sectors will fare better than the others, so I hedged my bets by buying all of them.""

I know. It's a boring, unsatisfying suggestion. Scroll down if you want to get to the exciting stuff.

But if you're looking to put money to work right away, and you're inexperienced with researching stocks, plain ol' index funds can give you access to a wide range of stocks - typically for minimal fees. Stocks, at least for now, are well off their nadir, but you'd still be buying on a considerable dip right now. The S&P 500, for instance, is down about 15% year-to-date and roughly 19% off its all-time highs.

A straightforward suggestion is an S&P 500 tracking fund such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) or SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG), both of which charge just 0.03%, or $3 for every $10,000 invested, each year to own.

But there are other ways to ""buy the market."" The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), for instance, holds 3,535 stocks, spread across large-, mid- and even small-cap companies. The fund is cap-weighted, meaning that each stock's weight is determined by its market cap, meaning that most of its weight is in the same stocks VOO and SPLG hold. But you get a little more exposure to the ""growthier"" small companies that trade on U.S. exchanges.

If you're worried that the S&P 500 is too top-heavy - Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) make up nearly 20% of the index's weight - you can try the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). This fund invests in each S&P 500 stock at the same weight every quarter when the fund rebalances. Do you want more of these tech giants? Consider the Invesco QQQ Portfolio (QQQ), which invests in the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the Nasdaq; those aforementioned technology companies make up nearly 45% of the portfolio!

Dividend Aristocrats and Other ""Bulletproof"" Blue Chips

Wall Street analysts and other market experts generally agree the economy, earnings and the stock market are in for short-term pain. Where they diverge is how soon everything will pick back up again.

That unknown makes all the difference in the world. It's one thing to survive a quarter or two with considerably diminished profits. It's another to, say, survive amid rolling quarantines through mid-2021 or persistently low unemployment even after restrictions are lifted because many Americans continue to shut themselves in until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.

If you want to invest your stimulus check while hedging against a bad-case scenario, your best equity bets are big, blue-chip stocks with bulletproof balance sheets. Companies that are low on debt and high on cash and investments, and that can generate cash even as business slows, are more likely to survive. More importantly, they offer numerous other advantages:

They're in a position to gain market share on lesser-capitalized competitors. They're in a position to continue marketing, researching and developing products and services, setting themselves up for growth on the other end of a recession. They're in a position to make transformative M&A moves as acquisition targets get cheaper.

Income investors have another reason to target these kinds of companies: They're more likely to continue delivering regular cash dividends. Dozens of firms have been forced to cut or suspend their dividends, leaving retirees - many of whom rely on those payouts to tackle their regular expenses - in the lurch.

If income is a priority, consider browsing the ranks of the Dividend Aristocrats: S&P 500 companies that have increased their dividends without interruption for at least 25 years. That means their payouts have already survived two bear markets (2007-09 and 2000-02), and in many cases, several more.

Most of these companies have the means to keep their payouts intact. And even the members that are struggling the most are moving heaven and earth to remain in the club. Take Chevron (CVX), for example. In the face of perilously low oil prices, CEO Michael Wirth called the dividend Chevron's ""No. 1 priority"" - and CVX is cutting buybacks and even capital expenditures just to keep its payout intact.

Chevron (or any other energy stock, for that matter) might be too speculative for some tastes. That's OK: The Aristocrats include many other stocks with more stable outlooks.

Work-From-Home Stocks

Call them ""work-from-home"" stocks, ""stay-at-home"" stocks or ""social distancing"" stocks ...

... but don't call them a fad.

Web conferencing. Collaboration software. Home health. Streaming media. Yes, some of these stocks have become overheated in the short-term - think Zoom Communications (ZM, +150% year-to-date) and Teladoc Health (TDOC, +123%) - as investors look for anything that's growing while the economy is shrinking. But while they might cool down in the wake of an eventual ""reopening"" of the economy, the future is in their favor.

This forced work-from-home experiment has demonstrated that some organizations can indeed function, and function well, with most if not all of their employees working full-time from home. While many Americans are likely to trickle back into the office as restrictions are gradually lifted, expect the growth of regular remote working to accelerate now that more employees have enjoyed some of the benefits (such as the time and money saved by not commuting) - and as employers realize the potential cost savings of smaller office spaces.

This trend should be a boon not just for firms that facilitate this kind of work, but other companies that offer digital convenience, including e-commerce and telehealth firms.

You could invest some of your stimulus check in some of these individual names. But if you want to avoid single-stock risk, just wait. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Direxion has filed for a fund focused on stocks that would benefit from more virtual work, with the appropriate ticker symbol ""WFH.""

Moonshots

If $1,200 suddenly pops into your lap, why not use it to take a flyer on a high-risk, high-reward play? If it doesn't pan out, all you've lost is a windfall that you weren't expecting in the first place.

That doesn't mean you should go out and plunk your stimulus check on a blind gamble, of course. But there's nothing wrong with trying to generate a little alpha with an aggressive growth play - indeed, many financial professionals will tell you there's nothing wrong with allocating a little of your portfolio to the occasional moonshot.

Or, rather than growth, you could consider deep, deep value investing. Stocks in a number of industries - think casinos, cruise lines, airlines and oil production - have been driven into the ground. But a few companies that are effectively priced for disaster could very well bounce back thanks not just to an eventual economic recovery, but consolidation within their industries as the weaker players fail.

Consider the airline industry. While carriers have watched business all but dry up - Delta Air Lines (DAL), for instance, recently reported that it's burning $100 million in cash each day and estimate second-quarter revenues will decline 90% year-over-year - it's unlikely the industry will be allowed to collapse completely. It might not look the same, some carriers might be smaller and others might disappear, but the survivors could prove to be lucrative picks, much like they were following drastic declines in 2008-09.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) might be the pick of the litter. Oh, it's ugly. LUV, which has already tapped $2.3 billion from a credit line, is applying for up to $12 billion in government aid. And it's at risk of being forced to implement its first involuntary furloughs in company history.

But Southwest also has one of the best reputations among airline passengers and consumers alike, it has a value tilt, and it entered this crisis with one of the sturdiest balance sheets in the industry thanks to able management. Those are advantages you want out of any airline trying to claw its way out of this mess.

The coronavirus outbreak is exacting a terrible economic toll on individual Americans and community businesses alike. While Washington has delivered trillions of dollars in aid - including these stimulus checks - much, much more help is needed.

If you want to help small businesses while also earning a small return, you can make traditional investments via microloans. Companies such as LendingClub (LC), Prosper and Kiva allow you to make small-dollar investments in other businesses via their platforms. LendingClub, for instance, has individual accounts that require a mere $1,000 minimum investment; with that, you can invest by lending to one company, or spread out your money across multiple firms in increments as small as $25.

What kind of returns can you expect? LendingClub provides an example that shows an average 14% interest rate for a portfolio, then backs out 8% in principal and interest losses and 1% in fees for an annualized 5% net return. Just keep your eyes open: This isn't a normal investing environment, so your results could vary considerably.

If you're less concerned about making a financial gain, you can simply inject local businesses with a little cash. Patronize local businesses through their e-commerce sites. If you use Uber Eats for takeout from your favorite local restaurant, consider their in-app button allowing you to donate extra money directly to the restaurant - and Uber will match donations (up to $3 million total) with a contribution to the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. In some cases, businesses are setting up GoFundMe, Indiegogo or other crowdfunding sites to drum up much-needed funds.

At the simplest level, you can help your fellow Americans by donating to a local or state food bank, or other charities that can help out the nation's most vulnerable at this time. If you do plan on giving, consult a charity-rating site such as Charity Navigator to ensure you're donating to an organization that will make good use of your contributions.

Kyle Woodley was long AMZN, FB, LUV, MSFT, QQQ and VOO as of this writing. He is pledging a portion of his stimulus check (whenever it arrives) to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank.

Those are the second- and fourth-largest states, respectively.

The S&P 500 fell 0.05%

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%

The Nasdaq Composite inched lower by 0.01% For the first time in awhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow’s top performer, adding 3% today.

Thursday is jobless claims today and suffice to say, the latest numbers aren’t good, but they were less bad. Last week, 4.43 million Americans applied for jobless benefits, bringing the five-week tally to a staggering 26.5 million. The prior week’s figure was also revised lower to 5.24 million. However, the problem areas include some of the largest states.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

“California reported the most initial claims last week, at an unadjusted 533,600, down from 655,500 the prior week. Florida was next, followed by Texas at 280,400, up slightly from the prior week,” reports Bloomberg.

Peak unemployment claims were probably notched a couple of weeks, but the outlook is still dismal as some economists believe the U.S. rate of joblessness is heading for 20%.

To some extent, stocks fought off that ominous prediction as 18 of 30 Dow members were higher in late trading.

Apple News

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn’t do much today despite reports that the company is aiming to sell Macs powered by in-house semiconductors next year. Reports indicate Apple will unveil at least one Mac next year with its own chips and this could be a growing theme across Apple’s product line because the company is searching for new processors as an avenue for setting itself apart from rivals.

Microsoft Rumors

Apple wasn’t the only Dow Jones tech name subject to the rumor mill today. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed slightly lower — more a testament to today’s sluggish action than anything else — amid rumors that the company is planning a big-time game reveal sometime soon. For now, it’s a rumor, but it makes sense because video game hardware makers, including Microsoft, are expected to launch new consoles later this year.

Not Reacting to Bad News

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the poster children for coronavirus equity erosion, but the stock traded modestly higher despite another day of challenging headlines. This time around, it was Standard & Poor’s downgrading Disney’s credit rating to “A-” from “A” while keeping a “negative” outlook on the rating.

“Disney’s theme parks won’t likely return to normal capacity utilization at the same rate as the overall economy even after stay-at-home restrictions are eased and the theme parks are allowed to reopen,” said the ratings agency.

Another Wild Day for Oil

Oil notched another epic rally, this time it was 20% intraday gain, helping Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) into the Dow winners circle. Speculating as to long oil upside will last is tricky, but it pays to remember this is coming against the backdrop of weak demand and poor economic data.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today

Making near-term equity market upside something of a dubious proposition is that, as FactSet points out, global economic data is slack, meaning Covid-19 is hampering more than just the U.S. and Chinese economies.

“Analysts surveyed by FactSet are now forecasting a 2.9% contraction in U.S. GDP in 2020; this compares to the 1.8% expansion predicted at the end of February,” according to the research firm. “The Eurozone economy is expected to shrink by 4.8% in 2020 while the UK is projected to see its economy contract by 4.9%. China’s GDP is expected to grow by just 2.2%, the country’s slowest GDP growth since official records began.”

Although right now, equities strategists would universally agree the market has factored in two quarters of outright economic ugliness in the United States at the hands of the deadly coronavirus.

The wild cards sitting here today is how the market will react to finally receiving the economic dread it has come to expect since the health pandemic erupted in early March. And then, has the market bounced too hard from the March lows on the expectation of V-shaped economic recovery later this year that may not appear, given the realities of a post pandemic world?

“I think the expectation of market participants is that we’re in the Great Depression and that in a sense, the news can’t get much worse,” said BNY Mellon chief strategist Alicia Levine on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

To Levine’s point, it’s interesting to see the market continue to rally in the face of brutal reads on the U.S. economy. It only fuels the thesis that the bottom in the markets formed on March 23, which may be a flawed view. The latest upbeat market response arrived on Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 300 points in the face of news that another 4.427 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits.

Since mid-March, 26 million more people have applied for jobless benefits. This would mean an unemployment rate of 20.6%, per math from MUFG chief economist Chis Rupkey, who points out the rate is closing in on Great Depression levels where a quarter of all jobs are lost.

“It is going to take years not months to put these pandemic jobless workers back to work at the shops and malls and factories and restaurants across the country. What are stock market investors thinking? There's at least 33 million people out of work in the country. Investors should be running for their lives,” Rupkey contends.

Rupkey notes the stock market fell 57.7% at the worst point of the Great Depression. The S&P 500 was only down 13.3% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close of trading.

‘I would be hedging myself’

Moreover, big cap tech stocks such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Netflix continue to trade as if this was the 2019 economy, not one where a quarter of jobs in America have vanished within two months. The Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 ratio has climbed back to 2000 dot com bubble highs, points out researchers at SunDial Capital.

At some point soon, the market could be forced into pulling off its rose-colored glasses. Sure, extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve is a major backstop to equities as history has proven again and again. But for investors to completely ignore jarring information on the economy seems absurd.

“I would be hedging myself in this marketplace. There is still a lot of uncertainty, there is an outstanding number of people that are not working right now,” says Advisorshares CEO Noah Hamman. “I’m optimistic that the economy is going to turn around. But it doesn’t mean that the stock market is going to follow along with it.”

Sounds like reasonable insight inside of a Great Depression.

584,2020-04-23T00:37:13+00:00,INSIGHT-American quandary: How to secure weapons-grade minerals without China,"(Updates with MP Materials award from Pentagon)

By Ernest Scheyder

MOUNTAIN PASS, Calif., April 22 (Reuters) - The United States wants to curb its reliance on China for specialized minerals used to make weapons and high-tech equipment, but it faces a Catch-22.

It only has one rare earths mine - and government scientists have been told not to work with it because of its Chinese ties.

The mine is southern California's Mountain Pass, home to the world's eighth-largest reserves of the rare earths used in missiles, fighter jets, night-vision goggles and other devices.

But the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has told government scientists not to collaborate with the mine's owner, MP Materials, the DOE's Critical Materials Institute told Reuters.

This is because MP Materials is almost a tenth-owned by a Chinese investor and relies heavily on Chinese sales and technical know-how, according to the company.

""Clearly, the MP Materials ownership structure is an issue,"" said Tom Lograsso, interim director of the institute, the focal point of the U.S. government's rare earths research and a facility that typically works closely with private industry.

""We're going to allow the people in Washington to figure this out.""

The DOE instruction, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the competing pressures facing officials looking to resurrect the U.S. commercial rare earths industry, which has all but disappeared since its genesis in World War Two's Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Lograsso did not say how the guidance was delivered to the institute.

Reviving domestic rare earths production has become a priority in Washington as relations with China, which dominates global supplies, have become increasingly frayed and U.S. lawmakers warn of the dangers of relying on a competitor for critical defense components.

Even as the DOE has blacklisted MP Materials, the company is a candidate to receive up to $40 million in funding from the Pentagon to produce light rare earths, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Light rare earths are the most-commonly used of the specialized materials.

Story continues

The Pentagon has yet to announce its decision on that funding, which could go to more than one project, after delaying the decision from March due to the coronavirus crisis.

Late Wednesday, MP Materials said it had been awarded Pentagon funding for a facility to process heavy rare earths, a less-common type of the specialized minerals. The amount was not disclosed, but the funds will be used for planning and design work. MP will have to solicit the Pentagon again for construction-related funds.

MP Materials is by far the most advanced player in the U.S. rare earths industry, given no rival project has even broken ground. As such, Mountain Pass is widely seen by industry analysts as a front-runner for Pentagon funding.

The DOE did not respond to requests for comment on the instruction to scientists or any potential conflict with Pentagon policy.

The Pentagon is working closely with ""the president, Congress, allies, partners and the industrial base to mitigate U.S. reliance on China for rare earth minerals,"" said spokesman Lt Col Mike Andrews. The department did not respond to requests for comment on whether it might fund Mountain Pass or potential conflicts with DOE policy.

APPLE TO LOCKHEED

MP Materials, which bought the mine in 2017, describes itself as an American-controlled company with a predominantly U.S. workforce. The privately held firm is 9.9%-owned by China's Shenghe Resources Holding Co, though, and Chinese customers account for all its annual revenue of about $100 million.

""Had we not had a Chinese technical partner helping us do this relaunch, there's no way this could have been done,"" said James Litinsky, chief executive of JHL Capital Group LLC, a Chicago-based hedge fund and MP Materials' majority owner.

Litinsky declined to comment on the Pentagon funding.

Asked for comment on the DOE instruction to scientists, Litinsky said: ""MP is on a mission to restore the full rare earth supply chain to the United States of America, whether the government helps us or not.""

Shenghe did not respond to requests for comment.

MP Materials is among a slew of U.S. companies dependent on China's rare earths industry. Apple Inc uses Chinese rare earths in its iPhone's taptic engine, which makes the phone vibrate. Lockheed Martin Corp uses them to make the F-35 Lightning fighter jet. General Dynamics Corp uses them to build the Virginia-class submarine.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further driven home the global nature of supply chains and just how heavily Western countries rely on manufacturing powerhouse China for a host of key products, including drug ingredients.

MANHATTAN PROJECT

Mountain Pass first opened in the late 1940s to extract europium, a rare earth used to produce the color red in televisions. It drew heavily on technology developed by Manhattan Project government scientists to separate the 17 rare earths, a complex and expensive process.

By the early 1980s, the mine was a top global rare earths producer. Its minerals were in much of the equipment that U.S. soldiers used during the first Gulf War in 1990.

However, China ramped up development of a massive rare earths refining network and began boosting exports, undercutting other producers. ""The Middle East has oil. China has rare earths,"" then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said in 1992.

In 2010, China halted supplies to Japan during a diplomatic dispute, unnerving U.S. military officials who wondered if China could one day do the same to the United States.

That refocused Washington's attention on the mine and its then-owner Molycorp, which launched a $400 million initial public offering the same year.

Even as U.S. government scientists began research projects with Molycorp, though, the company went bankrupt in 2015 under the weight of its debt - partly built up to comply with tightened environmental regulations from the Obama administration - and cheaper Chinese competition.

Two years later, Litinsky's group and Shenghe bought Mountain Pass out of bankruptcy. The processing equipment installed by Molycorp, however, remains unused because of poor design, Litinsky said.

For now, MP Materials ships more than 50,000 tonnes of concentrated rare earths per year to China for processing, the Achilles heel of the U.S. industry.

The company aims to restart its own processing by the end of 2020, Litinsky said. The goal is to produce about 5,000 tonnes per year of the two most common rare earth metals, more than enough for U.S. military needs.

Some rare earths analysts and academics have doubted whether Mountain Pass can resume processing so soon, citing concerns about its plans for waste disposal and water filtration.

'NATIONAL SECURITY MALPRACTICE'

Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters that the United States' reliance on China for defense components could pose a strategic military threat.

""It would be national security malpractice not to address this,"" said Rubio, who sits on the Senate's Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees.

This was echoed by Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who said the issue of creating a viable domestic industry had been ignored for too many years.

""This isn't an issue we can just kick down the road,"" said Houlahan, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee.

The Pentagon asked miners in early 2019 to outline plans to develop rare earths projects and processing facilities, according to documents seen by Reuters.

President Donald Trump sharpened the directive last July, telling the Pentagon to fund U.S. rare earths projects and find better ways to procure military-grade magnets made from rare earths.

Earlier on Wednesday, Australia-based Lynas Corp and privately held Blue Line Corp also said they were chosen by the Pentagon to process heavy rare earths imported from Australia in a plant to be built in Texas. The deadline to apply for that for that project was in December.

Other applicants for the Pentagon funding programs included Texas Mineral Resources Corp; a joint venture between Alaska's UCore Rare Metals and Materion Corp; Medallion Resources Ltd and Search Minerals Inc, both of Canada; and Nebraska's NioCorp Developments Ltd.

Meanwhile, U.S. government scientists at the DOE institute are studying ways to recycle rare earth magnets, to find substitutes and to locate new sources of the strategic minerals. None of that research is shared with MP Materials.

""MP Materials recognizes they have become the elephant in the room that the U.S. government doesn't want to acknowledge, given their relationship with Shenghe,"" said Ryan Castilloux, a rare earths industry consultant at Adamas Intelligence.

7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential

When that happens, you want to be well positioned to make money from that, too. Here are the top three ways to do just that.

ShortVIXShort-Term FuturesETF (NYSE:SVXY) VelocityShares Inverse VIX Mid-Term ETF (NASDAQ:ZIV) InvescoQQQ ETrust (NASDAQ:QQQ)

These three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are the ones to watch. But a word of warning — some of these funds intend to match the daily results of the index, and holding them long-term can introduce its own volatility.

Profit From Volatility: ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) The Top 3 Ways to Trade a Pullback in Volatility

Expense Ratio: 0.95%, or $95 per $10,000 invested annually

My first pick is the SVXY. This ETF was designed to offer one half the inverse of the S&P 500VIX Short-Term Futures Index, daily. Along with the VIX, it was designed to track the changes in expectations for one month in the future.

At the moment, the ETF trades around $32 after diving from a high of $67.50. With a good chunk of fear firmly priced into the market, the SVXY ETF could refill a bearish gap around $66, near-term. Of course, plenty of patience is required at the moment.

We must also remember that crisis often leads to big opportunity. As even billionaire Warren Buffett will tell you, be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. Baron Rothschild also teaches us to “buy the blood in the streets.”

Expense Ratio: 1.35%

My second volatility pick is the ZIV. This ETN was designed to offer inverse exposure to an index of VIX futures. It seeks -1x the returns of the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures for a single day. As volatility decreases, the ZIV ETN will typically push higher.

At the moment, the ETN trades around $32 after tumbling from a Feb. 2020 high of $76.47. With a good amount of patience, I strongly believe the ZIV ETN could refill its bearish gap around $75 a share.

As even Sir John Templeton would tell investors, “The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.”

Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ)

Another way to trade deflating volatility is by buying the QQQ, which I mentioned on March 25, 2020 as it traded at $185 a share. At the moment, it’s up to $202 and could refill a bearish gap around $230 a share with patience.

The beauty of the QQQ ETF is that it offers more for less. And most of its top holdings are wildly oversold on coronavirus fears. For less than $200 a share, you’re offered exposure to tech companies, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and dozens more at a steep discount.

With a good amount of fear priced in, I strongly believe the QQQ is overdue for a big rally.

586,2020-04-08T08:18:23+00:00,Apple Partner Foxconn to Start Making Ventilators in U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn, the company responsible for assembling most of the world’s Apple Inc. iPhones, will aid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic by developing and making ventilators in the U.S.

The Wisconsin plant owned by Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., will be used to manufacture ventilators, Medtronic Plc Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak told CNBC.

Foxconn confirmed the partnership in a statement on Wednesday but did not say when it will start making the medical equipment. Evelyn Tsai, spokesperson for founder Terry Gou, said production would take place in Wisconsin and Taiwan.

There has been a critical shortage of supply globally for ventilators needed in the treatment of severe cases of Covid-19. Foxconn’s collaboration with Medtronic covers design and development of the devices. Production will start within the next four to six weeks, Ishrak said, without quantifying a volume.

Foxconn has been making face masks, used to curb the spread of the virus, in China since February and its subsidiary Sharp Corp. also began churning them out in Japan in late March.

The company’s share price was up 5.3% in Taipei on Wednesday. It released better-than-anticipated March-quarter sales numbers on April 6.

Fellow Taiwanese tech manufacturing supplier Kinpo Electronics Inc. also announced plans to begin producing coronavirus-fighting medical equipment in the U.S. starting in May.

Foxconn’s contract for its Wisconsin plant was signed with great fanfare in late 2017. President Donald Trump, who had helped bring the deal together with the state’s then-governor, Republican Scott Walker, said Foxconn would revitalize U.S. manufacturing and that its massive factory hub would become “the Eighth Wonder of the World.”

Since then, the plant-- which was originally intended for making display panels -- has been criticized for delays and changes of direction. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with 178 full-time employees.

587,2020-04-07T03:53:56+00:00,Samsung Will Offer Clues on How Covid-19 Is Roiling Global Tech,"(Bloomberg) --

When Samsung Electronics Co. brass addressed analysts during its last earnings call, much of the talk revolved around finally turning the corner after years in the doldrums. That was in January, before Covid-19 threw the global economy into a tailspin.

Now, executives are struggling to assess the damage. In the short term, Samsung’s most profitable business is riding a surge in online activity from the millions confined to home, driving demand for the memory chips that help power datacenters and cloud services. But should the pandemic persist into the second half -- a worst-case scenario -- the tech giant foresees missing its own 2020 revenue projections by a double-digit percentage, according to people familiar with internal discussions.

Samsung unveils preliminary earnings Tuesday, becoming one of the first major technology corporations to paint a picture of how the pandemic impacted the global tech industry in 2020’s first three months. As the world’s largest maker of memory chips, phones, displays and appliances, the Korean giant is exposed to the economic shocks of Covid-19 like few other tech corporations. The novel coronavirus has already forced Korea’s largest company to shut plants from Gumi at home to India, costing Samsung days of lost production. While it’s expected to post first-quarter revenue growth, the question is whether the initial surge in semiconductor demand can offset a hit from what could be the worst global economic shock in at least a generation.

“We are truly in uncharted waters as the tech industry in general has continued to grow, perhaps at varying rates, but we haven’t seen a broad-based, global downturn such as we may be in line for,” said Robert Maire, president of Semiconductor Advisors in New York. Chip demand in particular “will likely not be as robust as it could have been as demand for devices that contain semiconductors, such as smartphones, TVs and consumer electronics, will be reduced through negative economic impact.”

Story continues

Foremost among the divisions under scrutiny is the semiconductor unit, which accounts for more than half of operating profits at Samsung. It’s been pounding out memory chips -- the lubricant of the tech industry -- round the clock, essential in datacenters hosting everything from video conferences to e-commerce. But executives and investors worry that prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns may crimp final demand for smartphones and other electronics -- and ultimately deal a serious blow to the chip industry’s nascent recovery.

Samsung’s shares have dived more than 20% since their January 2020 peak, depressed by a series of analysts’ price-target cuts. Much of the hit could come this quarter since Covid-19 escalated globally in March. Revenue growth is likely to fall off steeply, according to Eugene Investment & Securities, which projects a 12.3% decline in the June quarter from a forecast for a mere 0.1% increase in the January to March period.

Among the analysts that cut price targets was Hana Financial Investment, which also slashed its projection for Samsung’s 2020 smartphone sales from 300 million units to 260 million. It expects OLED panel shipments to plunge 12% to 373 million this year. Now that the Euro 2020 soccer tournament and Tokyo Olympics have been postponed, TrendForce also lowered its market forecast for TV shipments by 5.8% to 205.2 million units, warning that could slip further as the situation worsens in North America and Asia.

“The current financial crisis that accompanies the pandemic has produced a lot of uncertainties and could surpass the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 in scale,” TrendForce said on March 30. “Hence, the general economic outlook for 2H20 could become even gloomier as the pandemic is not expected to be brought under control in the short term.”

Read more: Micron Gives Strong Outlook Lifted By Data-Center Demand

That’s a far cry from just a month ago, when Samsung told shareholders the memory market will stabilize this year thanks to upgrades in manufacturing processes, datacenter expansions and the rollout of fifth-generation or 5G wireless networks. Having learned its lesson from previous industry slumps, Samsung was confident it could maintain a balance between supply and demand for memory chips, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about internal deliberations. Their prime concern was avoiding a repeat of the oversupply that triggered a chip price crash in 2019, they said.

The industry is still toting up the impact of the pandemic. In a positive scenario, analysts expect pent-up demand for smartphones and sustained use of online learning and work-from-home gear like laptops to engender a soft-landing for Samsung later this year. Just a week ago, Qualcomm Inc. and Western Digital Corp. said they were seeing a recovery in demand from Chinese consumers for phones and computer disk drives. And Micron Technology Inc. has predicted stronger-than-expected revenue.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Memory chips are likely in tight supply due to disruptions in obtaining certain raw materials and equipment on the Covid-19 outbreak. This may bolster DRAM and NAND sentiment following rising contract prices in March, supported by rising remote work access needs, despite an extended smartphone shipment slump to 2Q.

It may well be that the disease will encourage shifts in consumer activity that benefit the industry in the long run, said C.J. Muse, senior managing director at Everscore ISI in New York.

“The world is changing,” said Muse. “There is clearly something that, over the long term in this kind of virus world, should be positive, given how our lives are evolving and how important the cloud is to a lot of what we do now and even more than ever.”

588,2020-04-07T02:53:24+00:00,Samsung’s Profit Beat Showcases a Rare Bright Spot in a Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s better-than-expected profit revives hopes that a surge in internet usage from people sheltering in place during the Covid-19 pandemic will help make up for a drop-off in demand for smartphones and other consumer electronics.

Shares in Korea’s largest company climbed more than 3% after it posted operating profit of 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) in the March quarter, surpassing the average analyst estimate by 3.6%. Sales rose 5% to 55 trillion won, according to preliminary results released Tuesday. The company didn’t provide net income or break out divisional performance, which it will do later this month when it releases final numbers.

Samsung -- one of the first major technology corporations to unveil March quarter results -- demonstrates how the novel coronavirus outbreak is exerting an uneven impact on the global electronics sector in the short term. Soaring online activity from gaming to video streaming is driving sales of semiconductors -- the lubricant for the internet and Samsung’s most profitable business -- even as worsening employment prospects curtail spending on gadgets such as the company’s just-released flagship Galaxy S20.

The Asian giant’s solid performance underscores expectations for resilient chip demand since Micron Technology Inc.’s stronger than anticipated outlook. That lifted Asian chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Nanya Technology Corp. Much now hinges on whether governments can mitigate the fallout from potentially the worst global economic shock in at least a generation.

“Right now, we can only project a picture of the second quarter: soaring demand in server chips may offset slump in display, mobile and consumer electronics,” said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “The problem is, if the Covid-19 pandemic continues further, we can’t guarantee that the uptrend in expansion of servers will be sustainable in the second half of this year.”

Samsung’s Symptom-Less Earnings Don’t Make It Immune: Tim Culpan

As the world’s largest maker of memory chips, phones, displays and appliances, Samsung is broadly exposed to the economic shocks of Covid-19. Despite Tuesday’s rally, the company’s shares remain down about a fifth since their January 2020 peak. The better-than-expected result unveiled Tuesday was helped by the South Korean won weakening about 5% against the dollar in the first quarter, lifting the value of income repatriated from overseas.

Should the pandemic persist into the second half -- a worst-case scenario -- the tech giant foresees missing its own 2020 revenue projections by a double-digit percentage, according to people familiar with internal discussions. It’s grappling with plant shutdowns and store closures this quarter alongside rivals and customers like Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. At the same time, memory chipmakers have experienced rising demand and prices for DRAM and flash memory used in data centers and cloud service operators.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Samsung Electronics’ strong 1Q operating profit beat may affirm rival Micron’s upbeat expectations for memory chip demand, despite the Covid-19 outbreak. DRAM contract prices rose in March after reaching a bottom in December, while those for NAND inched up from late 3Q. Chipmakers’ wafer cuts may tighten supply and restore inventory to normal levels.

- Anthea Lai, analyst

Click here for the research.

Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules rose roughly 12% in the March quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc. Prices for 128-gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips increased about 5.6% in the first three months of 2020. Thanks to growing demand for online services from video-conferences to e-commerce and gaming, prices of server DRAM and enterprise SSD or solid-state drives are projected to keep growing in the current quarter. TrendForce raised its price-growth forecasts on server DRAM to 20%, while it expects enterprise SSD prices to rise by as much as 15%.

“The growing demand for server DRAM led to low inventory levels for both clients and suppliers,” TrendForce said in an April 1 note. “Also, following a new round of tenders from Chinese telecom operators in February, the supply of server DRAM has become much tighter, in turn maintaining the upward pull on server DRAM prices.”

Samsung’s hardest-hit business was mobile because of disappointing demand for S20 devices released in early March. In the first quarter, the company shut its key Gumi plant several times after discovering infection among employees, prompting the shift of some of output to Vietnam. Lockdowns of major cities and store closures across North America have depressed overall business. Hana Financial Investment expects Samsung to report 62.2 million unit shipments of smartphones for the first quarter of 2020, compared with 71.5 million units a year earlier.

“Although semiconductor earnings look set to increase on the back of memory chip price hikes, the divisions selling finished products” will likely see their earnings decline, said Greg Roh, senior vice president at HMC Securities.

589,2020-03-30T23:02:07+00:00,Buying What the Fed Buys,"On Monday, March 23, the Federal Reserve announced a series of aggressive stimulus measures to combat the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy.

""Aggressive effort must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and income and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,"" the Fed said in a press release. The stimulus measures include the following:

Unlimited purchasing of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Lending up to $300 billion to employers, consumers and businesses. Establishing additional credit facilities to lend to large employers. Increasing the flow of credit to municipalities. Establishing a facility to lend to certain small and medium-sized businesses. Purchasing investment-grade corporate bonds.

Businesses that receive Fed support through any of the above measures are likely to recover more quickly from the economic crisis. This is especially true now that the central bank is purchasing corporate debt, which will make things easier for specific companies more than the economy at large.

When there is a large uptick in demand for a company's assets, share prices will typically rise. Thus, regardless of whether U.S. stocks have hit the bottom or whether they still have room to fall before recovering, investors may want to consider buying what the Fed is buying when it comes to debt and equity markets.

Corporate debt

When purchasing corporate debt, the Fed is not likely to pick and choose which debt it buys based on a company's long-term stock price prospects, as doing so would serve to unbalance the economy more than help it.

Instead, the central bank has pledged to purchase up to 20% of the assets of U.S.-listed bond exchange-traded funds, which provide broad, passive exposure to investment-grade bonds. ETFs also have the advantage of being more liquid than bonds, which is an essential quality when the goal is to stimulate markets as quickly as possible.

Story continues

In general, securities listed on ETFs tend to trade at higher prices relative to intrinsic value than their non-ETF counterparts. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the companies whose common stock together makes up approximately 18% of the S&P 500 Index, all have trailing 12-month price-earnings ratios above 20 as of March 30. Of the five, only Apple has a current price-earnings ratio below 20 at 19.98. 3753a77c6888bbb89a73003a90ac5854.png

With the central bank potentially boosting the demand for bond ETFs by up to 20%, any of these ETFs that it purchases will most likely see a corresponding increase in value. In light of this, which bond ETFs is the Fed most likely to purchase?

One likely candidate is the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond (LQD) ETF, which purchases investment-grade corporate bonds that have a weighted average maturity of around 13 years. With a market cap of $38.08 billion and a dividend yield of 3.39%, the LQD ETF is up 3% over the past year and down approximately 6% since U.S. markets peaked in mid-February. 43a4b86986ab9b7e6657d4b85a51a705.png

The iShares ETFs are run by BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, which has agreed to cooperate with the New York Fed by not charging it fees on its ETFs. There are also plans for BlackRock to lead two corporate credit facilities for the Fed, one for existing bonds and one for new bonds.

The iShares 1-3 Year Credit Bond ETF (NASDAQ:IGSB) is another BlackRock ETF for investment-grade corporate bonds, focusing on shorter-term debt with an average remaining maturity of one to three years. It has a market cap of $12.63 billion and a dividend yield of 3.13%. The ETF is up 1% over the past year and down 3% since mid-February. 8d41334a10f3c260870482b8efd70061.png

Other investment-grade corporate bond ETFs include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCIT) ETF, the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCSH) ETF and the SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond (SPIB) ETF.

Top of the ETFs

In terms of specific companies, the ones that will benefit the most from these bond ETF purchases are the ones that are present in these ETFs. Naturally, companies without investment-grade debt will not benefit from this form of monetary stimulus.

The largest company holdings of the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and several similar ETFs are the big six U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS). While the current target interest rate of 0% to 0.25% does not bode well for the short-term profitability of banks, the banking industry will likely see gains again if the Fed eventually raises interest rates.

Other top investment-grade corporate bond ETF holdings include Apple, Microsoft, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). These giants are on the forefront of tech and communications infrastructure, and their common stocks are also common ETF holdings.

Non-cyclical consumer companies also take up a significant portion of these ETFs. For example, three of the top 10 bonds of the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF are for CVS Health Corp. (CVS). AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) bonds hold a top 10 spot in several of this type of ETF, including the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF.

Venturing into stocks

Some analysts speculate that in addition to corporate debt ETFs, the Fed will follow the Bank of Japan's lead and enter the stock market by purchasing shares of common stock, most likely through ETFs as well.

A ""whatever it takes"" attitude could possibly lead to this, if existing stimulus measures are not enough. After all, with interest rates at zero, the Fed's most powerful economic stimulus tool has already been exhausted.

On the March 6 meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, a board of economists that watches over Fed activities, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said, ""We should allow the central bank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets.""

Keep in mind that this possibility is completely speculative as of the writing of this article. Before the Fed could buy stocks, it would need to get congressional approval. However, with the Fed unleashing unprecedented stimulus measures, some analysts speculate that it will become even more aggressive in its policies if markets continue to worsen.

Conclusion

With the Fed becoming active in the economy at unprecedented levels, investors may need to give the institution some weight in their considerations of the companies that will be affected by its decisions.

Long story short, the Fed becoming involved enough in corporate debt to buy up to 20% of investment-grade corporate debt ETFs means that investment-grade companies will be getting a leg up over those with lower credit ratings. This comes at a time when increasing corporate debt in the U.S. has led to waves of credit downgrades, meaning that debt is becoming more concentrated at the top.

590,2020-03-30T08:12:40+00:00,Apple supplier Foxconn's profit down 24% in last quarter of 2019,"TAIPEI, March 30 (Reuters) - Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 23.7% fall in profit in the last three months of 2019 on Monday as it braces for the impact from the coronavirus pandemic that has hit demand from key customers such as Apple.

Foxconn, which assembles iPhones at factories in China, reported net profit of T$47.76 billion ($1.6 billion), according to Reuters calculations, slightly above an average forecast of T$46.94 billion from 14 analysts compiled by Refinitiv.

The world's largest contract electronics manufacturer did not given any explanation for the decline from T$62.61 billion in the same period a year earlier.

Foxconn is among manufacturers worldwide grappling with the fallout from coronavirus restrictions that have disrupted supply chains and hurt demand.

Apple, its biggest client, rescinded its outlook for the first quarter of 2020 saying manufacturing in China had taken longer than expected to resume amid travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break.

Foxconn warned this month that revenue would fall more than 15% in businesses including consumer electronics in the first quarter. But it said revenue would recover thereafter as production returns to normal in virus-hit China.

Foxconn reported its biggest monthly drop in revenue in about seven years in February as the outbreak continued to play havoc with its business.

Shares in the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, have fallen more than 12% this year.

591,2020-03-27T10:43:42+00:00,Coronavirus Is Expediting iPhone Makers' Plans to Move Beyond China,"(Bloomberg) -- Wistron Corp., one of Apple’s manufacturing partners, said this week half its capacity could reside outside China within a year. The declaration underscored how the Asian assemblers that keep the world supplied with iPhones and other gadgets are shifting to a higher gear after the coronavirus showed the folly of staking everything on one country.

The move in production out of China has been underway since the trade war between Washington and Beijing reached its zenith last year. Now, Covid-19 is expediting that. Decisions by companies like Wistron and other Apple Inc. partners including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Inventec Corp. and Pegatron Corp., could re-shape tech supply chains.

Taipei-listed Wistron is targeting India -- where it’s already making some iPhones -- along with Vietnam and Mexico, setting aside $1 billion to fund the expansion this year and next. “We understand from a lot of messages from our customers that they believe this is something we have to do,” Chairman Simon Lin said on an earnings call. “They’re happy and appreciate that we can continue to make such a move and they will continue to work with us.”

IPhone assembler Pegatron is also diversifying manufacturing sites, including by adding capacity back home in Taiwan. Chief Executive Officer Liao Syh-jang said Thursday the company hopes to kick-start manufacturing operations in Vietnam in 2021 after setting up a new plant in Indonesia last year, and it’s further looking at India as a location for new facilities. It said on Friday it had agreed to purchase land and a plant in northern Taiwan.

Apple’s main assembly partner for AirPods, Inventec, said Tuesday it’s preparing to establish a unit in Vietnam.

More than any other assembler, Hon Hai encapsulated how the coronavirus brought the world’s No. 2 economy to a standstill. Better known as Foxconn, it augurs a potential shift in a global production paradigm that’s governed the electronics industry well over three decades. The company also has facilities in India, where it began churning out iPhones last year, and Vietnam. “Trade, the virus, all these things will make the world very different in the next decade,” Alex Yang, the company’s investors relations chief, told investors in a recent call.

It’s unlikely that China will fully give up its place as the world’s electronics workshop anytime soon. That’s because it’s difficult to replicate the intricate network of suppliers, competent workers, efficient distribution systems and large home market that the country offers. Large-scale relocation of manufacturing capabilities would also take time. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in late February that the company wasn’t looking to make any quick moves out of China in light of virus-related supply-chain interruptions. “We’re talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale, fundamental change,” he said.

Still, the outward-bound trend is accelerating, especially among smaller-scale manufacturers. That extends to gadget makers serving customers other than Apple. Meiloon Industrial Co., which makes speakers and counts Harman International Industries Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. among its clients, said it’s seeking alternatives to China-based production and speeding up a move of capacity to places like Taiwan and Indonesia, spokesperson Eva Kuo said in a phone interview.

The singularly trying experience of dealing with the outbreak in China will reverberate well after Covid-19 subsides, raising questions about the globalized business model of modern corporations. “It’s a wake-up call,” Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told Bloomberg Television last month. “China was a given, it was the perfect infrastructure for us to source and buy from there, and to sell. Now of course we have to reconsider scenarios, how to deal with China in the future.”

592,2020-03-27T04:24:19+00:00,Olympics delay deals setback to Samsung's plans to win over Japan market,"By Hyunjoo Jin

SEOUL (Reuters) - For Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were going to be its springboard to attain a long-held goal - making significant inroads into Japan's lucrative smartphone market where Apple Inc <AAPL.O> dominates.

But after the Games were postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the long-time sponsor's marketing plans - centered on its new S20 smartphone now out too early - have gone awry.

The delay may also mean the South Korean tech giant has lost a crucial window of opportunity. It had been expected to tout its 5G capability in its Olympics ads, aiming to attract a population excited to watch the Games with cutting-edge technology before Apple had a 5G product on the market.

""Samsung was keen to use the Olympics opportunity to get it right in Japan. In that sense, it's a bad situation,"" a person familiar with Samsung's operations told Reuters, noting that Samsung and other sponsors would have to adjust plans.

""A lot of the momentum for smartphone demand in the lead-up to the Olympics will also be gone,"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.

Former Samsung officials and analysts said Samsung will likely go back to the drawing board to promote a new flagship phone due out next year.

When asked about the impact of the Olympics postponement on its strategy for the Japan market, Samsung declined to comment, saying only it would continue to provide innovative technology for Japanese customers regardless of when the Games commence.

Samsung may be the world's No. 1 smartphone maker by volume but it has just a fraction of the Japanese market.

In contrast, Apple which first began selling the iPhone in Japan in 2008, gained share thanks to an aggressive advertising and pricing campaign from SoftBank <9984.T> - at the time its sole distributor. Japan has since become a loyal premium market and key profit center for the U.S. firm.

Story continues

Apple currently commands 53% of the Japanese market, Sharp Corp <6753.T> has 12% and Sony Corp <6758.T> has 7%, according to Counterpoint Research. Samsung, which has lost ground since 2013, has 4%.

HARAJUKU HOPES

Indicative of Samsung's struggles was its 2015 decision to drop its name from smartphones sold in Japan and just go with Galaxy branding - the only market where it does so. It's a move some analysts attribute to historical tensions that often flare up between South Korea and its neighbor.

""I believe they did so due to the growing number of Japanese consumers who take political factors into account in their purchase considerations,"" said Shengtao Jin, a research analyst at Canalys.

In its run at Apple's stronghold, Samsung had laid the groundwork for a concerted campaign.

In March last year, it opened the world's biggest Galaxy store in Harajuku, Tokyo's popular shopping district for youth fashion and pop culture. Boasting eight floors, the glitzy building has an exterior decorated with more than 1,000 smartphones. Samsung's mobile and network division chief Koh Dong-jin, officials from the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organizers attended the opening ceremony to mark 500 days until the Games.

Then in May, Samsung's heir and de facto head, Jay. Y Lee traveled to Japan, meeting with executives from mobile carriers NTT DoCoMo Inc <9437.T> and KDDI Corp <9433.T> to discuss 5G cooperation.

DoCoMo and SoftBank Corp <9434.T>, the domestic telecom arm of SoftBank Group, are currently rolling out 5G services. But the delay of the Games means 5G is not expected to gain momentum until Apple launches a 5G-capable iPhone, analysts said.

That phone is expected to arrive by end-2020, though some media reports have said it may be delayed by the pandemic.

""Samsung could have taken an early lead in 5G but the Games postponement is a setback,"" said Jeong Ok-hyun, a former LG mobile executive and a professor at Sogang University in Seoul.

""The virus could also lead to delays in the development of the 5G market, which will be a relief to Apple.""

For the time being, it remains to be seen if Samsung will proceed with plans to sell a special Olympics edition S20 phone with 5G capability. The phone to be sold by DoCoMo was due to be launched in June and Samsung began taking pre-orders this month.

Asked if the plan is on track, Samsung said details will be determined after discussions with the IOC and DoCoMo.

593,2020-03-24T13:20:27+00:00,Are Sporting Goods Essential in a Pandemic?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- You really can’t blame Mike Ashley for trying.

The billionaire founder of Frasers Group Plc tried to keep his sporting goods stores open, arguing that they provided essential supplies of fitness equipment to self-isolating Britons. The retailer has since made a U-turn, closing its Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores on Tuesday as the U.K.’s nationwide lockdown took effect.

Ashley may be everyone’s favorite pantomime villain — and his brash attempt to keep stores open prompted a backlash from politicians — but as usual, the entrepreneur isn’t totally off point. People around the world are asking themselves exactly what they may need to stay healthy and sane as they hunker down at home to ride out the coronavirus crisis.

There seems to be some logic missing in the categories that the British government has deemed essential and non-essential. Some are obvious: supermarkets and pharmacies, for example, should stay open. Clothing shops are clearly far less necessary. Many, including Next Plc, Arcadia Group Ltd.’s Topshop and Primark, the budget fashion chain owned by Associated Foods Plc, had already closed their doors.

But other categories are more ambiguous. Why are bicycle shops deemed more essential than electronics and home appliance retailers? Dixons Carphone Plc was among the chains lobbying to be given essential status. The group has now shuttered stores. (Frasers closed Evans Cycles anyway while seeking more clarity from the government.)

The government argues that bicycle shops are crucial to help workers get around while avoiding public transport. But surely with many Britons now forced to work from home, it’s also imperative for people to be able to buy computer and phone gear they didn’t know they really needed until now. If they’re out buying food, shouldn’t they be able to buy a cable or a printer too? And what if the washing machine breaks? Many large electronics and appliance stores are conveniently located in the same retail parks as supermarkets.

Story continues

True, people can order via the internet, and many sales will indeed migrate to this channel. But there is a danger that with so many online orders for essential items, delivery capacity for anything else won’t be able to keep up.

And filling one’s virtual supermarket shopping cart with things like an extension cord or two, in order to collect it from their local store, risks putting more pressure on staff who are busy filling shelves with staple items and keeping up with an influx of panic-buyers.

Kingfisher Plc, which owns B&Q in the U.K. and Castorama in France, has closed its U.K. DIY estate while it looks to find the best ways to still provide essential items. Its Screwfix business, which serves tradesmen, has moved to “click and collect” only. That may be a model worth trying to alleviate some of the issues created by the lockdown, as well as opening only a limited number of stores as Halfords Plc is set to do. This could ensure much needed goods are available while discouraging shopping sprees.

The debate about the right approach to take comes as retailers are facing a catastrophic loss of trade. Trying to do everything to salvage some sales is only logical. Especially as the shutdown could not have come at a worst time with quarterly rent payments due tomorrow.

Of course retailers that do stay open must be conscious of protecting not only customers, by respecting social distancing best practices, but also their own staff, who need gloves and masks for example. At some point the virus will abate, and chains will want to emerge with their reputation in tact.

But it’s a difficult balance to strike. And it is one that chains in the U.S. are facing as well as the virus case count increases there, although many companies, including Nike Inc., Apple Inc. and L Brands Inc.’s Bath & Bodyworks, have already closed their stores.

It’s important the government help British chains find the equilibrium they need to weather this crisis.

594,2020-03-23T11:40:29+00:00,3 ETFs To Short The Dow,"With last Friday's 4.55% slide, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased all of the gains accrued since President Trump won the 2016 election. Using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA) as the guide, the blue-chip index enters Monday 35.14% below its 52-week high.

Traders considering bearish and inverse leveraged exchange traded funds on the Dow would clearly be onto something, particularly with Dow futures swooning again Sunday evening. Things are so bad in fact for the index to start 2020 that each of the benchmark's 30 components are in the red and 25 of those stocks are down 20% or more.

That could be a sign the once beloved Dow could be in for more near-term downside, bringing with it opportunity in the following bearish ETFs.

See Also: The Most Shorted ETFs Amid The Coronavirus Market Crash

ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG)

The ProShares Short Dow30 (NYSE: DOG) is a good idea for risk-averse investors that are looking for short-term hedges or to participate in some of the broader market's downside. DOG is an inverse though not leveraged fund, meaning it should deliver a gain of 1% on a day in which the Dow loses 1%.

With Boeing's (NYSE: BA) rapid fall from grace, DOG is now an interesting way of hedging long bets in stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH), which are now the Dow's top two stocks.

Remember that the Dow is a price-weighted, not a cap-weighted index, meaning the stock with the largest price tag takes on the largest weight in the in benchmark.

ProShares UltraPro Short Dow30 (SDOW)

Some bearish leveraged ETFs are thriving in the current environment and the ProShares UltraPro Short Dow30 (NYSE: SDOW) is certainly part of that club. Last Friday, SDOW gain 12.83% on nearly double the average daily volume, meaning the bearish Dow fund has more than doubled just this month. That's tempting, but traders should still treat SDOG as they would any other leveraged ETF.

Story continues

“Due to the compounding of daily returns, holding periods of greater than one day can result in returns that are significantly different than the target return and ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period,” according to ProShares.

Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (TECS)

Clearly, the first two bearish ETFs highlighted here are dedicated Dow plays. Obviously, the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS) is an inverse technology play and not focused on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

However, there are relevant tie ins. With Boeing's slide, the industrial sector is losing prominence in the Dow while tech is now the benchmark's biggest sector weight at 24.44%.

TECS looks to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, a benchmark that devotes almost 40% of its weight to Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That index is also home to four more Dow components: Visa (NYSE: V), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Cisco (NYSE: CSCO) and IBM (NYSE: IBM).

So yes, TECS is a fine way for active traders to put on short-term, bearish Dow positions.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Both demand for Apple’s iPhones and its pricing power in greater China were negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. Because Apple discounted the price of replacement batteries for certain iPhone models, a decision made due to the revelation that the Company was purposefully degrading the battery performance of these products, customers were replacing their batteries instead of purchasing a new iPhone, impacting sales growth. Apple slashed production of 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce its current inventory. The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Join the case to recover your losses.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The case, City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales.

On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019—a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Class Action Deadline: Bernstein Liebhard LLP Announces That Two Weeks Remain to Make a Motion for Lead Plaintiff in a Class Action Against Apple -- AAPL","NEW YORK, June  03, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP announced today that two weeks remain to make a motion for lead plaintiff in a class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all persons or entities (the “Class”) who purchased the common stock of Apple Inc. (“Apple” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the period between August 1, 2017 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

If you purchased Apple securities, and/or would like to discuss your legal rights and options, please visit Apple class action or contact Matthew E. Guarnero toll free at (877) 779-1414 or via email at MGuarnero@bernlieb.com.

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff in the Apple class action, you must move the court no later than June 17, 2019.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery does not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you take no action, you may remain an absent class member.

Apple designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, consumer software, and online services.  The Company’s most well-known products include the iPad tablet, the Mac personal computer, and the iPhone smartphone.  The iPhone was responsible for generating nearly two-thirds of Apple’s revenue in 2018.

On January 23, 2017, Apple released a software update which secretly slowed the performance of certain iPhones with battery-related issues.  Throughout 2017, these undisclosed intentional slowdowns led consumers to prematurely believe their devices had become obsolete, leading them to upgrade their iPhones at a fast rate.  Beginning on August 1, 2017, Apple began to report a record number of iPhone upgrades.  In December 2017, Apple revealed it had been intentionally slowing down certain iPhones, also disclosing that the problem was battery-related, as opposed to device-related.  Following this revelation, Apple offered discounted replacement batteries throughout 2018 in light of public outrage.

Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period, Defendants misled investors by making materially false and misleading statements as each of the Defendants knew and failed to disclose or deliberately disregarded that: (1) the intentional slowdown of certain model iPhones, unsustainably boosted iPhone sales during 2017 and cannibalized future sales; (2) the Company’s replacement battery program during 2018 (enacted as a direct and primary response to the Company’s intentional phone throttling during 2017) was negatively impacting iPhone sales; and (3) the U.S.-China trade war, declining Chinese economy, and strength of the U.S. dollar had negatively impacted demand for iPhones in Greater China.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues would be $84 billion – approximately $5 billion below the low-end of the forecasted range that the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018, due to falling iPhone sales in China.  China is Apple’s third-largest market for iPhones behind only the United States and Europe.  The Company also admitted that price cuts to replacement batteries, stemming from the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally reducing the performance of batteries in older iPhones, was negatively impacting iPhone sales growth.

On this news, Apple common stock fell more than $15 per share, or over 9%, to close at $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019.

The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Both demand for Apple’s iPhones and its pricing power in greater China were negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. Because Apple discounted the price of replacement batteries for certain iPhone models, a decision made due to the revelation that the Company was purposefully degrading the battery performance of these products, customers were replacing their batteries instead of purchasing a new iPhone, impacting sales growth. Apple slashed production of 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce its current inventory. The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Investor Deadline: Bernstein Liebhard LLP Announces That 19 Days Remain to Make a Motion for Lead Plaintiff in a Class Action Against Apple -- AAPL","NEW YORK, May  29, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP announced today that nineteen days remain to make a motion for lead plaintiff in a class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all persons or entities (the “Class”) who purchased the common stock of Apple Inc. (“Apple” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the period between August 1, 2017 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff in the Apple class action, you must move the court no later than June 17, 2019.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery does not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you take no action, you may remain an absent class member.

Apple designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, consumer software, and online services.  The Company’s most well-known products include the iPad tablet, the Mac personal computer, and the iPhone smartphone.  The iPhone was responsible for generating nearly two-thirds of Apple’s revenue in 2018.

On January 23, 2017, Apple released a software update which secretly slowed the performance of certain iPhones with battery-related issues.  Throughout 2017, these undisclosed intentional slowdowns led consumers to prematurely believe their devices had become obsolete, leading them to upgrade their iPhones at a fast rate.  Beginning on August 1, 2017, Apple began to report a record number of iPhone upgrades.  In December 2017, Apple revealed it had been intentionally slowing down certain iPhones, also disclosing that the problem was battery-related, as opposed to device-related.  Following this revelation, Apple offered discounted replacement batteries throughout 2018 in light of public outrage.

Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period, Defendants misled investors by making materially false and misleading statements as each of the Defendants knew and failed to disclose or deliberately disregarded that: (1) the intentional slowdown of certain model iPhones, unsustainably boosted iPhone sales during 2017 and cannibalized future sales; (2) the Company’s replacement battery program during 2018 (enacted as a direct and primary response to the Company’s intentional phone throttling during 2017) was negatively impacting iPhone sales; and (3) the U.S.-China trade war, declining Chinese economy, and strength of the U.S. dollar had negatively impacted demand for iPhones in Greater China.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues would be $84 billion – approximately $5 billion below the low-end of the forecasted range that the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018, due to falling iPhone sales in China.  China is Apple’s third-largest market for iPhones behind only the United States and Europe.  The Company also admitted that price cuts to replacement batteries, stemming from the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally reducing the performance of batteries in older iPhones, was negatively impacting iPhone sales growth.

On this news, Apple common stock fell more than $15 per share, or over 9%, to close at $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019.

(“Apple” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) for violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Both demand for Apple’s iPhones and its pricing power in greater China were negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. Because Apple discounted the price of replacement batteries for certain iPhone models, a decision made due to the revelation that the Company was purposefully degrading the battery performance of these products, customers were replacing their batteries instead of purchasing a new iPhone, impacting sales growth. Apple slashed production of 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce its current inventory. The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Join the case to recover your losses.

(“Apple” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) and certain of its officers.  The class action, filed in United States District Court, for the Northern District of California, and indexed under 19-cv-02615, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Apple securities between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019, inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to pursue remedies under §§ 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

If you are a shareholder who purchased Apple securities during the class period, you have until June 17, 2019, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.  A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.  To discuss this action, contact Robert S.

Apple is a multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.  The Company’s most well-known products include its iconic iPhone smartphones, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies.  Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China, one of Apple’s most important growth markets; (ii) the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones rather than purchasing new iPhones was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (iii) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; (iv) unit sales for iPhone and other hardware was relevant to investors and the Company’s financial performance, and the decision to withhold such unit sales was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product; (v) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis in fact when issuing the Company’s revenue outlook for 1Q19 and/or making the related statements concerning demand for its products, as Apple’s business metrics and financial prospects were not as strong as Defendants had led the market to believe; and (vi) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple shocked the market when it disclosed the true state of its actual 1Q19 iPhone sales, particularly in China.  For the first time during Cook’s tenure as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Apple would miss its public revenue projections and the miss was up to $9 billion.  The Company would admit that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales.

This news caused the market price of Apple common stock to plunge, closing down more than $15 per share, or more than 9%, from its close of $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to close at $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019, on unusually high volume of more than 90 million shares traded.

(AAPL) and Certain Executives,"NEW YORK, May  24, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Labaton Sucharow LLP (“Labaton Sucharow”) announces that on May 24, 2019, it filed a securities class action lawsuit, captioned Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Plan v. Apple Inc., No. 19-cv-2891 (N.D. Cal.) (the “Action”), on behalf of its client Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Plan (“Steamfitters”) against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) (“Apple” or the “Company”) and certain officers and directors (collectively, “Defendants”).  The Steamfitters Action asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, on behalf of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired Apple securities during the period from August 1, 2017 through January 2, 2019, inclusive (the “Class Period”), who were damaged thereby (the “Class”).

The Action expands upon the substantially related cases City of Roseville Employees Retirement System v. Apple Inc., No. 19-cv-2033 (N.D. Cal.), asserting Exchange Act claims on behalf of all purchasers of Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019; and Reddy v. Apple Inc., No. 19-cv-2615 (N.D. Cal.), asserting Exchange Act claims on behalf of all purchasers of Apple securities between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019.  Pursuant to the notice published on April 16, 2019 in connection with the first-filed case, as required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, investors wishing to serve as Lead Plaintiff are required to file a motion for appointment as Lead Plaintiff by no later than June 17, 2019.

Apple is a multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.  The Company’s most profitable product is the iPhone smartphone, which since 2012 has represented more than 40 percent of the Company’s revenue.  China is the Company’s third-largest market, and most important growth market, yet is susceptible to geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and increased competition from emerging Chinese smartphone manufacturers.

On January 23, 2017, Apple released a software update which secretly slowed the performance of certain iPhones with battery-related issues.  Throughout 2017, these undisclosed intentional slowdowns led consumers to prematurely believe their devices had become obsolete, leading them to upgrade their iPhones at a fast rate.  Specifically, beginning in August 1, 2017, Apple began to report a record number of iPhone upgrades.  In December 2017, Apple revealed it had been intentionally slowing down certain iPhones, also disclosing that the problem was battery-related, as opposed to device-related.  Following this revelation, Apple offered discounted replacement batteries throughout 2018 in light of public outrage.

The Steamfitters Action alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants misled investors by making materially false and misleading statements as each of the Defendants knew and failed to disclose or deliberately disregarded that: (1) the intentional slowdown of certain model iPhones, unsustainably boosted iPhone sales during 2017 and cannibalized future sales; (2) the Company’s replacement battery program during 2018 (enacted as a direct and primary response to the Company’s intentional phone throttling during 2017) was negatively impacting iPhone sales; and (3) the U.S.-China trade war, declining Chinese economy, and strength of the U.S. dollar had negatively impacted demand for iPhones in Greater China.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, for the first time in fifteen years Apple slashed its prior quarterly revenue forecast for its already complete first fiscal quarter 2019.  On this date, Defendants disclosed that the Company’s revenues for its first fiscal quarter 2019 were only $84 billion, substantially below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced eight weeks earlier.  Defendants attributed these results to declining iPhone sales, in part, due to more consumers purchasing discounted replacement batteries in lieu of upgrading their iPhones, and the decelerating Chinese economy and U.S.-China trade war impacting iPhone demand in Greater China.  On this news, Apple common stock fell precipitously by more than $15 per share, or more than 9 percent, to close at $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Apple securities during the Class Period and were damaged thereby, you are a member of the “Class” and may be able to seek appointment as Lead Plaintiff.  Lead Plaintiff motion papers must be filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California no later than June 17, 2019. The Lead Plaintiff is a court-appointed representative for absent members of the Class.  You do not need to seek appointment as Lead Plaintiff to share in any Class recovery in the Action.  If you are a Class member and there is a recovery for the Class, you can share in that recovery as an absent Class member.  You may retain counsel of your choice to represent you in the Action.

611,2019-05-22T15:52:00+00:00,Bernstein Liebhard LLP Announces That Approximately Three Weeks Remain to Make a Motion For Lead Plaintiff in a Class Action Against Apple Inc. -- AAPL,"NEW YORK, May  22, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP announced today that approximately three weeks remain to make a motion for lead plaintiff in a class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all persons or entities (the “Class”) who purchased the common stock of Apple Inc. (“Apple” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the period between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff in the Apple class action, you must move the court no later than June 17, 2019.  A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery does not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you take no action, you may remain an absent class member.

Apple designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, consumer software, and online services.  The Company’s most well-known products include the iPad tablet, the Mac personal computer, and the iPhone smartphone.  The iPhone was responsible for generating nearly two-thirds of Apple’s revenue in 2018.

The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Apple’s business and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (b) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (c) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (d) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the iPhone.  As a result defendants’ failure to disclose this information, the price of Apple stock was artificially inflated during the Class Period.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues would be $84 billion - approximately $5 billion below the low-end of the forecasted range that the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018, due to falling iPhone sales in China.  China is Apple’s third-largest market for iPhones behind only the United States and Europe.  The Company also admitted that price cuts to replacement batteries, stemming from the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally reducing the performance of batteries in older iPhones, was negatively impacting iPhone sales growth.

On this news, Apple common stock fell more than $15 per share, or over 9%, to close at $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The case, City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales.

On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019—a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

(“Apple” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) for violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investors who purchased the Company's shares between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019, inclusive (the ''Class Period''), are encouraged to contact the firm before June 17, 2019.

The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Both demand for Apple’s iPhones and its pricing power in greater China were negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. Because Apple discounted the price of replacement batteries for certain iPhone models, a decision made due to the revelation that the Company was purposefully degrading the battery performance of these products, customers were replacing their batteries instead of purchasing a new iPhone, impacting sales growth. Apple slashed production of 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce its current inventory. The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Join the case to recover your losses.

(“Apple” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) for violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investors who purchased the Company's shares between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019, inclusive (the ''Class Period''), are encouraged to contact the firm before June 17, 2019.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Both demand for Apple’s iPhones and its pricing power in greater China were negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. Because Apple discounted the price of replacement batteries for certain iPhone models, a decision made due to the revelation that the Company was purposefully degrading the battery performance of these products, customers were replacing their batteries instead of purchasing a new iPhone, impacting sales growth. Apple slashed production of 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce its current inventory. The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Join the case to recover your losses.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The case, City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales.

On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019—a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Apple’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The lawsuit alleges that Defendants failed to disclose that: (a) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (b) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (c) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (d) Defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the iPhone.  On January 2, 2019, Apple disclosed that first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues would be $84 billion – approximately $5 billion below the low-end of the forecasted range that the company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018, due to falling iPhone sales in China.  On this news, the price of Apple common stock fell more than 9%.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) (“Apple” or the “Company”) securities during the period between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 inclusive (the “Class Period”).  Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until June 17, 2019 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.

626,2019-04-25T21:08:00+00:00,Bernstein Liebhard LLP Announces That Approximately Seven Weeks Remain to Make a Motion for Lead Plaintiff in a Class Against Apple Inc.,"NEW YORK, April  25, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bernstein Liebhard LLP announced today that approximately seven weeks remain to make a motion for lead plaintiff in an Apple class action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all persons or entities (the “Class”) who purchased the common stock of Apple Inc. (“Apple” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the period between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Apple designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, consumer software, and online services.  The Company’s most well-known products include the iPad tablet, the Mac personal computer, and the iPhone smartphone.  The iPhone was responsible for generating nearly two-thirds of Apple’s revenue in 2018.

The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Apple’s business and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (b) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (c) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (d) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the iPhone.  As a result defendants’ failure to disclose this information, the price of Apple stock was artificially inflated during the Class Period.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues would be $84 billion - approximately $5 billion below the low-end of the forecasted range that the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018, due to falling iPhone sales in China.  China is Apple’s third-largest market for iPhones behind only the United States and Europe.  The Company also admitted that price cuts to replacement batteries, stemming from the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally reducing the performance of batteries in older iPhones, was negatively impacting iPhone sales growth.

On this news, Apple common stock fell more than $15 per share, or over 9%, to close at $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019.

Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all Class members who invested in Apple common stock during the Class Period.  If you invested in Apple common stock as described above, and lost money on the transactions, you may wish to join in this action to serve as lead plaintiff.  In order to do so, you must meet certain requirements set forth in the applicable law and file appropriate papers no later than June 17, 2019.

A “lead plaintiff” is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.  In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the court must determine that the class member’s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class.  Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as lead plaintiff.  Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.  You may retain Bernstein Liebhard LLP, or other counsel of your choice, to serve as your counsel in this action.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The case, City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales.

On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019—a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Apple’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Both demand for Apple’s iPhones and its pricing power in greater China were negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. Because Apple discounted the price of replacement batteries for certain iPhone models, a decision made due to the revelation that the Company was purposefully degrading the battery performance of these products, customers were replacing their batteries instead of purchasing a new iPhone, impacting sales growth. Apple slashed production of 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce its current inventory. The Company also withheld unit sales for iPhones and other products, a metric long used by investors to judge the Company’s performance, in order to mask the decline in sales of the iPhone, Apple’s most prominent product. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Apple, investors suffered damages.

Join the case to recover your losses.

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: www.bgandg.com/aapl.

This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Apple’s business and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (b) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (c) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (d) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product. As a result of this information being withheld from the market during the Class Period, the price of Apple stock was artificially inflated to more than $209 per share.

Then on January 2, 2019, post-close, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in over 14 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third largest market after USA and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced eight weeks previously on November 1, 2018. The Company also disclosed that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales. This news caused the market price of Apple common stock to decline more than $15 per share, or more than 9%, from a close of $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to a close of $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Apple common stock between November 2, 2018 and January 2, 2019 (the “Class Period”).  The case, City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 19-cv-2033 was filed on April 16, 2019.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the U.S.-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple’s pricing power in greater China; (2) due to Apple discounting the cost of replacement batteries to make up for the Company’s prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones, the rate at which Apple customers were replacing their batteries in older iPhones, rather than purchasing new iPhones, was negatively impacting Apple’s iPhone sales growth; (3) as a result of slowing demand, Apple had slashed production orders from suppliers for the new 2018 iPhone models and cut prices to reduce inventory; and (4) defendants’ decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the Company’s financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the Company’s flagship product.

On January 2, 2019, after the close of trading, Apple disclosed that, for the first time in 15 years, Apple would miss its prior quarterly revenue forecast amid falling iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. The Company announced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of only $84 billion, far below the expected range of $89 billion to $93 billion the Company had announced just eight weeks earlier on November 1, 2018. The Company also admitted that in addition to macroeconomics in the Chinese market, the price cuts to battery replacements a year earlier to fix the Company’s prior surreptitious conduct had hurt iPhone sales.

On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $157.92 per share on January 2, 2019 to $142.19 per share on January 3, 2019—a $15.62 or 9.96% drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Apple’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The RT100 is based on more than 230,000 individual ratings collected in the first quarter of 2018. It includes comparative rankings, demographic trends, and unique insights into the dynamics behind reputational impact. The global study shows what drives trust and identifies supportive behaviors such as intent to purchase a company’s products, willingness to invest in, or even work for, the company.

Rankings dropped for 58 percent of companies in the RT100. Aligned with the decline in reputation, garnering support among stakeholders has become more difficult for companies; expectations have risen, making it harder to earn trust, attain benefit of the doubt, create consumer loyalty and entice investors.

“The reputation bubble has burst. Companies are down by an average of 1.4 points globally, representing the first major decline since the end of the Great Recession,” said Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, Executive Partner and Chief Research Officer for Reputation Institute.

 RI measures the reputation of thousands of companies on an annual basis using its RepTrak® framework. Its Global RT100 study measures the most highly regarded and familiar multinational companies in 15 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

About Reputation Institute Reputation Institute powers the world’s most reputable companies. By tracking and analyzing stakeholder perceptions, we unleash the power of reputation to enable leaders to build better companies. Our RepTrak® model analyzes the reputations of companies and is best known as the Forbes-published Global RepTrak 100. Underlying the model is the RepTrak methodology, the global gold standard for measuring reputation. Learn more at: http://www.reputationinstitute.com.

The Akimbo Card is one of the first consumer prepaid cards to support Apple Pay.

“Being first-to-market with the latest payment innovations is a top priority for our prepaid card solutions, and we’re proud to launch Apple Pay support for our flagship consumer card brand Akimbo,” said Louis Hoch, President and CEO of FiCentive. “Our goal is to help businesses use the Akimbo platform to deliver a wide variety of payments from rewards and incentives to regular payroll. We’ve built one of the most unique consumer reloadable card programs in the market today and look forward to continuing to develop and grow our Akimbo platform.”
