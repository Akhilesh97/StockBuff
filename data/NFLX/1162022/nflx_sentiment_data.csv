With a GDP of $2.89 trillion and population of over 1.3 billion, India remains one of the biggest economies in the world with huge growth prospects. Despite the negative effects of the coronavirus crisis which caused the country’s economy to shrink by as much as 15%, India is set to surpass leading economies of the world over the next few years. According to a report by Deloitte, double-digit growth is expected for the Indian economy in 2022 based on the firm’s best-case scenario as the economy begins to come back to normal.

The report said that the top 10 income percentile of the Indian population is starting to spend more on elastic discretionary goods, which could rekindle growth of the private investment sector which had started to shrink following the coronavirus crisis. The report also added that the liquidity measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are also expected to boost the economy.

In January, a report by U.K.-based data analytics firm GlobalData estimated that the Indian economy is expected to grow at 9.7% in 2021, faster than all of the world’s major economies. The firm said this growth is backed by a massive increase in foreign direct investments, or FDI, Indian PM Narendra Modi’s $266 billion stimulus package and falling COVID-19 cases in the country.

Still a Lucrative Market

According to Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Indian economy shrank by 9.3% during 2020. However, analysts at the IMF have predicted that its growth rate will remain above 7% in 2021 which indicates that investors and corporations around the world would still find India a lucrative market to invest in.

""Although there are many heavyweights in India such as Reliance (NSE: RELIANCE) and Tata (NSE: TATAMOTORS), there is a huge emergence of successful and multi-billion-dollar startups. Most of the startups are concentrated in the e-commerce and software development sector. The latest figures put the Indian population at 1.366 billion. According to Columbia business school, the Indian middle class will grow to almost 583 million people or 41 percent of the total population. So, an increasing consumer market will lead to rapid growth in the shares of these companies' profits. That is why investment firms and corporations looking to invest in the growing economy of India should pay close attention to these companies.""

India, The Golden Bird

Right now, India has one of the most diverse and qualified workforce in the world. Corporations like IBM (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) hire thousands of Indians due to their acumen in management, technology, and financial subjects. Besides, many of these tech giants are being led by Indians such as Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella. India has emerged as an increasingly competitive market in the South Asian region. When Indian markets were de-regularized, it was thought that India would only be relying on multi-national corporations for fulfilling consumer demands. However, with the rise of e-commerce startups like Flipkart, Indian companies have now started to gain ground and become highly competitive as compared to their international counterparts.

Our Ranking Criteria For Top Emerging Companies in India

The list of new startups in a country on the verge of the social internet boom is a long one but we have devised the following strategy in order to rank these companies. It will serve as a guideline for potential investors and will offer a different perspective in making investments and informed decisions.

Employment growth

Employment growth is a measure of new employees entering the organization as well as indicating the growth in the size and scale of a company and its expansion.

Social Impact

Social impact is one of the major components for an emerging company’s success. Bringing in a new product, service or trend indicates a social impact. For example, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) created a huge social impact when the online streaming service introduced a new way of accessing content.

Funding & Investment

Many emerging companies and startups rely on seed funding as well as capital from investors and venture capitalists. It is also an important parameter to assess an emerging company’s future and profitability that can be gained in terms of ROI in the future.

Global Footprint

The last factor which determines any company or startup's potential is the level of its global footprint. Companies which operate exclusively in India are slightly disadvantaged. Although India has a massive consumer base, we believe a company needs to defy borders to scale and grow.

Let's start our list of top 15 emerging companies in India.

3,2021-03-01T13:00:12+00:00,"Netflix, Disney Win Big at a Golden Globes Suited for a Pandemic","(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. emerged as the big winners at the Golden Globe awards, taking home most of the evening’s prizes for their films and television shows, in an awards show tailor-made for the unusual pandemic-affected times.

Disney grabbed the top award, best dramatic motion picture, for “Nomadland,” while the film’s director Chloe Zhao became the second-ever woman to take home that prize. Netflix especially dominated in television, with “The Crown” and “The Queen’s Gambit,” grabbing a handful of awards at the ceremony. In all, the two studios won 15 of the prizes handed out Sunday by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in a NBC broadcast hosted by comic actors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

The dominance of the top global streaming service and the top traditional studio won’t surprise many. For the past year, many theaters have been closed, and the biggest new films have been delayed or put online. That also meant studios had to hold back at least some of their multimillion-dollar marketing budgets, making it harder to suss out clear favorites. Instead, online viewing was on the rise, with even Disney leaning hard into the change, expanding its Disney+ streaming service and debuting top films over the internet.

Netflix shares were up 1.1% to $544.50 and Disney was up 1.7% to $192.30 in premarket trading at 7:57 a.m. Monday in New York.

Other streaming services, particularly Amazon.com Inc., also picked up key prizes. “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” won best picture, musical or comedy, and its star Sacha Baron Cohen won the Golden Globe for his performance. Other winners included Daniel Kaluuya, who was named best supporting actor in a motion picture for his role in “Judas and the Black Messiah,” a Warner Bros. film about the FBI’s infiltration of the Black Panthers. John Boyega was voted best supporting actor in a TV role for his part in “Small Axe,” an Amazon show about London’s West Indian community, and “Schitt’s Creek” captured the award for best TV comedy.

Because of Covid-19, the 78th Golden Globes were held with presenters and winners appearing remotely, unlike past years, when the awards were handed out in a banquet room at the Beverly Hilton hotel before a TV audience of millions. They’re also usually held in January, when many awards contenders are still playing in theaters.

Read more: See the full list of winners here.

An opening monologue from comedians Fey and Poehler highlighted the oddity. Rather than sharing the stage at the Hilton, they spoke from separate stages there and at the Rainbow Room in New York.

“Normally this room is full of celebrities, but tonight our audience on both coasts is made of smoking-hot first responders,” Fey said. “We are so grateful for the work that you do, and that you’re here, so that the celebrities can stay safely at home.”

The picture has been much brighter for TV, which the Globes also celebrate. Millions of people stuck at home in the U.S. and abroad over the past year swarmed to streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, which now count hundreds of millions of subscribers globally.

In addition to winning best television drama, Netflix’s British royal chronicle “The Crown,” saw the actors who played Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Emma Corrin and Josh O’Connor, both take home acting awards. Gillian Anderson won a supporting Golden Globe for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the series.

With film nominees like “Mank” and popular series like “The Crown,” Netflix led the nominations with 42. Disney was second with 20, including a best-picture nod for the movie “Nomadland” and its star Frances McDormand.

The year’s awards also come against the backdrop of controversy surrounding the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group of journalists that chooses the nominees and winners.

Read more: Golden Globes promise to add Black members

A lawsuit filed by a Norwegian journalist who was denied membership accused the organization of corruption, laid out in a series of exposes by the Los Angeles Times. The suit was dismissed, but several members told the newspaper awards can effectively be “bought” with expensive press junkets, among other inappropriate behavior.

The group has also been criticized for failing to have a Black member for at least 20 years and for overlooking some of the buzziest Black-led pictures this year with their film-drama nominations. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and “Da 5 Bloods” are expected to be nominated for best picture at this year’s Academy Awards, according to the website Gold Derby. The Oscar nominations come out on March 15.

The HFPA told the newspaper that none of the allegations had been proven in court, and they reflected “unconscious bias” against its “diverse membership.”

Even with pandemic, the Golden Globes remain a big marketing showcase. Last year’s telecast drew a U.S. TV audience of 18.3 million viewers, putting it among the most-watched nonsports shows of the year. The Oscars, the movie industry’s most-prestigious awards, drew an audience of 24.3 million.

4,2021-02-28T22:55:27+00:00,"Looking Back On Pokemon's 25th Anniversary: Trading Cards, Video Games And Happy Meals","Over the weekend, Pokemon celebrated its 25th anniversary. The idea of “pocket monsters” has led the Japanese franchise into successful trading card games, video games, television shows, movies and licensing opportunities.

Pokemon-licensed items accounted for $4.2 billion in retail sales in 2019, according to data from License Global. That figure may have increased in 2020 and 2021 with new items and license partners jumping on board for the 25th anniversary.

The anniversary for Pokemon included a virtual concert with Post Malone and the unveiling of several new items from the company.

Here is a look back at the success of Pokemon and what’s to come.

Investing In Success of Pokemon: The Pokemon Company is jointly owned by video game companies Creatures, Game Freak and Nintendo Co (OTC: NTDOY).

Investors only have the option of stock from Nintendo Co., which owns around 33% of The Pokemon Company. Along with its ownership in the Pokemon company and brand, Nintendo benefits from being the exclusive home to Pokemon video games on the Nintendo Switch.

Trading Cards Rise In Popularity: One of the trends that happened with Pokemon in 2020 was investors flocking to old unopened boxes of Pokemon cards. Over the weekend, over 2.5 million people watched Logan Paul in partnership with Goldin Auctions for a box break on YouTube.

The box was valued at over $1 million with an auction of the unopened packs taking place before the unboxing. Two first edition Holo Charizard cards were opened in the box. This card is considered one of the holy grails in trading card gaming.

Wizards of the Coast, which is now owned by Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ: HAS), gained the rights to make Pokemon cards in the late 1990s. The company released the first Pokemon TCG cards in the U.S. in 1999. The cards sold over 400,000 units in the first six weeks, which was 10 times more than the company projected.

In 2003, Nintendo established an American division to make Pokemon TCG cards with Wizards of the Coast's contract ending. Wizards of the Coast sued Nintendo and reached a resolution out of court over releasing cards at the same time and luring executives away to the new card division.

In Japan, Pokemon TCG cards sold over 1 billion cards in their first three years.

Pokemon Video Games: Pokemon has been of the most popular video game franchises, dating back to the release of ""Pokemon Red"" and ""Pokemon Blue"" on the Game Boy.

It was announced last week that “Pokemon Brilliant Diamond” and “Pokemon Shining Pearl” will launch exclusively on the Nintendo Switch in late 2021. A third new Pokemon game called “Pokemon Legends: Arceus” will launch on the Switch in 2022.

The first two games are remakes of the iconic “Pokemon Diamond” and “Pokemon Pearl” games that were released on the Nintendo DS and sold over 17.7 million copies.

“Pokemon Sword” and “Pokemon Shield” sold over 20.35 million units on the Nintendo Switch as of December 31, making them the fifth bestselling games on the console.

Pokemon Go: In 2016, “Pokemon Go” became one of the most successful mobile phone game launches ever. The launch helped boost Nintendo shares and led to a surge in popularity for the brand again.

“Pokemon Go” had revenue of $832 million 2016. The following year, revenue dipped 29% to $589 million. The dip was short-lived though, as revenue for “Pokemon Go” has gone up every year since. In 2019, revenue for “Pokemon Go” was $902 million.

Last year, “Pokemon Go” had its best year ever with revenue of $1.92 billion, a year-over-year increase of 39%, according to data from Super Data.

McDonald’s Joins The Fun: One of the key partners with Pokemon for the 25h anniversary is McDonald’s Corp (NYSE: MCD). The restaurant chain is currently offering four card packs of Pokemon in its Happy Meals.

Fans have been buying as many Happy Meals as they can, leading to premiums for resellers listing the cards and unopened packs on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).

“With the significant demand for our promotional Pokemon TCG cards, and some fans even going to extreme lengths to get them, we’re working quickly to address shortages and also strongly encouraging restaurants to set a reasonable limit on Happy Melas sold per customer,” McDonald’s said in a statement to Polygon.

Pokemon Television And Movies: There are dozens of Pokemon movies and several television series, many which can be found by subscribers of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).

A new movie called “Detective Pikachu” was released in 2019 with Warner Brothers, an AT&T Inc (NYSE: T) company. The movie grossed $144.1 million domestically and $433 million worldwide. A sequel has been rumored but not confirmed by the parties involved.

Some investors may remember how the success of the original Pokemon television series boosted the value of 4Kids Entertainment, which traded on the NYSE. The company held the rights to license Pokemon outside of Asia.

Shares of 4Kids Entertainment went up 10-fold in price and had two stock splits. The company was valued at over $1 billion before declaring bankruptcy and being delisted.

5,2021-02-27T14:27:16+00:00,Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller’s Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article we take a look at billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks. The billionaire is making waves as he recently revealed that he is long Bitcoin and considers the cryptocurrency a valuable asset class. You can skip our detailed discussion of Druckenmiller's history, his hedge fund's performance and go to Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's Top 5 Stock Picks.

Stanley Freeman Druckenmiller is an American billionaire and hedge fund manager who founded Duquesne Capital in 1981. For 30 years the hedge fund posted excellent returns, but in 2010 the billionaire announced to shutter the fund citing “emotional toll” of not being able to come up to the high expectations of investors. At the time of closing, the hedge fund had $12 billion in managed securities. Druckenmiller’s hedge fund had posted average gains of 30% over two decades of its operations before it closed, an excellent record when compared to peers. In 2008, when most hedge funds suffered heavy losses and declined 19% on average, Duquesne returned 11%.

Duquesne Capital is now a family office.

The 67-year-old billionaire whose net worth stands at $4.4 billion today worked for legendary investor George Soros until 2000. The duo made a fortune when their bets against the British pound paid off on the famous “Black Wednesday” of 1992. Soros gave control of his hedge fund to Druckenmiller in 1989 to focus on philanthropy.

From Hot Dog Stand to Billions

Born in Pennsylvania, Druckenmiller graduated from Collegiate School, Virginia. In 1975, while doing his bachelor’s in English and Economics from Bowdoin College, Druckenmiller started a hot dog stand with Lawrence B. Lindsey, who later became economic policy adviser to President George W. Bush.

Druckenmiller's investment philosophy gives importance to macroeconomic factors that control the current market environment. Druckenmiller invests in both short and long positions and uses leverage to trade currency and futures.

A ""Raging Mania""

During an interview with CNBC a few months back, the investor talked about the current market situation.

""The stock market is in a mania fueled by the Federal Reserve and investor speculation that will end badly in the coming years.""

Here is what Stanley Druckenmiller stated:

""I think the merging of the Fed and the Treasury which is what's happening during Covid -- is obviously creating a massive ranging mania in financial assets. Everybody loves a party. I love a party. I assume you guys love a party, but inevitably after a big party, there's a hangover. Right now, we're on an absolute-ranging mania. We've got commentators on different networks encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40%, big market companies on stock splits. That creates no value, but the stocks still go up. I have no clue where the market's gonna go in the near term. I don't know when it's going to go up 10%, I don't know when it's going to go down 10%. I just want to remind people that there is no valuation support just because we dropped 10%. That does not matter because we are so far outside the valuation realm with the Fed doing what they're doing, that does not matter. But I would say that the next 3-5 years is going to be very very challenging.""

Druckenmiller Is Long Bitcoin

Druckenmiller recently revealed that he owns Bitcoin. The billionaire said that Bitcoin has a lot of inherent value and it’s gaining traction and stability with each passing day.

Frankly, if the gold bet works, the Bitcoin bet will probably work better because it’s thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it.

Druckermiller's Latest Moves

During the fourth quarter Stan Druckenmiller sold all of his position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), while increasing hold in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE: PANW) by 457%. The fund currently holds $335 million worth of PANW shares, making it Duquesne's 6th biggest holding.

Druckenmiller also trimmed around a fifth of his Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) and Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ: PENN) positions, while dumping his entire stake in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). Duquesne Capital also sold its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) in the fourth quarter of 2020. Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's Top 10 Stock Picks

Druckenmiller isn't the only one who struggled with his returns. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Before we start taking a look at Druckenmiller’s family office's top stock picks, here’s a an ironic remark the billionaire once made about the soaring tech stock prices during a meeting at Soros Fund Management, as reported by the WSJ in 2000.

""I don't like this market. I think we should probably lighten up. I don't want to go out like Steinhardt.""

He was referring to Michael Steinhardt, who closed his hedge fund 1995 after suffering heavy losses.

Let's start our list of Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks.

10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS)

Value: $123,988,000Change in Position Size: 378%Percent of Stan Druckenmiller's 13F Portfolio: 3.3%

Walt Disney ranks 10th on our list of Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks. The California-based mass media company aims to be one of the world's leading producers and providers of entertainment and information. Recently, The Walt Disney was able to clinch the 4th spot on Fortune's 2021 list of the ""World's Most Admired Companies,"" despite losing billions of dollars amid the coronavirus crisis. With a current market capitalization worth $358.5 billion, Walt Disney delivered a 60% return in the past 12 months.

According to our database, the number of Walt Disney’s long hedge funds positions increased at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. There were 144 hedge funds that hold a position in Disney by the end of December, compared to the 112 funds in the third quarter. The biggest stakeholder of the company is Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, with 11 million shares, worth $2 billion.

Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, said that they acquired a position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), and believes that there’s still a wide room for growth in the company. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their investor letter:

""Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

9. Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN)

Value: $128,369,000Change in Position Size: 0%Percent of Stan Druckenmiller's 13F Portfolio: 3.5%

""Penn National operates 40 properties (casinos and racetracks) across 20 states. In February. Penn National purchased a 36% interest in Barstool Sports, an online sports media company with 66 million monthly active users. Penn National is using Barstool Sports as the brand of its digital strategy and retains 100% of the sports betting and online casino (iGaming) proceeds in the relationship. Traditional brick¬and-mortar casino gambling in the U.S. is not a growth industry: however, two unique growth areas exist for casino operators: online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming. More states are considering legalization of OSB and iGaming due to Covid¬19-related budget shortfalls, as gambling can raise substantial tax revenue. Importantly, data shows that sports betting and online casinos do not cannibalize brick-and-mortar casino revenues. Additionally, gaming companies must have a physical presence within the states where they seek to have online gambling and sports betting legalized, so Penn National’s brick-and-mortar facilities give the company an advantage in this area. Shares of Penn National performed strongly during the third quarter in response to the company’s brick-and-mortar properties recently generating higher margins compared to pre-Covid-19 levels. a result of the company cutting costs and increased customer spending. Investors also responded favorably to Barstool’s September launch of its Sportsbook app in Pennsylvania. Additionally. sports betting and online gaming levels have reached record highs in numerous states.” Penn National Gaming, Inc (PENN)

6,2021-02-26T19:39:13+00:00,3 Short-Squeeze Stocks for Long-Term Bullish Profits,"“They’re back!!” Well kinda, sorta. I’m referring to this week’s rematch pitting David versus Goliath in some of the market’s most heavily shorted stocks. But for investors interested in the next big thing and short-squeeze stocks sporting more sustainable staying power, the following three names are offering attractive opportunities off and on the price chart.

A short-squeeze stock media circus has cooled. And the nightly news is back dutifully covering how Main Street is faring beyond Wall Street as we pass the one-year milestone of living with the novel coronavirus. But “Gamestonk!!” or rather GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and a few others have had their short-squeeze playbooks dusted off this week by that rogue band of merry retail traders from Robinhood and Reddit’s WallStreetBets for a second round of over-the-top crusading.

How the price action will turn out on any given day is anyone’s guess. But there’s little doubt bears in short-squeeze stocks will make hay, if they get out alive, in many of those names they have in their crosshairs. The fact is more than a few of those heavily shorted companies’ prospects are grim at best. Still, those market pros are far from perfect.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It’s also true those typically larger and sophisticated bearish operatives have been wrong before and forced to permanently concede their position. And in some instances, once heavily shorted, short-squeeze stocks have turned into long-term and even phenomenal winners for bullish investors. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are prime examples. More recently, last year’s incredible 700% rally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cost those traders more than $39 billion in 2020. Silly bears.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

The trio of short-squeeze opportunities for investors:

iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) fuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)

Given history can repeat and with an eye on the next big market disrupting business, let’s dive into three of today’s short-squeeze stocks the so-called smart money may also have completely wrong in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

Short-Squeeze Stocks to Buy: iRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) weekly cup with irregular high handle

The first of our short-squeeze stocks to buy is iRobot. Earlier this month, the maker of the Roomba and Braava robot cleaning devices easily topped Street views and delivered double-digit profit and sales growth for the company’s fourth quarter. The outfit also hiked its full-year 2021 guidance well-above consensus forecasts.

iRobot currently maintains short interest of 23%. And this short-squeeze stock did see an explosion in its share price during late January’s brief coup by investors riding the coattails of GME stock. Today, conditions have quieted and that’s looking increasingly good for IRBT stock investors.

On the weekly price chart, January’s cup-shaped breakout has since found IRBT shares retreating into Fibonacci zone support modestly beneath the pattern high. Axing out January’s over-the-top short squeeze stock reaction and combined with solid fundamentals, what we’re left with is a bullish ‘high handle’ that looks good for cleaning up tomorrow.

The next of our short-squeeze stocks to buy is FuboTV. Amid Covid-19’s various restrictions the company’s streaming live sports platform has become an essential service for many individuals. Bullish preliminary guidance issued in late January looks to back up FuboTV’s popularity. Next week, investors will have the chance to see what that actually looks like when FUBO reports earnings on Tuesday.

Earnings reactions can be crapshoot. At the end of the day, it’s not just about a couple numbers. As well, for better or worse, sentiment can prove a much more meaningful motivator in the short term. Longer term, though, and with FuboTV also moving to integrate sports betting into its platform later this year, a slam dunk for shareholders that stay the course makes this short-squeeze stock an even better wager.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Technically, FUBO stock is in a testing position of an uptrend line backed by two layers of Fibonacci support. In our estimation, it’s a nice enough spot for investors to pick up this short-squeeze stock at an attractive discount and in front of a third potential and maybe much longer-lasting knockout to bears.

Beyond Meat (BYND) Beyond Meat (BYND) testing channel support

The last of our short-squeeze stocks to buy is Beyond Meat. Since coming public in 2019, the faux meat upstart has maintained its share of skeptical shorts. Today the count stands at 23% of BYND’s float. Last night, those bears were looking to take a bite out of the stock after the company reported a wider-than-forecast quarterly loss. Instead, the meal turned into a quick and smaller snack.

Deals also announced after Thursday’s closing bell which have Beyond Meat working with fast-food giants McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum Brands! (NYSE:YUM) rightfully stole the show, as well as the bears’ ammo. And in Friday’s session shares have firmly reversed the after-hours weakness and added about 3.50% in finger-licking-good activity.

Technically, shares are in a testing position of key Fibonacci levels tied to key lows from March 2020 and January. The decline from this short-squeeze stock’s January price spike has also challenged BYND’s lifetime 50% level, while maintaining the integrity of a bullish up-channel that’s formed over the past year. It’s bullish, but I’ll concede this one still needs to be cooked a bit longer before buying shares.

7,2021-02-26T17:55:52+00:00,Google’s Stadia Problem? A Video Game Unit That’s Not Googley Enough,"(Bloomberg) -- Google’s streaming video game service Stadia had ambitious plans to disrupt the gaming industry, which is dominated by consoles. The tech giant had planned to pack Stadia with original content, announcing two years ago that it was hiring hundreds of game developers and starting studios in Los Angeles and Montreal.

But those teams barely had time to get started before they were dismissed earlier this month as Google shut down in-house game development.

From the beginning, Google’s approach to video games wasn’t very Google-like. The Alphabet Inc. company tends to launch bare-bones products and test them as they grow. With Stadia, it came out big. Flashy press conferences and ad campaigns promised high-quality games with innovative features playable on Android smartphones or on the TV through Chromecast. Gamers would have access to a library of exclusive titles and well-known favorites like Assassin’s Creed without having to dish out $500 for Sony Corp.’s PlayStation or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

So when Stadia launched in 2019, gamers were expecting the complete package, not the beta model. While the cloud streaming technology was there, playing to Google’s strengths, the library of games was underwhelming and many of the promised features nonexistent. Other platforms offer hundreds of games a year, but Stadia offers fewer than 80, according to Mat Piscatella, an analyst at the NPD Group, which tracks video game sales data.

Players also didn’t like Stadia’s business model, which required customers to buy games individually rather than subscribe to an all-you-can-play service à la Netflix or the Xbox’s Game Pass. Paying as much as $60 for a single game, for it only to exist on Google’s servers rather than on your own PC, seemed a stretch to some. After all the hype, gamers were disappointed. Stadia missed its targets for sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Story continues

“I think it would be fair to say the messaging leading up to and around the launch was inconsistent,” with the final product, Piscatella says.

Stadia’s struggles are a warning sign for other prospective video game streaming services. Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc., both deep-pocketed major technology companies with experience in video games, have ambitions in the area with their respective xCloud and Luna offerings. But those products have rolled out gradually, rather than promising to be console-killers, keeping expectations in check.

It didn’t have to be this way. Google actually had a beta version of Stadia in 2018. Called Project Stream, it allowed users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s popular game Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the tab of a Chrome browser. Fans were impressed.

The following year, at the Game Developers Conference, Phil Harrison, who is in charge of Stadia, unveiled what he called the “future of gaming.” He promised that Stadia would be more powerful than PlayStation or Xbox. He showed off innovative features like State Share, which would allow users to take snapshots of their games and share them with friends, allowing those friends to jump into the same game exactly where they had left off.

The prospects were exciting to fans and pundits, who predicted that Stadia could dominate the market, offering many of the same games as Xbox and PlayStation without the hefty price tag.

But all the buildup had some developers within Stadia worried, according to people familiar with the matter. Their deadline to ship the platform in the fall of 2019 wouldn’t allow them to deliver what players expected, they said. They argued that Google should position the launch as another beta test. After all, Google’s most successful products had followed a similar approach. Gmail was officially in beta testing for five years, for example, as the company continued to tweak and refine it.

There was resistance from Harrison and others on the Stadia leadership team, many of whom had come from the world of traditional console development and wanted to follow the route they knew.

Harrison had positioned Stadia as a traditional gaming platform full of bells and whistles, but that didn’t mesh with Google’s own mantra to “think big but start small,” as detailed in a 2011 blog post by longtime Google executive Susan Wojcicki, now chief executive officer of YouTube. “Watching users ‘in the wild’ as they use our products is the best way to find out what works, then we can act on that feedback,” she wrote. “It’s much better to learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far down the wrong path.”

A British video game industry veteran, Harrison was a prominent face at both PlayStation and Xbox during their worst console launches — the overpriced PlayStation 3 and badly managed Xbox One. He joined Google in 2018 as vice president of Stadia.

His team wooed big-name publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., shelling out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption II on Stadia, according to two people familiar with the deals. The amount of money Google was willing to spend came as a shock to veteran game developers, but even that wasn’t enough. Video game platforms live or die on exclusive content. So Harrison also brought in Jade Raymond, a veteran executive who has worked on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars, to start building an in-house development division.

When Stadia officially released on Nov. 19, 2019, it left critics scratching their heads. The library of games was small and mostly old, with none of Google’s exclusives available yet. Most of the features Harrison promised were not actually there, such as the State Share concept. The platform was only available through a $130 kit that included a special controller and Chromecast. Gaming website Kotaku called the marketing “random and terrible” and the platform failed to catch on. In fact, the company produced so many more Stadia controllers than it had demand for, that last year it gave them away for free.

Despite the tepid launch, there was optimism among Stadia’s developers that they could win over fans with exclusive games, so long as Google gave them time to thrive. They were excited about game prototypes that could only work on a cloud platform, pushing memory limits with computer-driven artificial intelligence. One prototype, according to people familiar with the plans, was described as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet, allowing players to interact with smart creatures in all sorts of fun ways.

Then on Feb. 1, Google suddenly pulled the plug on in-house development. Stadia will still exist as a service and continue to offer third-party games that are also available on other platforms. But without exclusives, Stadia has little hope of competing with big consoles or building an audience of millions. It seems unlikely to be the “future of gaming” that Harrison had promised.

While Stadia didn’t seem to follow the traditional Google playbook, without some drastic changes it could still face a pretty Googley outcome: being added to the long list of products that Google has killed.

8,2021-02-26T15:38:06+00:00,How to Navigate the Questionable Future of the Top 10 Meme Stocks,"Meme stocks took over the market in late January, and in recent days they’ve rallied again.

In most cases, and maybe all, the rallies have gone simply too far. We’ve seen some meme stocks gain over 1,000%. Others have reached obviously unsustainable valuations.

But at the same time, there are fundamental underpinnings to the case for many of the hottest “Reddit stocks.” These aren’t shell companies, or straight pump-and-dumps. Investors are buying real businesses with real potential.

7 Cheap Stocks to Buy for March

Obviously, those investors need to pay the right price for that potential, and that’s the big problem at the moment. But as the dust settles, there may be opportunities. And so it’s worth looking at the long-term outlook for 10 of the most popular meme stocks:

GameStop (NYSE:GME) AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Express (NYSE:EXPR) Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) Bed, Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Zomedica (NYSEAMERICAN:ZOM) BlackBerry (NYSE:BB)

For all the hype over the $483 peak and r/WallStreetBets and the supposed “short squeeze” (which probably was actually a “gamma squeeze”), it’s important to remember what caused GME stock to start moving last year: solid fundamental analysis.

The early GME bulls certainly saw the heavy short interest as a potential catalyst for the stock. But they also argued that the market was mispricing the stock for two core reasons.

First, they believed the market was interpreting GameStop’s plunging profits as a sign of the end of GameStop. In fact, bulls argued, they were a sign of the end of the console cycle. With new consoles coming from Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), earnings would quickly rebound in 2021 and beyond.

Second, there was room for GameStop to pivot to digital and e-commerce. The arrival of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen only added to this part of the case.

Story continues

That bull case was valid. It still is — at the right price. With GME stock soaring again on Wednesday, and giving GameStop a market capitalization over $6 billion, the price isn’t right yet. But once the dust inevitably settles, it may be again.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) Image of the entrance of an AMC Entertainment (AMC) branded theater. undervalued stocks

For AMC Entertainment, however, the bull case is tougher to make. That’s true even though AMC, unlike GameStop, managed to use its epic rally to fix up its balance sheet.

AMC did see lender Silver Lake convert $600 million in debt into AMC stock, which will lower debt and interest expense going forward. It raised another $300 million at roughly $5 per share in two days in late January. That was on top of $917 million in cash added between Dec. 14 and Jan. 25.

That’s all well and good, and AMC has created some breathing room. But it’s not as if AMC fixed its balance sheet. The company closed the third quarter with nearly $6 billion in debt. Even adjusting for cash held then, the Silver Lake conversion, and the capital raised since, borrowings remain above $4 billion.

Meanwhile, AMC’s share count has ballooned from under 140 million shares to 356 million shares at the moment.

At $9, then, incredibly AMC has a market capitalization near $3 billion. At the beginning of 2020, before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit, AMC was worth less than $1 billion. In fact, even with the balance sheet moves, AMC now has a higher enterprise value (market capitalization plus net debt) than it did at the beginning of 2020.

It’s hard to see how that makes sense. The pressures on the movie theater business were extant long before the pandemic shuttered theaters. The rise of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services is one factor. Consumer spending on better home systems during the pandemic likely hasn’t helped.

This still looks like a company with a significant risk of going bankrupt. It certainly doesn’t look like a company that merits an enterprise value of some $8 billion.

I’ve been bearish on NOK stock for years now. Even with the stock having round-tripped following a brief late January spike, I’m bearish still.

To be fair, there is a bull case here. Relative to earnings, NOK remains cheap. The opportunity in 5G is real.

Yet there’s been a bull case for years now. Nokia simply has failed to execute. Bear in mind that Nokia was on the winning side of one of the most lopsided deals in history: the $7.2 billion sale of its handset business to Microsoft. Microsoft dumped the business two years later for just $350 million.

That windfall didn’t help NOK stock. The merger with Lucent-Alcatel didn’t help. 5G hasn’t yet done anything, either.

Perhaps this time will be different. But that seems like a questionable bet, even with NOK back at $4. Meanwhile, Reddit missed the far more attractive opportunity: rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), which trades at a similar valuation with better performance and market share growth.

Express (EXPR) the storefront of an Express store in a mall

The group of meme stocks has some odd choices, and Express is one of them. Investors looking for struggling mall retailers had (and have) plenty of options. EXPR’s short interest wasn’t even particularly high.

All that aside, there was a reason Express stock was trading below $1 at the beginning of the year: the company is in trouble. Even in fiscal 2019 (ending Feb. 1, 2020), Express was unprofitable. Same-store sales were heading in the wrong direction, including a 6% decline in the retail business.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Before the Reddit-driven rally, the Express turnaround seemed like it had little chance of succeeding. Rather, the brand seemed destined to join so many other mall-based retailers that wound up in bankruptcy. Other than EXPR gaining 257% year-to-date, it doesn’t appear that all that much has changed.

KOSS might be the strangest of all the meme stocks. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with Koss. It’s just difficult to see what sparked any optimism toward the stock, let alone enough to send it up 3,600% in a matter of weeks. This doesn’t even appear to have been a short squeeze: short interest at Jan. 15 was a little over 12,000 shares.

To be fair, Koss is a relatively interesting company. Its core claim to fame is that it invented stereo headphones, back in the late 1950s. And before the January rally — and a curious one-day frenzy in late December — KOSS stock had rallied nicely from March lows.

All that said, this really is just a sleepy nano-cap stock. Koss’s twelve-month revenue is $18.9 million. Net income over that stretch is just $700,000.

And yet KOSS stock now trades at nearly 200x those net earnings. There’s seemingly no justification for that multiple. When and if KOSS returns to being a sleepy nano-cap, there might be an intriguing case. Until then, the stock is an easy one to avoid.

Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY) bed bath & beyond storefront (BBBY)

BBBY is one of the meme stocks that had a real “short squeeze” case. At Jan. 15, short interest was some 74 million shares — about 60% of the outstanding total. Even with covering since, about 28% of shares are sold short at the moment.

BBBY is also a name where both bulls and bears can make reasonable arguments. Bears saw a declining brick-and-mortar retailer with a leveraged balance sheet — an absolutely brutal combination even before the pandemic. Indeed, BBBY entered last year below $20 after touching nearly $80 in early 2015.

But bulls saw the case for a turnaround under new management. Concepts beyond the namesake brand, including buybuyBABY, have real value and the potential for a GameStop-like pivot to digital.

7 Stocks That Will Skyrocket With Government Stimulus

Simply put, BBBY was a battleground stock before it joined the rank of meme stocks. And although the stock is up 54% year-to-date, given the balance sheet leverage, that move doesn’t significantly alter the case. Bulls and bears likely see the name the same way now as they did two months ago.

Sundial Growers (SNDL) marijuana stocks Hand gently holding rich soil for his marijuana plants

I detailed the long-term case for SNDL stock back in December. Heading into 2020, Sundial appeared at significant risk of bankruptcy. A series of moves strengthened the balance sheet and positioned Sundial Growers for a possible turnaround.

By late January, it was already clear that the company was becoming more aggressive. And then the craziness started.

SNDL stock closed on Jan. 26 at 56 cents after a six-session losing streak. Over the next 11 trading days, it rallied a stunning 427%.

Even with a recent bounce, shares have shed more than half their value from the peak. There’s probably more downside ahead. The story can work long-term, and the opportunity for Canadian cannabis companies like Sundial remains attractive. Yet competition is stiff, growth has disappointed, and Sundial still has an awful lot of work to do.

A market capitalization over $2 billion doesn’t seem to properly account for those challenges. But like so many meme stocks, SNDL could be attractive again — when and if its stock price returns to Earth.

Investors cheered when Tilray and Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) announced an all-stock merger in December. Tilray stock rallied 18.6% on the news.

The optimism makes some sense. The Canadian cannabis industry still is trying to shrink its production capacity, debt and, most importantly, costs. The merger should help the combined company accelerate progress on all three fronts. It creates a legitimate rival to Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), both of which are backed by massive war chests.

But at this point, there’s no reason to play that merger via TLRY stock. Aphria shareholders are receiving 0.8381 Tilray shares for each share they own. TLRY closed Wednesday at $27.98, which in turn suggests that a share of Aphria stock should trade at $23.45.

APHA, instead, is barely above $20. So the math is simple and so is it lesson: investors who want to own the combined company after the merger closes should own APHA, not TLRY, before the merger closes.

The problem for ZOM stock isn’t just the massive rally: the stock is up over 3,000% from last year’s lows. The problem is that the story many bulls are telling doesn’t quite match with the reality of the business.

The pitch for ZOM is that the company is set for potentially exponential growth. Its Truforma diagnostic platform is set to launch. Truforma offers diagnostic assays that can test companion animals for thyroid and kidney diseases — with the results available in-office.

Essentially, Truforma is a veterinary version of what disgraced start-upTheranos promised. Only Truforma is, well, real.

But Truforma also serves a dramatically smaller customer base. Zomedica itself has said that the entire diagnostic market for companion animals should be less than $3 billion in 2024. Truforma is targeting only a small slice of that market, yet it is now valued at some $1.8 billion (including the significant number of warrants outstanding).

Truforma is likely to drive some growth. It’s unlikely to drive enough growth.

BlackBerry, the former leader in smartphones, is trying to reinvent itself — again. This time around, BlackBerry is trying to use its expertise in security to build out a cybersecurity platform.

It’s an intriguing case, albeit one that will take faith and patience. BlackBerry exited its hardware business back in September 2016. From that point to the beginning of this year, BB stock had posted negative returns amid a roaring broader market.

So this at the least seems like a “show me” story. Yet BB’s membership in the club of meme stocks seemingly prices in some level of success. Given how long it has been since BlackBerry has been even relevant, let alone successful, the rally seems too early. Patience seems advised, in terms of both the company’s results and the BB stock price.

9,2021-02-26T15:38:06+00:00,How to Navigate the Questionable Future of the Top 10 Meme Stocks,"Meme stocks took over the market in late January, and in recent days they’ve rallied again.

In most cases, and maybe all, the rallies have gone simply too far. We’ve seen some meme stocks gain over 1,000%. Others have reached obviously unsustainable valuations.

But at the same time, there are fundamental underpinnings to the case for many of the hottest “Reddit stocks.” These aren’t shell companies, or straight pump-and-dumps. Investors are buying real businesses with real potential.

7 Cheap Stocks to Buy for March

Obviously, those investors need to pay the right price for that potential, and that’s the big problem at the moment. But as the dust settles, there may be opportunities. And so it’s worth looking at the long-term outlook for 10 of the most popular meme stocks:

GameStop (NYSE:GME) AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Express (NYSE:EXPR) Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) Bed, Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Zomedica (NYSEAMERICAN:ZOM) BlackBerry (NYSE:BB)

Meme Stocks for the Long Term: GameStop (GME) GameStop video game and electronics store logo sign in Bay Terrace, Queens, NY.

For all the hype over the $483 peak and r/WallStreetBets and the supposed “short squeeze” (which probably was actually a “gamma squeeze”), it’s important to remember what caused GME stock to start moving last year: solid fundamental analysis.

The early GME bulls certainly saw the heavy short interest as a potential catalyst for the stock. But they also argued that the market was mispricing the stock for two core reasons.

First, they believed the market was interpreting GameStop’s plunging profits as a sign of the end of GameStop. In fact, bulls argued, they were a sign of the end of the console cycle. With new consoles coming from Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), earnings would quickly rebound in 2021 and beyond.

Second, there was room for GameStop to pivot to digital and e-commerce. The arrival of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen only added to this part of the case.

Story continues

That bull case was valid. It still is — at the right price. With GME stock soaring again on Wednesday, and giving GameStop a market capitalization over $6 billion, the price isn’t right yet. But once the dust inevitably settles, it may be again.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) Image of the entrance of an AMC Entertainment (AMC) branded theater. undervalued stocks

For AMC Entertainment, however, the bull case is tougher to make. That’s true even though AMC, unlike GameStop, managed to use its epic rally to fix up its balance sheet.

AMC did see lender Silver Lake convert $600 million in debt into AMC stock, which will lower debt and interest expense going forward. It raised another $300 million at roughly $5 per share in two days in late January. That was on top of $917 million in cash added between Dec. 14 and Jan. 25.

That’s all well and good, and AMC has created some breathing room. But it’s not as if AMC fixed its balance sheet. The company closed the third quarter with nearly $6 billion in debt. Even adjusting for cash held then, the Silver Lake conversion, and the capital raised since, borrowings remain above $4 billion.

Meanwhile, AMC’s share count has ballooned from under 140 million shares to 356 million shares at the moment.

At $9, then, incredibly AMC has a market capitalization near $3 billion. At the beginning of 2020, before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit, AMC was worth less than $1 billion. In fact, even with the balance sheet moves, AMC now has a higher enterprise value (market capitalization plus net debt) than it did at the beginning of 2020.

It’s hard to see how that makes sense. The pressures on the movie theater business were extant long before the pandemic shuttered theaters. The rise of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services is one factor. Consumer spending on better home systems during the pandemic likely hasn’t helped.

This still looks like a company with a significant risk of going bankrupt. It certainly doesn’t look like a company that merits an enterprise value of some $8 billion.

I’ve been bearish on NOK stock for years now. Even with the stock having round-tripped following a brief late January spike, I’m bearish still.

To be fair, there is a bull case here. Relative to earnings, NOK remains cheap. The opportunity in 5G is real.

Yet there’s been a bull case for years now. Nokia simply has failed to execute. Bear in mind that Nokia was on the winning side of one of the most lopsided deals in history: the $7.2 billion sale of its handset business to Microsoft. Microsoft dumped the business two years later for just $350 million.

That windfall didn’t help NOK stock. The merger with Lucent-Alcatel didn’t help. 5G hasn’t yet done anything, either.

Perhaps this time will be different. But that seems like a questionable bet, even with NOK back at $4. Meanwhile, Reddit missed the far more attractive opportunity: rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), which trades at a similar valuation with better performance and market share growth.

Express (EXPR) the storefront of an Express store in a mall

The group of meme stocks has some odd choices, and Express is one of them. Investors looking for struggling mall retailers had (and have) plenty of options. EXPR’s short interest wasn’t even particularly high.

All that aside, there was a reason Express stock was trading below $1 at the beginning of the year: the company is in trouble. Even in fiscal 2019 (ending Feb. 1, 2020), Express was unprofitable. Same-store sales were heading in the wrong direction, including a 6% decline in the retail business.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Before the Reddit-driven rally, the Express turnaround seemed like it had little chance of succeeding. Rather, the brand seemed destined to join so many other mall-based retailers that wound up in bankruptcy. Other than EXPR gaining 257% year-to-date, it doesn’t appear that all that much has changed.

Koss (KOSS) A Koss (KOSS) Porta Pro headset in a box.

KOSS might be the strangest of all the meme stocks. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with Koss. It’s just difficult to see what sparked any optimism toward the stock, let alone enough to send it up 3,600% in a matter of weeks. This doesn’t even appear to have been a short squeeze: short interest at Jan. 15 was a little over 12,000 shares.

To be fair, Koss is a relatively interesting company. Its core claim to fame is that it invented stereo headphones, back in the late 1950s. And before the January rally — and a curious one-day frenzy in late December — KOSS stock had rallied nicely from March lows.

All that said, this really is just a sleepy nano-cap stock. Koss’s twelve-month revenue is $18.9 million. Net income over that stretch is just $700,000.

And yet KOSS stock now trades at nearly 200x those net earnings. There’s seemingly no justification for that multiple. When and if KOSS returns to being a sleepy nano-cap, there might be an intriguing case. Until then, the stock is an easy one to avoid.

Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY) bed bath & beyond storefront (BBBY)

BBBY is one of the meme stocks that had a real “short squeeze” case. At Jan. 15, short interest was some 74 million shares — about 60% of the outstanding total. Even with covering since, about 28% of shares are sold short at the moment.

BBBY is also a name where both bulls and bears can make reasonable arguments. Bears saw a declining brick-and-mortar retailer with a leveraged balance sheet — an absolutely brutal combination even before the pandemic. Indeed, BBBY entered last year below $20 after touching nearly $80 in early 2015.

But bulls saw the case for a turnaround under new management. Concepts beyond the namesake brand, including buybuyBABY, have real value and the potential for a GameStop-like pivot to digital.

7 Stocks That Will Skyrocket With Government Stimulus

Simply put, BBBY was a battleground stock before it joined the rank of meme stocks. And although the stock is up 54% year-to-date, given the balance sheet leverage, that move doesn’t significantly alter the case. Bulls and bears likely see the name the same way now as they did two months ago.

Sundial Growers (SNDL) marijuana stocks Hand gently holding rich soil for his marijuana plants

I detailed the long-term case for SNDL stock back in December. Heading into 2020, Sundial appeared at significant risk of bankruptcy. A series of moves strengthened the balance sheet and positioned Sundial Growers for a possible turnaround.

By late January, it was already clear that the company was becoming more aggressive. And then the craziness started.

SNDL stock closed on Jan. 26 at 56 cents after a six-session losing streak. Over the next 11 trading days, it rallied a stunning 427%.

Even with a recent bounce, shares have shed more than half their value from the peak. There’s probably more downside ahead. The story can work long-term, and the opportunity for Canadian cannabis companies like Sundial remains attractive. Yet competition is stiff, growth has disappointed, and Sundial still has an awful lot of work to do.

A market capitalization over $2 billion doesn’t seem to properly account for those challenges. But like so many meme stocks, SNDL could be attractive again — when and if its stock price returns to Earth.

Video Transcript

- What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world. And the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called Figs, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the health care sector is and the workers there on the frontline each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth, who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

- Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh, my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure. And Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman, was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group. Certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing hopefully some business acumen, and then the tech side. But it just allows us a lot of flexibility. We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that, and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

- Right. So I can see that it's not private equity per se or venture, anything like that. Permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life. And there was a moment-- I don't think he'd might be sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about it. And he stopped me and he goes, I got to be honest.

For years, Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here? And I kind of laughed, and he said, no, I'm dead serious. We always ask-- we don't want to be in the clever pile-- what can we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it?

14,2021-02-25T14:19:16+00:00,Blockbuster movies will come back after COVID-19: former Legendary Entertainment CEO,"U.S. box office revenue dropped 80% last year, a Comscore report found last month, hitting a 40-year low and reinforcing industry concerns that hit films may not return after the explosion of streaming amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

But in a recent interview, Thomas Tull — a billionaire former film producer behind blockbuster movies like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World"" — said hit movies would remain after the pandemic, even if they're increasingly watched in the home rather than the movie theater.

Top filmmakers will continue to make movies seen around the world, Tull said, but he acknowledged that the prevalence of streaming services will change how the industry monetizes films since they use ""completely different metrics.""

When asked whether blockbuster movies have become a thing of the past, Tull says, ""I don't think so.""

""I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than the imagination,"" says Tull, the former CEO of film production company Legendary Entertainment, who now runs a holding company called Tulco. ""Everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.""

""I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment,"" he adds. ""It was kind of surreal.""

COVID-19 has ""accelerated what was already happening,"" further sidelining the movie theater segment of the business and hastening the rise of streaming services, Tull said.

AT&T-owned WarnerMedia (T) sent shockwaves through the movie industry in December when it announced that it would release 2021 Warner Bros. movies simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming service when they hit movie theaters. The move began with ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" a highly anticipated action movie released on Dec. 25 starring Gal Gadot; it will continue with major upcoming movies such as ""Dune"" and ""Matrix 4.""

The WarnerMedia decision drew backlash from prominent filmmakers, including Christopher Nolan, who called the situation ""very, very, very, very messy."" Last week, director Martin Scorsese added his voice to the chorus critical of the rise of streaming, saying in an essay for Harper's Magazine that the platforms worsen the quality of film because their algorithms prize consumer appeal over taste.

Tull, who worked with Nolan on ""Batman Begins"" and other films, said top filmmakers will continue to create captivating work, no matter how it reaches audiences.

""Besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg — all these incredible storytellers,"" Tull says. ""I think at the heart of this, that it's part of our cultural fabric.""

""We're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront,"" he adds. ""It's just going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently."" Thomas Tull, the CEO of the holding company Tulco, speaks with Andy Serwer on an episode of ""Influencers with Andy Serwer.""

Tull spoke to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.

Since 2017, Tull has led Tulco, a holding company that helps businesses in various sectors improve through the deployment of artificial intelligence and other technical advances. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of the film production company Legendary Entertainment.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance, Tull said that the rise of streaming services allows for greater flexibility in visual storytelling.

""The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is it used to be something was a two-ish hour movie, or a 13-episode series on television and some small variations,"" he says.

""Now, you can do almost anything,"" he adds. ""The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes.""

15,2021-02-25T13:13:37+00:00,"Facebook, Netflix Face Fresh Scrutiny as India Tightens Grip","(Bloomberg) -- India joined the global regulatory push to rein in Silicon Valley technology giants, tightening rules that govern how social media and streaming companies do business in the world’s biggest democracy.

The new rules that come into immediate effect will require the likes of Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. to take down unlawful content quicker, Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in an online briefing Thursday. Messaging apps can be asked to provide the identity of the originators of unlawful messages on their platforms, Prasad said, implying the likes of Whatsapp may have to break the encryption and dilute users’ privacy safeguards.

Streaming services such as Netflix Inc., Google’s YouTube and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video face stricter oversight over content containing sexually explicit scenes, violence and abusive language, according to the new rules.

Already under scrutiny from Australia and Europe to their home turf of the U.S., the tech giants can now add their most important emerging market to the list of countries whose regulators are paying closer attention. Policy changes have the potential to slow down the companies in a market that’s already the largest for some of them in terms of the number of users.

‘Take Control’

“Governments everywhere are trying to take control of the free flow of information and not relinquish it to any one social or technology company,” said Ashutosh Sharma, research director at Forrester Research Inc. “We’re moving towards a world where social media will be regulated in some form or the other.”

“The details of rules like these matter and we will carefully study the new rules that were just published,” a Facebook India spokeswoman said in an emailed response. “Facebook is committed to people’s ability to freely and safely express themselves on our platforms.

Local representatives of Whatsapp, Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ Hotstar didn’t immediately comment on the new regulations.

Large social media platforms will need to appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person, a grievance officer, all of them resident in India, according to Prasad, India’s minister of electronics and information technology. “Platforms will be required to give monthly compliance reports,” he said, and companies have three months to ahere to the new rules.

Story continues

Increased Censorship

The new rules replace a previous code from 2011. Draft versions that have been circulating recently have attracted criticism from freedom-of-speech activists and technology trade groups concerned the rules will result in increased censorship and reduced user privacy.

“The Rules could undermine the principles of open and accessible internet,” New Delhi-based Software Freedom Law Center said in an emailed comment. The “traceability provision” will undermine the end-to-end encryption services offered by instant messaging platforms as well as the privacy of private communication, it said.

India’s fast-growing digital economy is headed toward 1 billion users by 2025, prompting the deep-pocketed corporations to battle for market share in everything from online retail and digital payments to messaging and streaming.

Facebook’s namesake social network is used by 410 million people in India and its WhatsApp messaging service by 530 million, said Prasad, while YouTube has 448 million users, Instagram 210 million and Twitter 17.5 million.

Besides the global giants, the new rules -- called Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code -- are set to affect a swath of Indian startups. Beyond streaming and messaging, the code will also set guidelines for digital publishers of news and current-affairs content.

The social media platforms were becoming increasing rife with fake news and were being used to hurt religious sentiments, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement after the media conference.“Over the years, the increasing instances of misuse of social media by criminals, anti-national elements have brought new challenges for law enforcement agencies,” the ministry said. “ These include inducement for recruitment of terrorists, circulation of obscene content, spread of disharmony, financial frauds, incitement of violence, public order etc.”

The new guidelines follow the Indian government’s dispute with Twitter over allegedly inflammatory tweets supporting farmer protests, with the messaging service refusing to comply with certain blocking orders. Meanwhile, an Amazon Prime Video original series “Tandav” was ordered by authorities to be re-edited following protests over its depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses.

The new rules “have the potential to fundamentally change how the internet is accessed and used by millions of users across India,” India-based digital liberties campaigner, Internet Freedom Foundation said on its website. Any attempts to weaken encryption would “undermine the privacy and security of all users,” it said.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: To build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with and thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena. And my thought process was at the time, it was a $30 billion industry, give or take.

Just the film side, it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size. There were a lot of the German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures.

And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem-- use the global distribution that after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me.

Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend. And sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out-- was pretty darn good. And-- but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I always used to say I wasn't joking. I just say, can we get your catering order right? Like how do we-- Their film is a collaborative process. And you make a movie, or you're about to make a movie. And the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes.

Story continues

And with Chris, I'm not kidding. We would just say thank you so much for-- we're very glad that we're financing your movie. And we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. And it was evident very early ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie. And he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since? I mean, you look at what-- the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID. And maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation?

THOMAS TULL: So a couple of things. I think COVID is impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. One of the reasons that I thought it was the right time at least for me to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business and you look at the way-- making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid and secondary windows and so forth-- all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right? They're based on completely different metrics that are media companies is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for, Oh, I guess they did, because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw-dropping.

I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones."" Or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon. They're compelling, right? They're big cinematic experiences.

Now, as someone that as a fan loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope I think is important. I love doing that growing up. And I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen.

But I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, and, of course, that home entertainment gets better and better and better. And movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX. And some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room much accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you have thousands of venues, right? What that coordination-- what that bill-- what that looks like-- it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now and what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable. And we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters, like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters the thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look, the thing that to me is compelling and amazing is, used to be something was a two-ish-hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television. And some small variations now, you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes.

But no, I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination. And sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it. I was always in awe. When we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment, it was kind of surreal.

So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers, like besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg-- all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric. And we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dont-miss-glamour-hollywood-legendary-110000708.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMC.US', 'AMZN.US', 'CMCSA.US', 'DIS.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'IHSEF.US', 'JIJAX.US', 'LOW.US', 'NFLX.US', 'QQQ.US', 'T-PA.US', 'T-PC.US', 'T.US', 'VZ.US']","['ANDY SERWER', 'CHRIS NOLAN', 'THOMAS TULL']","{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.146}"

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: How does one go from running a chain of laundromats to becoming one of the top producers in Hollywood? Just ask Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Entertainment and financier behind many of the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. After a long string of big budget successes like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Jurassic World,"" Tull chose to walk away from the bright lights in search of his next venture.

Now he's got his eyes on the future, using his deep pockets and vast network to invest in areas like next-gen technology and artificial intelligence. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco, as we discuss his experience in the movie business, his ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the one piece of advice that Warren Buffett once shared about investing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Thomas Tull, who is the founder and CEO of holding company Tulco and a member of the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thomas, great to see you.

THOMAS TULL: You too, Andy. Nice to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So why don't we start off by telling us what Tulco is all about.

THOMAS TULL: Well, it's a holding company structure. And the idea was to find companies that are in spaces that are large but traditionally have not had a lot of technical innovation. And then inside the holding company, we had a group, the tech group that we call Labs, and be able to bring that group's wherewithal and skill sets into these companies to not only provide the capital but the expertise to hopefully transform the businesses to make them much more efficient.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: You've had this incredible career arc. You went from laundromats, to taxes, to Legendary Entertainment, and now this. And we're going to get in all that stuff, but what's sort of the common thread here, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Extreme luck, I guess. But, you know, part of it I think is I'm not-- I wouldn't be good at sort of inventing a new thing that never existed before. If I have any skills, I think it's to look at a company, a sector, an ecosystem, and maybe to be able to find ways to make it more efficient hopefully to have some level of pattern recognition to say, well, these are some methodologies or financial, technical, et cetera, that may work to make this more valuable, and then to do your homework and then go into the space and hopefully to come out successfully.

ANDY SERWER: Let's drill down into Tulco a little bit more. What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called FIGS, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And, obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is and the workers that are on the front line each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So, it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

ANDY SERWER: Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure, and Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman who was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group, certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing, hopefully, some business acumen and then the tech side, but it just allows us a lot of flexibility.

We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right. So I can see that it's not private equity, per se, or venture or anything like that. You have permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about a business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and there was a moment-- I don't think he'd mind me sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about, and he stopped me. And he goes, I got to be honest, for years Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

And I kind of laughed. And he said, no. I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations, and, you know, he's incredibly sharp, and it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.

ANDY SERWER: That is a great nugget. I love that, just to avoid the dumb thing is more important than finding this absolute incredibly smart thing, right?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: So getting back to your insurance operation for a minute, Thomas, I notice that Russell Wilson and his wife, Sierra, have joined in that endeavor somehow, correct?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. It's a joint venture with Acrisure on a separate company. It's part of the Acrisure universe, and they're wonderful people. I've been friends with them socially for years, and just absolute stand up people. And I think making sure that this company not only is profitable but is targeted in a way that allows folks to be included in everything that we want to do. And Russell and Sierra great ambassadors for that, and I think it's very important.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us a little bit about AI. You mentioned how important that is. This is an expertise that's core to your business, and how important do you think this is to the economy going forward?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think every corner of our economy over the next decade is going to be touched by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I think that, done well, it's the human machine interface that makes us more efficient, more thoughtful, and allows us to be not wasteful and, again, to find patterns and find ways that we can be smarter about the way that we approach things, or less dumb if you want to use Warren's axiom.

And so I think that if you're applying it in ways that make sense-- because I think there's a lot of, certainly, in talk about big data and how you use big data. That's great, but it has to be actionable. It has to be measurable, and you have to be able to point to it and say, look, we applied artificial intelligence. We applied data science, and here are the results that we got. It's not magic.

It's just, I think, at the confluence of what situations are appropriate and right to apply it. What can be automated? And then from a jobs perspective, how do we make people free up their time, and how do we do things better, and what other jobs can that open up in the economy?

ANDY SERWER: You've gone from sort of these high profile business in Legendary into sort of more of a nuts and bolts part of the economy. Do you miss the glam of Hollywood?

THOMAS TULL: I don't. Look, it was a wonderful experience. I met some amazing people. I enjoyed the storytelling aspect, and now I'm enjoying the chapter I'm in now. So, again, it was a privilege to be a part of and something that I'm proud of, but I am really enjoying what I'm doing right now.

ANDY SERWER: When you think about these businesses that you're in right now, Thomas, do you talk about or think about how they compete with what's going on with similar kinds of businesses in China, and what do you think the United States' policy should be with regard to China?

THOMAS TULL: Well, that's a very big question. I think that it's important to recognize where we can have common ground, and I think it's also important to recognize where I think we have to take a tough stance on what's fair. And I think the time has certainly come on intellectual property and on technology and practices that don't put us on equal footing to really kind of demand that we reach an accord in agreement.

And I'm hopeful that that can happen because I think it's obviously in everybody's best interest, but when you're talking about being competitive globally, I think it's naive and Pollyanna to not think about the ways in which, if you're competing with Chinese companies, they do have some distinct advantages. And so I think you have to take that into account and just recognize that that's the way it is. Like, you can try to wish it away, but that that's not going to help very much.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you were owned by-- when you were at Legendary, you were owned by a Chinese company, Wanda, in the later history of Legendary. What was that like?

THOMAS TULL: Well, after we sold the company to them, I was there for a short amount of time to sort of transition it over. And look, you know, they had plans and goals, and they also owned AMC. So there was some thought process that went into that, definitely different but, you know, they were a big-- are a big company and certainly had theme parks and theaters and things of that nature. So it was definitely a different pivot, but I was only there for a short amount of time after the transaction.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us, though, about building Legendary Entertainment because, boy, that's a pretty unusual thing because most of the studios, obviously, are decades and decades old. So to build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with that thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena, and my thought process was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, give or take. Just the film side it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size.

And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem, use their global distribution that, after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me. Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you know, thousands of venues, right, what that coordination, what that bill, what that looks like, it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now in what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable, and we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters a thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look. The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is used to be something was a two-ish hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television and some small variations. Now you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes, but no. I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination, and sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.

I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment. It was kind of surreal. So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers like, besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg, all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric, and we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.

ANDY SERWER: Let me switch over and ask you about football a little bit, Thomas. How would you assess the recently completed NFL season? One for the ages, no doubt.

THOMAS TULL: I think the league actually did a phenomenal job. If you stop and think about every game was played under less than ideal circumstances, and we had playoffs. We had a Super Bowl. I thought it was a powerful moment when those 7,500 front line health care workers were at the Super Bowl. I thought that was incredibly powerful. You know, the crazy thing about this period of time, and you think about what teachers are going through, you know? Certainly health care workers, normal people trying to figure out and navigate their way through this.

There's no playbook for any of this. So, you know, on one hand, you want to constantly be thinking about what is best, and you have to put the players and the fans and everybody's personal safety must be the guiding light. And at the same time, so many fans, I mean, just personally and then for the league saying, please. Don't take away-- you know, football is important, and that sort of escapism certainly nowhere near as important-- I don't want to be mistaken for saying that football is something that had to go on, but just to provide some level of entertainment and normalcy I thought was important.

And I think the league did a really nice job getting through this, certainly we'll remember it forever, and I really hope we don't have to do it again, and we can return to some level of normalcy. But, you know, I'm glad that we played. Obviously, the end didn't turn out too well for our team, but just to see the games played and see it through I thought was an accomplishment.

ANDY SERWER: Let me pick up on that one point you just made there about next season, though. What do you think the chances are of it being a normal season next fall?

THOMAS TULL: Well, depending on what normal's definition is. Do I think there will be fans? Is it going to be full? I have no idea, but do I think fans will regularly attend? I'm personally optimistic, right? Do I think that perhaps checkpoints and masks might be a part of that equation somewhere? That's not hard to envision. Do I think testing is going to be a part of it, player safety, all those things? Certainly, I do.

I'm rooting for our entire country on the vaccine front to try to get things distributed as quickly as we can, especially to people that need it the most. And, you know, hopefully we can all get back to living. And I think about everything from small business owners who, you know, are trying to make it to the other side of this, which is really the backbone of this country. And, you know, on the other hand, I think what some of the scientists have pulled off in terms of these vaccines, I really think we're going to look back in time and realize what a monumental achievement it is.

I mean, I'm not fluent in biomed, but friends that are that are into deep research who just said, you have no idea what an accomplishment it is at this speed and velocity to pull this off. And so hopefully that gets rolled out, and we can move ahead.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the Steelers, Thomas? How are they looking for next year in your quarterback situation?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. It's all complicated certainly by the fact we just found out what the cap number is going to be. You know, Ben has been-- he's somebody I'm close to, but he's also one of the greatest Steelers of all time. He's won a couple of Super Bowls, and hopefully everything can be worked out. But at the same time, I think that just this whole year just had a lot of uniqueness to it, but I'm hopeful that it can work out.

He certainly is going to go down on the Mount Rushmore of Steeler players, and so I know that they're talking-- Mr. Rooney, our principal owner, and Kevin Colbert and Coach Tomlin and, you know, they always do a good job. So we'll see what happens.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of Coach Tomlin, the NFL only has three black coaches. What's wrong here, and how do you fix that?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. I had the privilege of being close to Mr. Rooney, Mr. Dan Rooney, who the Rooney Rule is named for. I cannot express what a fine human being he was. I miss him dearly. And recently, his wife had passed away, just the classiest people you ever want to know, and it was so important to him. And I think that we have to-- it's great that we have an interview process, but I think we have to be able to do more.

And I think part of that is what sort of other support can we provide, and I know we have some amazing coaches. There are candidates I'd certainly like to see have head coach, maybe not in our division because they're incredibly talented, but I think it's something that you have to constantly weigh and measure and not just say, hey, we put a rule in place. You know, you're doing the best that you can.

Well, if it's not working, what else can we do to keep progressing forward and make sure that we're doing that? I mean, one of the most profound experiences of my life, to go back to the movie thing, but I had the absolute pleasure of-- we made the movie ""42"" about Jackie Robinson. And certainly, that experience frames a lot of my thinking. And, you know, the opportunity that we all get a real shot, right? And, you know, are weighed on the merits, but that we have justice, and we're treated the same before the law, and that we have an opportunity.

If we have the skills, then we should be able to fill those spots. And I think we have a lot of work to go because we're not there yet. So I think we just have to constantly ask ourselves, what's working, what isn't working, and what can we tweak to make sure that this is dynamic and is ever changing to rise to the challenge?

ANDY SERWER: Let me go from football to baseball. Curt Schilling asked to be removed from the ballot for the Hall of Fame. You sit on the Hall of Fame board and will make the decision on it. Should he stay on the ballot or be removed, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: You know, these are just incredibly unique times. I know that we're going to be briefed on the situation. You know, I'd love to know really what the thinking is, but look, on the other hand, if a player says, I don't want to be associated or considered with the Hall of Fame, which I think is a privilege, then I'm not sure that player should be considered.

I mean, you have to take each individual case, and I certainly want to learn more. But to me, what would be ideal is to have the Hall of Fame be sort of away from politics and away from things of that nature and just say, hey, it's here to celebrate the game of baseball and certainly the right conduct and all those other things, but you just hate to see things get twisted up is all.

ANDY SERWER: You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking about whether anyone had ever turned down an induction. People have turned down Oscars before.

THOMAS TULL: Mm-hm.

ANDY SERWER: Right? Just putting that out there. It's interesting.

THOMAS TULL: Sure.

ANDY SERWER: It's part of the thinking.

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. That's one of the things just overall that I think is great about this country and the freedom it affords is that I don't have to agree with everything that you say, and hopefully we're able in a civil way to exchange ideas and not be afraid to exchange ideas in a civil tone. And, you know, hopefully we can progress to that place.

ANDY SERWER: You grew up in a low income family raised by a single mom in upstate New York, earned an athletic scholarship to a NESCAC school-- got to get a NESCAC pitch in there-- Hamilton College.

THOMAS TULL: Yup.

ANDY SERWER: I'm a NESCAC guy, too. Launched laundromats, as I mentioned, after graduation. So how did that early life experience shape you, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think knowing what it feels like to truly-- you know, there's not another euphemism. We were poor. I mean, if you know what it's like to go to bed hungry or have the lights turned off, you know, it has an impact. And I also looked at my mother who's a dental hygienist and she worked two jobs, and I watched her do that and do whatever was necessary, and just day after day.

And that's, I think thematically for me, that there are heroes that do amazing things in the moment they're called upon. I'm also always impressed with people that answer the bell every day, right, that are doing things when no one's looking and there's no extra credit, right? It's not on Instagram. It's just, hey, I'm getting up and I'm doing what I need to do, and I think that's heroic in itself. You know, my grandmother, her mother was a hospital cleaning lady, which is one of the toughest jobs that I can think of.

And so I just think, from a young age, understanding that you better have resiliency and that, whether you like it or not, whatever the circumstances are, that's what you have to deal with. So, you know, any of that certainly comes from them and from the experiences I had. And then the other side of it, anybody who gets anywhere, I think, has to make peace with the fact that there is absolutely luck involved because things could go inch to the left, inch to the right, and your life is completely different.

And I try to really keep that in mind that if you start to think, jeez, I'm in a different place and pretty special, you better keep that thinking at bay because I think that it's not correct, and it's dangerous thinking.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, Thomas, have you thought about what you'd like your legacy to be?

THOMAS TULL: Look, I feel like every single day I get to live a life that I couldn't even imagine. So I think, hopefully, my number one thing is I've got two 11-year-old twin boys that are at the center of my world, and being a good father is a very big deal to me. And I'd also say just that, you know, doing the things that I have the reach or impact to be able to do to help because I think, in our country citizenship, is something that you have to work at it. You have an obligation to be informed.

And if you have the opportunity through philanthropically or some way to help to be impactful in your community, you have to do those things. And so I just hope that-- you have to earn that every single day. And so I think a lot about that and, you know, but I'm in a place that I'm still trying to earn that rather than thinking about what it is. So hopefully we can keep it going.

ANDY SERWER: Sounds good. Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco. Thank you so much for your time.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: How does one go from running a chain of laundromats to becoming one of the top producers in Hollywood? Just ask Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Entertainment and financier behind many of the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. After a long string of big budget successes like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Jurassic World,"" Tull chose to walk away from the bright lights in search of his next venture.

Now he's got his eyes on the future, using his deep pockets and vast network to invest in areas like next-gen technology and artificial intelligence. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco, as we discuss his experience in the movie business, his ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the one piece of advice that Warren Buffett once shared about investing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Thomas Tull, who is the founder and CEO of holding company Tulco and a member of the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thomas, great to see you.

THOMAS TULL: You too, Andy. Nice to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So why don't we start off by telling us what Tulco is all about.

THOMAS TULL: Well, it's a holding company structure. And the idea was to find companies that are in spaces that are large but traditionally have not had a lot of technical innovation. And then inside the holding company, we had a group, the tech group that we call Labs, and be able to bring that group's wherewithal and skill sets into these companies to not only provide the capital but the expertise to hopefully transform the businesses to make them much more efficient.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: You've had this incredible career arc. You went from laundromats, to taxes, to Legendary Entertainment, and now this. And we're going to get in all that stuff, but what's sort of the common thread here, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Extreme luck, I guess. But, you know, part of it I think is I'm not-- I wouldn't be good at sort of inventing a new thing that never existed before. If I have any skills, I think it's to look at a company, a sector, an ecosystem, and maybe to be able to find ways to make it more efficient hopefully to have some level of pattern recognition to say, well, these are some methodologies or financial, technical, et cetera, that may work to make this more valuable, and then to do your homework and then go into the space and hopefully to come out successfully.

ANDY SERWER: Let's drill down into Tulco a little bit more. What are the companies that you've been looking at, investing in, and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?

THOMAS TULL: Well, we're in a number of sectors. We're in insurance with Acrisure. They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years and to apply that to their entire platform. So we're very excited about that. It's obviously a large sector and something that we think has some room to grow in terms of the way we look at it and what the broker of the future is going to look like.

We are in a company called FIGS, which is a health care workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company. And, obviously, over this past year, I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is and the workers that are on the front line each and every day. So that's a company we're really proud of.

We're an investor in a company called RoadRunner, which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model. We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems, and a few others. So, it's diverse, but it's worked well for us.

ANDY SERWER: Is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway?

THOMAS TULL: Oh my goodness. Well, you just named-- I mean, in structure, and Marty Willhite, who's the vice chairman who was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group, certainly, I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett. But just to me, what I like about it is it's not a fund. It's permanent capital. It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies, make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing, hopefully, some business acumen and then the tech side, but it just allows us a lot of flexibility.

We don't have pressures on vintage year funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right. So I can see that it's not private equity, per se, or venture or anything like that. You have permanent capital. I get it. Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about a business at all ever, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. I had the privilege of sitting with Warren for almost two hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond a privilege. It's something I'll treasure for the rest of my life, and there was a moment-- I don't think he'd mind me sharing this-- where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something. And I said, what we're trying to do is to be smart about, and he stopped me. And he goes, I got to be honest, for years Charlie and I have always asked, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

And I kind of laughed. And he said, no. I'm dead serious. We always ask. We don't want to be in the clever pile. What could we do here that would be the dumb thing, and how do we avoid it? Honestly, it actually has had a fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations, and, you know, he's incredibly sharp, and it's something, again, that time I'll treasure forever.

ANDY SERWER: That is a great nugget. I love that, just to avoid the dumb thing is more important than finding this absolute incredibly smart thing, right?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: So getting back to your insurance operation for a minute, Thomas, I notice that Russell Wilson and his wife, Sierra, have joined in that endeavor somehow, correct?

THOMAS TULL: Yeah. It's a joint venture with Acrisure on a separate company. It's part of the Acrisure universe, and they're wonderful people. I've been friends with them socially for years, and just absolute stand up people. And I think making sure that this company not only is profitable but is targeted in a way that allows folks to be included in everything that we want to do. And Russell and Sierra great ambassadors for that, and I think it's very important.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us a little bit about AI. You mentioned how important that is. This is an expertise that's core to your business, and how important do you think this is to the economy going forward?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think every corner of our economy over the next decade is going to be touched by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And I think that, done well, it's the human machine interface that makes us more efficient, more thoughtful, and allows us to be not wasteful and, again, to find patterns and find ways that we can be smarter about the way that we approach things, or less dumb if you want to use Warren's axiom.

And so I think that if you're applying it in ways that make sense-- because I think there's a lot of, certainly, in talk about big data and how you use big data. That's great, but it has to be actionable. It has to be measurable, and you have to be able to point to it and say, look, we applied artificial intelligence. We applied data science, and here are the results that we got. It's not magic.

It's just, I think, at the confluence of what situations are appropriate and right to apply it. What can be automated? And then from a jobs perspective, how do we make people free up their time, and how do we do things better, and what other jobs can that open up in the economy?

ANDY SERWER: You've gone from sort of these high profile business in Legendary into sort of more of a nuts and bolts part of the economy. Do you miss the glam of Hollywood?

THOMAS TULL: I don't. Look, it was a wonderful experience. I met some amazing people. I enjoyed the storytelling aspect, and now I'm enjoying the chapter I'm in now. So, again, it was a privilege to be a part of and something that I'm proud of, but I am really enjoying what I'm doing right now.

ANDY SERWER: When you think about these businesses that you're in right now, Thomas, do you talk about or think about how they compete with what's going on with similar kinds of businesses in China, and what do you think the United States' policy should be with regard to China?

THOMAS TULL: Well, that's a very big question. I think that it's important to recognize where we can have common ground, and I think it's also important to recognize where I think we have to take a tough stance on what's fair. And I think the time has certainly come on intellectual property and on technology and practices that don't put us on equal footing to really kind of demand that we reach an accord in agreement.

And I'm hopeful that that can happen because I think it's obviously in everybody's best interest, but when you're talking about being competitive globally, I think it's naive and Pollyanna to not think about the ways in which, if you're competing with Chinese companies, they do have some distinct advantages. And so I think you have to take that into account and just recognize that that's the way it is. Like, you can try to wish it away, but that that's not going to help very much.

ANDY SERWER: I mean, you were owned by-- when you were at Legendary, you were owned by a Chinese company, Wanda, in the later history of Legendary. What was that like?

THOMAS TULL: Well, after we sold the company to them, I was there for a short amount of time to sort of transition it over. And look, you know, they had plans and goals, and they also owned AMC. So there was some thought process that went into that, definitely different but, you know, they were a big-- are a big company and certainly had theme parks and theaters and things of that nature. So it was definitely a different pivot, but I was only there for a short amount of time after the transaction.

ANDY SERWER: Talk to us, though, about building Legendary Entertainment because, boy, that's a pretty unusual thing because most of the studios, obviously, are decades and decades old. So to build a new company from scratch must be an incredible accomplishment or feel like an incredible accomplishment for you.

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think that when I first went out to raise capital and put it together, I think that there were a lot of folks that I met with that thought it was straight up crazy. I had zero experience in movies and television in that arena, and my thought process was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, give or take. Just the film side it was, I believe, the country's second biggest export. And yet, there was no institutional capital around the business, which was highly unusual for a business of that size.

There were a lot of-- you know, they do German tax funds and sort of these unusual structures. And so I thought if I could build a company that was adjacent to that ecosystem, use their global distribution that, after studying the financials, there was a way through if you made great content. I was very fortunate to have partnered with Warner Brothers. They were great to me. Alan Horn, who was running at the time and is now at Disney, was an incredible mentor and still a dear friend.

And, you know, sometimes you just get lucky. We met a young director named Chris Nolan who turned out was pretty darn good. And, you know, but it was definitely different in terms of business and understanding how things worked and why they worked and et cetera. But, you know, it was definitely an interesting journey.

ANDY SERWER: I have to ask you about Christopher Nolan. I mean, he really is some kind of genius. What was it like to work with him?

THOMAS TULL: You know, I was used to saying I wasn't joking. I'd just say, can we get your catering order right? Like, how do we-- you know, film is a collaborative process. And, you know, you make a movie or you're about to make a movie, and the studio gives their notes. The producer gives their notes. We certainly give our notes. And with Chris, I'm not kidding, we would just say, thank you so much. We're very glad that we're financing your movie, and we'll see you at the premiere. I mean, he really, I think, is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and it was evident very early. ""Batman Begins"" was our first movie, and he's just incredibly talented and continues to go on and make amazing things.

ANDY SERWER: Have you thought about the business much since. I mean, you look, the business has gotten completely turned upside down with COVID, and maybe there's some inefficiencies ripe for innovation.

THOMAS TULL: You know, so a couple of things. I think COVID has impacted all of us in so many ways. I think it's accelerated what was already happening. You know, one of the reasons that I thought it was the right time, at least for me, to exit the business is when you look at the theatrical exhibition business, and you look at the way making a movie, putting it out, getting your theatrical run, then getting paid in secondary windows and so forth, all of a sudden when you have the streaming services whose multiples and market caps are completely different, right-- they're based on completely different metrics than a media companies-- is able with almost unlimited resources to make movies.

And I would hear some people in the business say, yeah, but the biggest, most talented actors and directors aren't going to go work for-- oh, I guess they did, right? Because the size and scope of some of the things that are being made is jaw dropping. I mean, you look at ""Game of Thrones"", or you look at some of the big series that Netflix is doing or Amazon, they're compelling, right?

They're big cinematic experiences. Now, as someone that, as a fan, loves movies, there are certain films going and sitting in a cinema in that sort of venue and scope, I think, is important. I loved doing that growing up, and I don't pretend to know exactly what's going to happen, but I think people are also getting so used to watching, listening, experiencing things on demand when they want to watch and experience them that things by appointment are harder and harder to pull off because it's a fundamentally different experience.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. And of course, the home entertainment gets better and better and better, and movie theaters didn't really keep pace. I mean, there is IMAX and some of them try to have better seats and stuff. But on the whole, the advances in your living room accelerated much faster than the advances in the movie theaters.

THOMAS TULL: Yeah, and it's tough. Look, when you talk about completely changing, you know, thousands of venues, right, what that coordination, what that bill, what that looks like, it was tough on them. So I have every sympathy for theater owners and especially now in what they're going through. I just think that change is inevitable, and we're just seeing the acceleration of that change through this period of time.

ANDY SERWER: You made blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic World."" Are blockbusters a thing of the past?

THOMAS TULL: I don't think so. I mean, look. The thing that to me is compelling and amazing is used to be something was a two-ish hour movie or a 13 series-- 13 episode series on television and some small variations. Now you can do almost anything. The duration of the story is not contained within one of those boxes, but no. I think there is still something special about collectively going and seeing something that is bigger than imagination, and sort of everyone in the world is buzzing and talking about it.

I was always in awe when we would put something out that would capture the imagination for a moment. It was kind of surreal. So I hope that that doesn't happen. I mean, you have filmmakers like, besides Chris Nolan, you have Jim Cameron, Steven Spielberg, all these incredible storytellers. And I think at the heart of this that it's part of our cultural fabric, and we're going to continue to see great storytellers come to the forefront. It's just, I think, going to be viewed and experienced slightly differently.

ANDY SERWER: Let me switch over and ask you about football a little bit, Thomas. How would you assess the recently completed NFL season? One for the ages, no doubt.

THOMAS TULL: I think the league actually did a phenomenal job. If you stop and think about every game was played under less than ideal circumstances, and we had playoffs. We had a Super Bowl. I thought it was a powerful moment when those 7,500 front line health care workers were at the Super Bowl. I thought that was incredibly powerful. You know, the crazy thing about this period of time, and you think about what teachers are going through, you know? Certainly health care workers, normal people trying to figure out and navigate their way through this.

There's no playbook for any of this. So, you know, on one hand, you want to constantly be thinking about what is best, and you have to put the players and the fans and everybody's personal safety must be the guiding light. And at the same time, so many fans, I mean, just personally and then for the league saying, please. Don't take away-- you know, football is important, and that sort of escapism certainly nowhere near as important-- I don't want to be mistaken for saying that football is something that had to go on, but just to provide some level of entertainment and normalcy I thought was important.

And I think the league did a really nice job getting through this, certainly we'll remember it forever, and I really hope we don't have to do it again, and we can return to some level of normalcy. But, you know, I'm glad that we played. Obviously, the end didn't turn out too well for our team, but just to see the games played and see it through I thought was an accomplishment.

ANDY SERWER: Let me pick up on that one point you just made there about next season, though. What do you think the chances are of it being a normal season next fall?

THOMAS TULL: Well, depending on what normal's definition is. Do I think there will be fans? Is it going to be full? I have no idea, but do I think fans will regularly attend? I'm personally optimistic, right? Do I think that perhaps checkpoints and masks might be a part of that equation somewhere? That's not hard to envision. Do I think testing is going to be a part of it, player safety, all those things? Certainly, I do.

I'm rooting for our entire country on the vaccine front to try to get things distributed as quickly as we can, especially to people that need it the most. And, you know, hopefully we can all get back to living. And I think about everything from small business owners who, you know, are trying to make it to the other side of this, which is really the backbone of this country. And, you know, on the other hand, I think what some of the scientists have pulled off in terms of these vaccines, I really think we're going to look back in time and realize what a monumental achievement it is.

I mean, I'm not fluent in biomed, but friends that are that are into deep research who just said, you have no idea what an accomplishment it is at this speed and velocity to pull this off. And so hopefully that gets rolled out, and we can move ahead.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the Steelers, Thomas? How are they looking for next year in your quarterback situation?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. It's all complicated certainly by the fact we just found out what the cap number is going to be. You know, Ben has been-- he's somebody I'm close to, but he's also one of the greatest Steelers of all time. He's won a couple of Super Bowls, and hopefully everything can be worked out. But at the same time, I think that just this whole year just had a lot of uniqueness to it, but I'm hopeful that it can work out.

He certainly is going to go down on the Mount Rushmore of Steeler players, and so I know that they're talking-- Mr. Rooney, our principal owner, and Kevin Colbert and Coach Tomlin and, you know, they always do a good job. So we'll see what happens.

ANDY SERWER: Speaking of Coach Tomlin, the NFL only has three black coaches. What's wrong here, and how do you fix that?

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. I had the privilege of being close to Mr. Rooney, Mr. Dan Rooney, who the Rooney Rule is named for. I cannot express what a fine human being he was. I miss him dearly. And recently, his wife had passed away, just the classiest people you ever want to know, and it was so important to him. And I think that we have to-- it's great that we have an interview process, but I think we have to be able to do more.

And I think part of that is what sort of other support can we provide, and I know we have some amazing coaches. There are candidates I'd certainly like to see have head coach, maybe not in our division because they're incredibly talented, but I think it's something that you have to constantly weigh and measure and not just say, hey, we put a rule in place. You know, you're doing the best that you can.

Well, if it's not working, what else can we do to keep progressing forward and make sure that we're doing that? I mean, one of the most profound experiences of my life, to go back to the movie thing, but I had the absolute pleasure of-- we made the movie ""42"" about Jackie Robinson. And certainly, that experience frames a lot of my thinking. And, you know, the opportunity that we all get a real shot, right? And, you know, are weighed on the merits, but that we have justice, and we're treated the same before the law, and that we have an opportunity.

If we have the skills, then we should be able to fill those spots. And I think we have a lot of work to go because we're not there yet. So I think we just have to constantly ask ourselves, what's working, what isn't working, and what can we tweak to make sure that this is dynamic and is ever changing to rise to the challenge?

ANDY SERWER: Let me go from football to baseball. Curt Schilling asked to be removed from the ballot for the Hall of Fame. You sit on the Hall of Fame board and will make the decision on it. Should he stay on the ballot or be removed, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: You know, these are just incredibly unique times. I know that we're going to be briefed on the situation. You know, I'd love to know really what the thinking is, but look, on the other hand, if a player says, I don't want to be associated or considered with the Hall of Fame, which I think is a privilege, then I'm not sure that player should be considered.

I mean, you have to take each individual case, and I certainly want to learn more. But to me, what would be ideal is to have the Hall of Fame be sort of away from politics and away from things of that nature and just say, hey, it's here to celebrate the game of baseball and certainly the right conduct and all those other things, but you just hate to see things get twisted up is all.

ANDY SERWER: You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking about whether anyone had ever turned down an induction. People have turned down Oscars before.

THOMAS TULL: Mm-hm.

ANDY SERWER: Right? Just putting that out there. It's interesting.

THOMAS TULL: Sure.

ANDY SERWER: It's part of the thinking.

THOMAS TULL: Well, look. That's one of the things just overall that I think is great about this country and the freedom it affords is that I don't have to agree with everything that you say, and hopefully we're able in a civil way to exchange ideas and not be afraid to exchange ideas in a civil tone. And, you know, hopefully we can progress to that place.

ANDY SERWER: You grew up in a low income family raised by a single mom in upstate New York, earned an athletic scholarship to a NESCAC school-- got to get a NESCAC pitch in there-- Hamilton College.

THOMAS TULL: Yup.

ANDY SERWER: I'm a NESCAC guy, too. Launched laundromats, as I mentioned, after graduation. So how did that early life experience shape you, Thomas?

THOMAS TULL: Well, I think knowing what it feels like to truly-- you know, there's not another euphemism. We were poor. I mean, if you know what it's like to go to bed hungry or have the lights turned off, you know, it has an impact. And I also looked at my mother who's a dental hygienist and she worked two jobs, and I watched her do that and do whatever was necessary, and just day after day.

And that's, I think thematically for me, that there are heroes that do amazing things in the moment they're called upon. I'm also always impressed with people that answer the bell every day, right, that are doing things when no one's looking and there's no extra credit, right? It's not on Instagram. It's just, hey, I'm getting up and I'm doing what I need to do, and I think that's heroic in itself. You know, my grandmother, her mother was a hospital cleaning lady, which is one of the toughest jobs that I can think of.

And so I just think, from a young age, understanding that you better have resiliency and that, whether you like it or not, whatever the circumstances are, that's what you have to deal with. So, you know, any of that certainly comes from them and from the experiences I had. And then the other side of it, anybody who gets anywhere, I think, has to make peace with the fact that there is absolutely luck involved because things could go inch to the left, inch to the right, and your life is completely different.

And I try to really keep that in mind that if you start to think, jeez, I'm in a different place and pretty special, you better keep that thinking at bay because I think that it's not correct, and it's dangerous thinking.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, Thomas, have you thought about what you'd like your legacy to be?

THOMAS TULL: Look, I feel like every single day I get to live a life that I couldn't even imagine. So I think, hopefully, my number one thing is I've got two 11-year-old twin boys that are at the center of my world, and being a good father is a very big deal to me. And I'd also say just that, you know, doing the things that I have the reach or impact to be able to do to help because I think, in our country citizenship, is something that you have to work at it. You have an obligation to be informed.

And if you have the opportunity through philanthropically or some way to help to be impactful in your community, you have to do those things. And so I just hope that-- you have to earn that every single day. And so I think a lot about that and, you know, but I'm in a place that I'm still trying to earn that rather than thinking about what it is. So hopefully we can keep it going.

ANDY SERWER: Sounds good. Thomas Tull, founder and CEO of Tulco. Thank you so much for your time.

THOMAS TULL: Thank you, Andy.

You can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.

Insider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.

Almost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.

Warren Buffett

We have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.

Since hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the ""best stocks to buy for beginner investors"". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.

Overall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS): $183

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA): $338.46

Number of Hedge Funds: 154 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 133 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $18 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.4% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -5.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 10 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 7 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Akre Capital Management, Berkshire Hathaway Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, express

7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA): $264.51

Number of Hedge Funds: 156 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 166 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $17.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 13.7% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 4 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 5 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Ken Fisher

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

6. Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG): $2,117.20

Number of Hedge Funds: 157 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $20.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.7% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 20.9% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 7 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 8 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Boykin Curry

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA): $338.46

Number of Hedge Funds: 154 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 133 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $18 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.4% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -5.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 10 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 7 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Akre Capital Management, Berkshire Hathaway Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, express

7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA): $264.51

Number of Hedge Funds: 156 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 166 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $17.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 13.7% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 4 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 5 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Ken Fisher

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

6. Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG): $2,117.20

Number of Hedge Funds: 157 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $20.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.7% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 20.9% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 7 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 8 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Boykin Curry

Greenlight Capital leader David Einhorn (Trades, Portfolio) disclosed his fourth-quarter portfolio earlier this week.

The activist investor's New York-based firm, which seeks to generate long-term capital appreciation by taking an approach rooted in emphasizing intrinsic value, invests in companies that have the potential to achieve consistent returns and safeguard capital regardless of market conditions. Einhorn is also known for his short positions, which include Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

During the quarter, Einhorn established 10 new holdings, sold out of 10 positions and added to or reduced a number of other existing investments. Among his most notable trades for the quarter were new positions in Danimer Scientific Inc. (NYSE:DNMR), FuboTV Inc. (NYSE:FUBO), Concentrix Corp. (NASDAQ:CNXC) and CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX), which was established following its merger with CONSOL Coal Resources LP (NYSE:CCR).

Danimer Scientific

Einhorn invested in 1.73 million shares of Danimer Scientific (NYSE:DNMR), allocating 2.44% of the equity portfolio to the stake. The stock traded for an average price of $23.66 per share during the quarter.

The Bainbridge, Georgia-based company formerly known as Meredian Holdings Group Inc., which manufactures biopolymer, has a $4.05 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $47.60 on Wednesday with a price-sales ratio of 62.55.

Shares of Danimer, which went public via special purpose acquisition company on Dec. 30, have gained over 90% so far. David Einhorn's Top 4 Buys of the 4th Quarter

GuruFocus rated Danimer's financial strength 4 out of 10.

Einhorn is the company's largest guru shareholder with a 2.03% stake. Louis Moore Bacon (Trades, Portfolio) also owns the stock.

FuboTV

The guru picked up 1.2 million shares of FuboTV (NYSE:FUBO), dedicating 2.05% of the equity portfolio to the position. Shares traded for an average price of $22.18 each during the quarter.

The sports-focused TV streaming service, which is headquartered in New York, has a market cap of $4.82 billion; its shares were trading around $45.25 on Wednesday with a price-sales ratio of 15.64.

The median price-sales chart shows the stock is trading above historical values, suggesting it is overpriced. David Einhorn's Top 4 Buys of the 4th Quarter

FuboTV's financial strength was rated 6 out of 10 by GuruFocus. As a result of issuing approximately $10.08 million in new long-term debt over the past three years, the company has weak interest coverage. The Altman Z-Score of 7, however, indicates it is in good standing even though the company has recorded losses in operating income over the last three years.

Weighed down by negative margins and returns that underperform a majority of competitors, the company's profitability scored a 1 out of 10 rating. It also has a low Piotroski F-Score of 3, suggesting poor operating conditions, and declining revenue per share.

With a 1.12% stake, Einhorn is FuboTV's largest guru shareholder. Bacon, Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) and Chuck Royce (Trades, Portfolio) also own the stock.

Concentrix

The investor entered a 334,882-share holding of Concentrix (NASDAQ:CNXC), giving it 1.99% space in the equity portfolio. During the quarter, shares traded for an average per-share price of $97.66.

The Fremont, California-based business services company, which specializes in customer engagement and business performance, has a $5.79 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $111.37 on Wednesday with a price-earnings ratio of 39.78, a price-book ratio of 2.49 and a price-sales ratio of 2.29.

Based on the Peter Lynch chart, the stock appears to be overvalued. David Einhorn's Top 4 Buys of the 4th Quarter

GuruFocus rated Concentrix's financial strength 5 out of 10 on the back of adequate interest coverage. The Altman Z-Score of 1.95, however, warns the company is under some financial pressure since the weighted average cost of capital eclipses the return on invested capital, indicating issues with creating value.

The company's profitability fared worse, scoring a 2 out of 10 rating despite having margins and returns that outperform over half of its industry peers.

Of the gurus invested in Concentrix, Sarah Ketterer (Trades, Portfolio) has the largest stake with 1.5% of outstanding shares. Royce, Tweedy Browne (Trades, Portfolio), First Pacific Advisors (Trades, Portfolio), the FPA Capital Fund (Trades, Portfolio) and Jones also own the stock.

CONSOL Energy

Following its merger with CONSOL Coal Resources on Dec. 30, Einhorn gained a 4 million-share stake in CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CEIX), impacting the equity portfolio by 1.74%.

CONSOL Energy's financial strength was rated 3 out of 10 by GuruFocus. In addition to a low cash-debt ratio, the Altman Z-Score of 0.5 warns the company could be in danger of bankruptcy if it does not improve its liquidity.

The company's profitability scored a 5 out of 10 rating, weighed down by negative margins. Its returns, however, outperform over half of its competitors. CONSOL also has a low Piotrosk F-Score of 3, suggesting business conditions are in poor shape, and revenue per share has been in decline for the past five years.

Einhorn has an 11.77% stake in the company, making him its largest shareholder among the gurus. Royce also owns the stock.

Additional trades and portfolio composition

During the quarter, Einhorn also sold out of Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ingredion Inc. (NYSE:INGR) as well as reduced his position in AerCap Holdings NV (NYSE:AER). Other new positions he established were ADT Inc. (ADT), Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp III (IPOC), EchoStar Corp. (SATS), Sonos Inc. (SONO), Aequi Acquisition Corp (ARBGU) and New Providence Acquisition Corp. (NPA).

The guru's $1.66 billion equity portfolio, which was composed of 36 stocks, is most heavily invested in the consumer cyclical sector with a weight of 36.12%. David Einhorn's Top 4 Buys of the 4th Quarter

Momentum investing is one of the most fundamental quantitative investment strategies for investors seeking profit. Basically, it is the strategy of buying high and selling even high. The term is similar to Newton’s first law of motion which states that when an object is in motion it tends to stay in motion unless a force is applied to it. In relation, a market in motion tends to stay in motion. Basically, trends tend to continue.

The strategy dates back to 2004, when Chicago-based fund manager, Richard Driehaus turned the practice into a strategy. Although he was not the first to use the strategy, he is often called the father of momentum investing. He started buying stocks that already had good price moves and holding on to it as long as the upward price movement continues. He emphasized his discipline in selling the losers as soon as he sees a downward trend and re-investing the money in others upward trend stocks.

Investing in the time of an economic recession can be one of the hardest decisions for an investor given the market volatility. In the contrary, momentum investing goes against the market by taking advantage of positions in rising stocks and selling them the moment they show signs of going down. A momentum investor is more attracted to stocks that have rising prices as an upward trend may seem most likely in a certain period of time. The idea is based on the possibility of a stock that establishes a trend will continue in that direction rather than go against it.15 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Now

If an investor has the ability to identify sectors quickly and accurately, investing in momentum stocks can offer a great chance to gain a winning trade and take profits higher than regular trading opportunities over a short period of time. For instance, in a study by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman covering the US stock returns between 1965-1989, momentum was a significant factor that generated an outperformance of as much as 12.01% per year on average. In a separate study by Grundy and Martin in 2001, where they used NYSE and AMEX listed stocks, it was concluded that momentum profits were stable even after adjustment for dynamic risk exposure.

In order to identify the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now, we started with the 126 holdings from the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF as of February 8, 2021, and we were able to narrow down our list to 15 stocks by using the hedge fund sentiment data.

In order to create the list of the best momentum stocks to buy now, we used our in-house hedge fund sentiment data. Our research has shown that by using the hedge fund sentiment data, we can identify a small group of stocks that can outperform the S&P 500 index on average by double digits annually. For instance, the portfolio for stock picks for our monthly newsletter has beaten the market by over 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see details here) Some of the portfolio choices for our monthly newsletter were also publicly shared on our website. In October, we posted this real estate stock since then it’s been up more than 60 percent.

Based on our hedge fund sentiment data, we present to you the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now among 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:

15. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

No of HFs: 67

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.17 Billion

TSLA is the 15th best momentum stock to buy now. At the end of September, a total of 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider purchased 1,250 shares at around $767 in February 2020. The stock is up 10% since then. Baron Opportunity Fund mentioned TSLA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, and energy storage solutions. The company reported robust second quarter results, solidly ahead of market expectations, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macro-economic challenges. Indeed, in the second quarter, Tesla delivered almost 91,000 total vehicles – with strong unit level economics of 25.4% GAAP automotive gross profit margins – and another quarter of GAAP profitability and solid free cash flow (above $400 million). Moreover, Tesla recently announced a record of nearly 140,000 total vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. Despite global COVID-19 disruptions, our long-term expectations remain high due to Tesla’s differentiated products and healthy unit economics. Tesla has announced capacity expansions in Shanghai, China; Berlin, Germany; and Austin, Texas to support its short-term path to 1 million vehicles and its long-term goal of 20 million. Just a couple of weeks ago, Tesla held its Battery Day event, and presented a grand vision around its battery innovation and expanding its competitive advantages, including massively increasing internal battery production capacity (100 gigawatt-hours by 2022 and 3,000 by 2030), improving battery range (about 50%), and significantly lowering battery costs (cost per kilowatt-hour to decline by over 50%). We remain confident that Tesla will leverage its brand, technology leadership, and the electric vehicle secular trend to achieve sustainable long-term growth.”

14. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.21 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $840 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1,000 shares at around $78 in April 2020. The stock is up 80% since then. L1 Capital International Fund mentioned NKE in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“We reduced our investment in Nike. Nike is performing extremely strongly in a challenging operating environment, gaining share and exceeding our expectations. However, the market has recognised Nike’s strong performance and after a substantial increase in the share price we consider the risk adjusted return potential only warrants a minimum position size.”

13. Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.70 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Dan Loeb’s Third Point which had $645 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 26,784 shares at around $226 in November 2020. The stock is up 4% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned DHR in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Danaher, which designs, manufactures, and markets life science, diagnostics, dental, environmental, and applied solutions, is a prime example of how to use the business strategy of “bolt-on” acquisitions. Led by capital allocation experts the Rales brothers, Danaher will purchase a company in a fragmented industry, create a strategic platform for providing a unique service, and then spin off the company when it can create even more value as an independent entity.

Since Danaher’s bolt-on acquisition of the biopharma business of General Electric’s Life Sciences division for $21.4 billion in March 2019, we have realized a gain of well over 100%. The move boosted Danaher’s stock from around $90 (our purchase price) to the $210s. A gain like this is one of the big upsides of investing in a serial acquirer.”

12. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO)

No of HFs: 80

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.97 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock.

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Raiv Jain’s GQG Partners which had $2.54 billion invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 100 shares at around $537 in December 2020. The stock is up 6% since then. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned NVDA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”

10. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)

“When Qualcomm was trading in the low $50s, we bought every share we could. Qualcomm stock rose to around $70 when Broadcom was set to acquire the company, but ultimately the deal did not go through. In April of this year, Qualcomm ended a lengthy and complicated legal battle with Apple over the licensing of Qualcomm’s chip technology in Apple’s mobile devices, including its iPhones. The settlement included a payout from Apple to Qualcomm rumored to be around $6 billion, as well as a six-year licensing agreement and a supply agreement guaranteeing that the chipmaker continue to provide its products to the largest company in the world. With this settlement and the expected increase in product shipments, Qualcomm anticipates an incremental earnings per share of $2. As Qualcomm shareholders, we were able to realize a gain of 54% over a short period of time.”

9. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

No of HFs: 104

Total Value of HF Holdings: $12.8 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 104 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider recently purchased 300 shares at $310 in August 2019. The stock is up 80% since then. Blue Hawk Investment Group mentioned NFLX in ts 4Q 2020 investor letter:

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

6. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

1-800 Flowers: One of the most popular gifts on Valentine’s Day is flowers. With restrictions still in place on local stores, consumers could turn to a company like 1-800-Flowers.com (NASDAQ: FLWS).

1-800-Flowers owns its namesake brand and other gift brands such as Harry & David, Personalization Mall, Shari’s Berries, Fruit Bouquets and The Popcorn Factory.

The company reported record second-quarter revenue recently for the period ending Dec. 27. This was up 44.8% year-over-year to $877.3 million, and was the seventh consecutive quarter of strong revenue growth, according to the company.

1-800-Flowers anticipates strong revenue growth for the Valentine’s Day holiday and sees its Sunday placement as a catalyst. The company also made several acquisitions in 2020 that could factor into growth ahead.

Netflix: If you’re one of the 203.6 million subscribers of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), you might spend Valentine’s Day partaking in “Netflix and Chill.” With restaurants closed and limited on capacity, couples could choose to dine at home and enjoy a movie or show on the popular streaming service.

Buying Netflix stock for your significant other could be a way to invest in the growing streaming market. Shares of the streaming giant are up over 500% in the last five years.

LVMH: French conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC: LVMUY) owns some of the most popular luxury goods brands, with more than 60 including Christian Dior, Fenty, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Bulgari, TAG Heuer and Sephora.

The company completed its acquisition of Tiffany recently, which could add to the possibility of it seeing a strong Valentine’s Day holiday.

Story continues

While the company's products are popular as gift ideas year-round, for Valentine's Day you could skip the expensive watches and perfumes from LVMH and buy stock in the conglomerate company instead.

Carnival Corp: You may not be able to take a cruise with your loved one right now, but you can buy stock in Carnival Corp (NYSE: CCL).

The company has the world’s most popular cruise line with its namesake brand. Others include Princess, Holland America Line, Seabourn, Cunard, AIDA, Costa and P&O Cruises

For Valentine’s Day, book a post-pandemic cruise with your significant other. Another thing investors could do is buy stock in Carnival Corp to anticipate the strong demand cruises could see from the continued rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and reopening plans.

Signet: One stock that always gets attention around Valentine’s Day is Signet Jewelers (NYSE: SIG). The company is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry. More than 2,800 stores are owned by Signet with brands such as Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry.

The company reported a strong holiday quarter even with macro hurdles and store closures. Holiday sales of $1.8 billion were flat to last year and same-store sales were down 4.1% in the holiday period. The key to growth was e-commerce which increased 60.8% year-over-year.

So, while purchasing your beloved some jewelry, also gift some shares of Signet to play with the growing e-commerce growth of the company.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 fastest growing tech cities in the world. According to the World Health Organization, two-thirds of the world’s population will be residing in urban cities in about 35 years. This would lead to an additional increase in the population residing in the urban cities. The demand of such an increase can only be met with the aid of cutting-edge technology. Technology will not only help with food production but also provide employment opportunities to people and a source of income. These tech cities further bring venture capital investment into the country and as a result, lead to economic prosperity and increase in standards of living.

Tech cities provide a huge benefit to their local and national economies. They help in attracting investment and skilled human resource from all over the world. Although tech cities do bring a bundle of advantages, they may also create challenges for the economies. In case of an increase in demand, the working spaces may become expensive for startups operating at a smaller scale with limited access to funds. Also, a threat of insularity may develop over time which may lead to lesser chances of external collaboration.

Government policies play a major role in the creation of tech cities. It is impossible that a city prospers in the global tech race without the intervention of its government. David Cameroon, ex-prime Minister of the UK, wanted London to be the next Silicon Valley. For this purpose, “Tech Nation” was launched by the government since their ultimate strategy was to boost technological capabilities within the UK. Similar was the ambition of the Dutch government in the Netherlands where the government focused on making favorable trade deals that would increase the technological potential of the cities like Eindhoven, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. For example, Startup Amsterdam was initiated by the Dutch Government to increase the collaboration between the city and the private companies. Through this initiative startup could seek help and expand within the same environment, thus helping the Netherlands economy grow and become one of the tech countries that promotes innovation and collaboration.

Huge tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are based in USA because of tech-friendly initiatives and policies by the government. On the other hand, the French government, under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged to make Paris the capital among all the tech nations, giving stiff competition to other European countries like Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. Paris has been home to the multi-million-pound startup, Station F, which serves as the biggest startup campus. There has been a large influx of startups moving to Paris and working at Station F. Not just small-scaled startups are using Station F’s resources and services, but also partners like Vente-Privée, HEC (NASDAQ:HEC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), L'Oréal and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN).

Berlin, arguably the world’s coolest city, is not far behind in technology and innovation. The organizational culture thrives on focusing on innovation. It is also home to one of the most successful startups, Delivery Hero, operating in more than 40+ companies and a parent company to Foodpanda, which rivals Uber Eats in certain countries. The German government introduced the Digital Hub Initiative to encourage collaboration between various startups in the digital era. The rankings and listings of the fastest-growing tech cities in the world have been compiled from London and Partners, Forbes, and Savills.

What is fascinating about the tech capital of Estonia, Tallinn, is that with an e-Residency permit, an individual can start their business in Estonia, without actually living there.

Before 2010, New York was quite far behind Silicon Valley and Boston in technology and innovation. Now it is catching up and it is catching up fast.

During 2013, there were around 7000 high tech companies operating in the city, as per the state’s office.

The People’s Republic of China has evolved into one of the richest countries of the world in just a few decades. According to data published by the World Bank in 2019, the Gross Domestic Product or GDP of China has had a sharp increase since 1990, with the number climbing almost exponentially. David Mann, global chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, commented on this rapid economic growth, stating that ""From the end of the 1970s onwards we've seen what is easily the most impressive economic miracle of any economy in history.""

This success can be accredited to a number of reasons. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, beginning the boom of Chinese goods in World trade. Research published by London School of Economics further illustrated this massive increase. By 1985, exports were $25 billion, $15 billion more than what they were 9 years ago in 1976. Just 25 years later, in 2010, exports valued at an amount of $3 trillion dollars; 300 times more than what the value was in 1985.

As trade between nations increased, so did the Chinese public’s interest in entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur is someone who participates in the act of setting up a business, while also bearing the effects of this risk in hope of a profit. A good business idea has the power to rake in millions but getting to that point where profit is being generated consistently can be a long, difficult journey. 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs

Matej Kastelic/Shutterstock.com

The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is one platform which studies entrepreneurial behavior and attitudes of several countries across the world. Data collected in 2019 for China showed that 9.33 percent of the public (ages 18-64) owned an established business. This included those who are owning and managing a running business that has paid salaries, wages, or any other payments to the owners for more than 42 months. The same platform also displayed data on the attitude of Chinese society towards entrepreneurs. Almost 80 percent of people agreed with the statement that in their country, most people consider starting a business as a desirable career choice.

All this evidence points towards the fact that in general, entrepreneurs are viewed in a quite favorable light by the Chinese public. Because of this, those entrepreneurs who have a considerable reach may have the distinct power of influencing those around them. Whether this is by inspiring the population with their success story, or by introducing a revolutionary idea through their product, Chinese entrepreneurs have affected the general public in one way or another.

For this reason, we have prepared a list of the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs. To prepare their ranking, we have used Fortune China and Forbes as our source, ranking each business leader based on not only their company’s success, but also their influence on the general public. Let us look at the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs, starting with number 12.

12. Zhang Jindong

Date of Birth: March 28, 1963 (age 57 years)

Occupation: Co-founder and Chairman of Suning

Net Worth: $62.1 billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)

The first person to grace our list of 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs is 57-year-old Zhang Jindong. Zhang is the chairman of Suning.com, one of the largest retailers in China, and is said to be among the top 3 in the Chinese e-commerce industry. Zhang has certainly come a long way from when he first started the company in 1998 as an air-conditioning store. Throughout the years, he has diverged into many markets, moving from air conditioning to home appliances to online shopping. Zhang is also the owner of a privately-held company called Suning Holdings Group, which is particularly famous for having acquired the famous Italian football club Inter Milan. In 2019, Suning.com acquired 80% of Wanda Department Store and Carrefour China, increasing the reach of his company even further. 10 Biggest Universities in the US

11. Wang Xing

Date of Birth: February 18, 1979 (41 years)

Occupation: Co-founder and CEO of Meituan

Net Worth: $30.5 billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)

With a net worth of over 30 billion, Wang Xing has achieved great monetary success at a young age. In 2010, Wang founded the company Meituan, an application which connects consumers with businesses, offering different vouchers for a variety of retail services including entertainment, dining, delivery, and travel. The business model is similar to that of the American service Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN), while Meituan itself boasts an aspiration to be the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of services. Having built Meituan to become a multi-billion dollar company, that dream doesn’t seem too far off. Meituan, formerly known as Meituan Dianping after the two companies’ merger, is not the only entrepreneurial stint of Wang. In 2005 and 2007 he created Chinese versions of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), called Xiaonei and Fanfou respectively. Although not at the level of Meituan, both websites proved to be hits for Wang, and showcased his drive for being a business leader.

The Dubai-based online streaming platform will use the funds from Ruya Partners to further strengthen the company’s geographic and customer reach as well as to acquire and produce original content, according to a statement Wednesday. The financing marks Ruya Partners’ first tech investment in the United Arab Emirates.

“Where global players and platforms meet challenges and difficulties, we see opportunity and hope,” Maaz Sheikh, chief executive office of Starzplay, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We localize the experience, we localize the content offering like no other global platform and that’s really been the key to our success.”

The number of subscribers at Starzplay currently stands at 1.8 million, with a local market share of more than 32%, after what it described as “exceptional growth” last year. Online streaming platforms around the world had an unexpected windfall in 2020 when the lockdowns prompted by the Covid-19 outbreak brought a flood of users.

Starzplay saw growth of about 40% in 2020 in its paid subscriber base and expects the number of users to double over the next three to four years to around 4 million, according to Sheikh. To be ready for an initial public offering, the company needs revenue to reach a range of $120 million to $150 million, he said.

“We remain committed to IPO plans,” he said. “We see still two or three years of growth to come and prepare ourselves in listing the business.”

In addition to the latest round of financing, Starzplay raised $125 million in equity funding since its launch in 2015 from State Street Global Advisors and STARZ, a company owned by Lionsgate Entertainment Corp.

Established last year, Ruya Partners is partly owned by Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners, which itself is formed through a joint venture between Mubadala Investment Co. and Falcon Edge Capital.

38,2021-02-01T23:20:01+00:00,"These 3 Stocks Are Top Picks for 2021, Says BMO","Usually, when markets climb to record levels and stay there, investors start thinking about bubbles. However, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital, believes that we’re just in the midst of a counter-intuitive time.

In a recent note, Belski ruminates at length on the current conditions, and investors’ guesstimates that 1H21 will see a stock bubble.

“Widespread speculation of an imminent stock market bubble, not to mention calls for a potential sharp correction in the first half of 2021, only to be followed up by strength during the second half, represents excessively consensus thought by most clients we speak with,” Belski wrote.

But here the plot thickens – Belski isn’t sure that the common wisdom has called conditions right: “We believe the first part of 2021 will be much stronger than most investors are imagining.”

Belski explains that with the Joe Biden ensconced in the White House, and supported by Democrat majorities in both Houses of Congress, a new corona response stimulus package will likely be larger than expected. Combined with vaccine programs and a solid Q4 earnings season, Belski believes that a cyclical uplift will hit the markets and extend through the year.

Against this backdrop, the stock analysts at BMO are taking their cue from Belski, and choosing their top picks for 2021. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the three alongside each other to get the lowdown on what the near-term holds for these top picks.

Tronox, Ltd.(TROX)

We will start with Tronox, a mining and specialty metal manufacturing company. Tronox mines titanium ores and zircon, which are used to produce titanium chemicals: titanium dioxide and chemical sands, primarily, which are used in dyes. Tronox products are found in paints, papers, plastics, and other common products. Useful byproducts of the manufacturing process include caustic soda, gypsum, iron sulfate, and various acid compounds.

A solid industrial niche, with essential products in a variety of sectors, gives Tronox a firm foundation for growth, and the share value reflects that. The stock rose an impressive 106% over the past 12 months.

Story continues

In Q3, the last reported, Tronox showed $675 million at the top line, up 17% sequentially. Improved market demand, and consequent improved TiO2 (titanium dioxide) sales through the quarter powered the higher revenues.

Looking ahead, Tronox has recently issued new Q4 guidance – and these preliminary numbers were far better than expected. For the last quarter of CY20, Tronox is guiding toward revenue of $783 million – which will be a 13.6% year-over-year gain.

Based on all that Tronox has going for it, BMO analyst John McNulty tells investors that his bullish thesis remains very much intact.

“We listed TROX as one of our top picks for 2021 [based on] our belief that the strength of the cycle would surprise investors in the near term on the volume side and in the intermediate term on the pricing side. The 4Q ""blowout"" supports our near-term thesis while… recent price hikes give us greater confidence in our intermediate-term thesis as well as our belief that our 2021 and 2022 estimates are solidly too low. We continue to believe TROX offers the most upside of any name in our space looking out through 2021,” McNulty commented.

Unsurprisingly, McNulty gives Tronox an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and a $23 price target. This conveys his confidence in TROX's ability to rise 36% over the next twelve months. (To watch McNulty’s track record, click here)

What does the rest of the Street think? As it turns out, 3 out of 4 analysts that have published a recent review see the stock as a Buy, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $19 average price target indicates ~13% upside potential. (See TROX stock analysis on TipRanks)

Netflix, Inc.(NFLX)

Netflix hardly needs any introduction. It's one of the famous FAANG stocks, a group of tech companies whose sheer size and rate of growth have helped to power the markets over past few years. The FAANGs include Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google – so Netflix is in good company, even if its $239 billion market cap puts it in a distant fifth place for size behind its peers.

Revenue has grown steadily in every quarter for the past two years, reaching $6.64 billion in 4Q20. That wasn’t the only good news from Q4. The company reported that it had exceeded 200 million paid subscribers in the quarter, and is now looking forward to turning cash flow positive for the first time.

On the balance sheet after Q4, Netflix has $15 billion in debt and $8.2 billion in cash on hand. As long as the company turns out hits like ‘The Queen’s Gambit’ and ‘The Midnight Sky,’ which had 68 million and 72 million viewers respectively in their first four weeks, the debt is considered sustainable.

Analyst Daniel Salmon, rated 5-stars by TipRanks, rates Netflix as Outperform (i.e. Buy) in his recent note for BMO. Salmon gives the stock a $700 price target, implying an upside of 30% for 2021. (To watch Salmon’s track record, click here)

Describing Netflix as a ‘Top Pick’ in his headline, the analyst goes on to say: “We raise our ARPU estimates driven by recent price increases, leading to higher revenue estimates [...] While the pricing increases may slow the subscriber growth somewhat, we do not anticipate similar level of churns as in 2019 and think total subs can surprise to the upside in 2021. We think there is another leg as the FCF generation becomes reality, and we continue to like the lack of antitrust/regulatory overhang versus rest of FANG.”

There are plenty of Buy ratings for Netflix amongst Salmon's colleagues – 23, in fact. With the addition of 6 Holds and 3 Sell, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at 632.90 and implies ~17% upside for the foreseeable future. (See NFLX stock analysis on TipRanks)

Corteva(CTVA)

The third stock on BMO's top picks list, Corteva, was once the agricultural unit of the chemical giant Dupont, before being spun off as an independent company in mid-2019. The company currently boasts a market cap of $30.3 billion – making it the world’s largest aggrotech company.

Corteva fuels its growth through a diverse product line, including seeds, crop protection, and digital land management, all designed to improve crop yields and acre value. Corteva’s seed lines include such staples as corn, wheat, soy, and sorghum – all of which are either eaten directly, shifted into processed foods, or used as livestock feed. Land management is essential to all aspects of farming, at all scales, from wheat farmers to dairy and meat producers.

The third calendar quarter is Corteva’s slowest, and Corteva showed year-over-year declines in earnings and revenue. At the same, the 52-cent EPS and the $1.86 billion reported revenue both beat the analyst forecasts.

Watching Corteva for BMO, Joel Jackson writes, “Our favorite idea for 2021 is CTVA… There's a strong pathway if 13-14x multiples keep rolling forward to future years as CTVA continues to penetrate deeper into seed traits… we believe 2021 could be a much stronger year for CTVA, which could deliver 20%+ EBITDA growth (we don’t believe this is fully appreciated by the Street although it’s starting to get there). CTVA’s earnings bridge for 2021E could be leaning closer to bull case scenarios as … higher crop prices provide better seed price opportunities (lower rebates), and crop protection sales fare better than expected.”

These comments support an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and Salazar’s $48 price target suggests that CTVA has room for a 18% upside in the coming year. (To watch Jackson’s track record, click here)

All in all, Corteva’s Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 8 reviews, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds. The $43.90 average price target suggests room for ~8% upside growth from the current trading price of $40.71. (See CTVA stock analysis on TipRanks)

39,2021-02-01T21:21:05+00:00,Google Shuts Down Stadia In-House Game Development,"(Bloomberg) -- Google is no longer competing with PlayStation and the Xbox, announcing Monday that it’s shutting down the division of Stadia that was dedicated to making exclusive games.

“Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Stadia vice president and general manager Phil Harrison said in a statement.

Now, rather than try to rival the video game industry’s big players, Stadia will partner with them. Harrison said the division will expand “our efforts to help game developers and publishers take advantage of our platform technology and deliver games directly to their players.” Stadia will continue to provide titles from other developers, but will no longer supplement them with its own slate of games as Google originally planned.

Stadia, which launched in November 2019, was an attempt from Alphabet Inc.’s Google to take on the video game console giants with a platform of its own. Unlike traditional consoles, Stadia allows users to play games on devices such as Android phones and Chromecast apps for TV, by funneling data directly from Google’s server clusters. The goal, Google said when it announced the service, was to reach well beyond the audience of traditional gamers and especially penetrate markets such as China and India, where many people cannot easily afford or access a pricey PlayStation from Sony Corp. or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

Gaming news site Kotaku earlier reported the reorganization, saying that about 150 people will lose their jobs as part of the plans, which include shutting offices in Montreal and Los Angeles, although Google will try to place them elsewhere. “We’re committed to working with this talented team to find new roles and support them,” Harrison said in the statement.

Story continues

Most players found that Stadia performed well, but the pricing model led to confusion. Rather than package games in a subscription service like Netflix or Xbox Game Pass, Stadia required players to buy individual titles. At launch, users also had to pay for a $130 package to get started. By many accounts the service has underperformed as a result. One former employee said Stadia’s initial sales were well below expectations. Google’s long-term strategy had been to invest in studios to develop games that could only be played on Stadia.

As part of the restructuring, veteran executive Jade Raymond, formerly of Electronic Arts Inc. and Ubisoft Entertainment SA, is leaving Google, Harrison said in the statement.

The 30-year-old character will be featured in “Sonic Prime,” a kids-and-family series from Sega of America and WildBrain, set to premiere worldwide on Netflix in 2022.

The 24-episode series features Sonic in an adventure where the fate of a strange new multiverse rests in his gloved hands — and also represents a “journey of self-discovery and redemption” for the speedy, blue spiny mammal.

“Sonic is a beloved character and holds a special place in everyone’s heart including my own,” Dominique Bazay, Netflix’s director of original animation, said in a statement. “I spent many hours with the Blue Blur as a kid and it’s a privilege to be able to bring this character everyone knows and loves on a brand new adventure with Netflix — one that a generation of loyal fans and brand new fans around the world can enjoy.”

The Netflix project comes on the heels of Paramount Pictures’ live-action “Sonic the Hedgehog” movie starring Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, James Marsden as Tom and Jim Carrey as the villainous Dr. Robotnik. The film, which premiered Aug. 21, 2020, pulled in $149 million domestically and $320 million worldwide. Sega and Paramount have announced that a sequel is in development.

The “Sonic Prime” series on Netflix will be aimed at kids aged six to 11, as well as “legacy Sonic fans of all ages.” The series for Netflix will be animated at WildBrain’s Vancouver studio, and Sega and WildBrain will jointly participate across production, distribution and licensing. Man of Action Entertainment, creators of “Ben 10” and the characters and team in Disney’s Oscar-winning feature “Big Hero 6,” are on board as showrunners and executive producers.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: At some point you applied to Harvard, though, and got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, what was the case was this. When I won the award in my very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, [INAUDIBLE].

So he had been an alumni of Harvard. And so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he got into the almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time. So I was supported through the whole application process. And was really an amazing experience.

But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this [INAUDIBLE]. So it brought in like a new dynamic in the competition, because for the first time what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing.

And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them. So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a wait on this.

And actually what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. So at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret it. I just think that there was a different path to take.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/kenyan-tech-entrepreneur-explains-why-144921570.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0P00012B2W.TO', 'AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'CSCO.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'NFLX.US', 'ORCL.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SPXL.US', 'TQQQ.US']",['HARVARD'],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.191}"

44,2021-01-22T17:43:22+00:00,It’s Time to Give GOEV Stock a Green Light,"I’ve always had a sense that to make the promise of electric vehicles (EVs) come to fruition; the industry would require a different way of thinking. That’s one reason for you to consider an investment in Canoo (NYSE:GOEV). It’s understandable if you’re just getting up to speed on Canoo. The company went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) late last year. Canoo trades under the ticker symbol GOEV stock. an electric car plugged in for charging, representing electric car stocks

Innovation is a word that gets thrown around a lot. But sometimes innovative just means different. However in the case of Canoo, the company is really doing taking an innovative approach to building an EV. That got the attention of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the company is reportedly pursuing a contract manufacturing deal with the auto parts giant Magna International (NYSE:MGA).

Not Your Mother’s Minivan

As the EV sector becomes more crowded, it’s important to have differentiation. The novel approach that Canoo takes is one reason to consider the stock. The company is entering the market with two offerings. The first is what it termed a multipurpose delivery vehicle (MPDV). Or, if you glance at the schematic, it might better be called a party bus.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day

This is because of the innovative design. As Luke Lango wrote, the basic precept with any traditionally fueled or electric vehicle designs is that they are meant to be…driven. That makes sense, right? Well the thing is we’re becoming a society where people want to get from point A to point B without worrying about that driving stuff.

Canoo’s vehicle is not there yet. But the “by wire” system being employed in the design is an essential part of the company’s “skateboard” platform. And down the road, it will be the key to providing the vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities.

The company is also looking to put this design to work in a last-mile delivery vehicle.

Story continues

A Minimal Commitment

Another reason to consider GOEV stock is the way the company plans to sell the vehicles. In fact, the word sell is not appropriate. Canoo is offering consumers a lease with virtually no commitment. Essentially the company will have an SaaS model for electric vehicles. Consumers can pick out a vehicle and lease it for a specified period of time (minimum of 30 days). After their subscription ends, they can simply return the vehicle. There’s no long-term contract. And they can return it anytime.

Yeah, it’s kinda cool. Like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) but with a car. But it’s more than that. It will afford the company with higher margins because, in theory, one vehicle will have multiple “owners” throughout its life. And that makes the company irresistible to analysts.

The Electric Vehicle Revolution is Real

The electric vehicle sector has always been an intriguing industry. But it always seemed like all the tumblers were never in place. When there was the political will, the technology was years away. In the last few years, the technology has caught up but the Trump administration had a policy of benign neglect towards the sector.

But there was a new wind blowing down Pennsylvania Avenue. That wind is blowing in an administration that has said that electric vehicles will be a key part of its agenda. This means that investors should view the sector with a little less speculation.

Buy a Little GOEV Stock Now, Buy More Later

Canoo will have no revenue for at least another year. A lot can happen between now and then so it’s not fair to say nothing can go wrong. We all know that things can go awry. And since prudence is a good virtue to have, I recommend prudence with GOEV stock. Now would be a good time to take a small position on the stock. The stock is just starting to move higher, but will likely have some volatility as the lockup period ends.

What Happened: Hastings, who co-founded Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), continued his superstitious practice of celebrating company milestones with a meal from Denny’s Corp (NASDAQ: DENN).

Hastings had a meal from Denny’s delivered, which prompted a tweet from Denny’s asking: “you and us and chill?”

At 200m, Rich, it was Denny's on Demand at home. pic.twitter.com/VKgr3qJ0So

— Reed Hastings (@reedhastings) January 20, 2021

In 2017, Hastings shared in a Facebook post that he celebrated the 100-million subscriber mark for the company with a Denny’s meal to keep a tradition, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The CEO and co-founder ate a steak dinner alone at Denny’s to celebrate the milestone.

“Celebrating 100 million members the same way I did 1m, a steak alone at Denny’s. #Superstitious,” the post from Hastings said.

Why It’s Important: Netflix reported 203.66 million global subscribers at the end of the fourth quarter. This figure was up 21.9% year-over-year and came in ahead of consensus estimates.

The company saw record viewership in December and during the week of Dec. 25-31. Netflix said it broke records for total hours viewed and average hours viewed per subscriber during the last week of December.

New hits like “Bridgerton” and “We Can Be Heroes” helped power the streaming service's strong month.

With continued hit original programming and growing subscriber figures, the question could now turn to when Hastings will buy a Denny's steak dinner to celebrate 300 million subscribers.

46,2021-01-21T15:12:03+00:00,"Stock Market News for Jan 21, 2021","Wall Street closed sharply higher on Wednesday as Joe Biden took the charge of 46th U.S. President. Expectations of higher fiscal stimulus and strong fourth quarter 2020 earnings results bolstered market participants' confidence. All the three major stock indexes ended in the green.

How Did The Benchmarks Perform?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) surged 0.8% or 257.86 points to close at 31,188.38, marking its all-time closing high. Notably, 22 components of the 30-stock index ended in the green while 8 in red. The blue-chip index also recorded all-time intraday high at 31,235.98.

The Nasdaq Composite finished at 13,457.25, appreciating 2% or 260.07 points due to strong performance by large-cap tech stocks. This was the tech-heavy index's all-time high closing. During intraday trading, the tech-laden index recorded an all-time high at 13,486.13.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 advanced  1.4% to end at 3,851.85, reflecting its all-time closing high. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), the Communication  Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) climbed 2.1%, 3.1% and 2%, respectively. Notably, ten out of eleven sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green and one in red. During intraday trading, the broad-market index recorded an all-time high at 3,859.75.

According to Dow Jones Market Data, both the Dow and the S&P 500 posted their best Presidential Inauguration Day gains since Ronald Reagan took the oath of office for his second term in 1985. Moreover, the Nasdaq Composite registered the best Presidential Inauguration Day rally on record.

The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 7.1% to 21.58. A total of 13.66 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 12.83 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.02-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.

Markets Wait for Higher Stimulus

Story continues

On Jan 14, President Joe Biden proposed a  new $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid package called “American Rescue Plan”. The proposed plan will include increasing direct payments to $2,000 from existing $600 and supplemental unemployment benefits to $400 per week through September. Minimum wage rate to be hiked to $15 per hour and moratoriums on eviction and foreclosure on mortgages to be extended to Sep 30.

The plan will include $20 billion for a national vaccination program, $50 billion for COVID testing, and $350 billion aid to state and local governments. In addition, the plan will provide $130 billion for reopening of schools, $35 billion for higher education and $5 billion for a “Hardest Hit Education Fund.”

Notably, on Jan 19, Janet Yellen, Biden’s designated nominee for Treasury Secretary, endorsed higher aid spending.

Strong Fourth-Quarter 2020 Earnings Results

Shares of Netflix Inc. NFLX soared 16.9% after the company reported that it added 8.5 million paid subscribers globally in the last quarter compared with the consensus estimate of 6.5 million. The service surpassed 200 million paid subscribers for the first time in the last quarter.

47,2021-01-21T14:15:02+00:00,New Highs on Hopes that New President Brings New Stimulus,"The major indices all reached record highs on Wednesday as a new President gets inaugurated and Netflix soars double digits.

As far as the market is concerned, it might as well have been a big dollar sign taking the oath this afternoon. President Biden already outlined a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, but he's probably not done. More relief is expected in the near future, as evidenced by Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen’s “go big” comments yesterday in front of a Senate committee.

 The NASDAQ once again was easily out in front with a surge of 1.97% (or approximately 260 points) to 13,457.25.

 The index got a lot of help from Netflix (NFLX), which soared just about 16.9% in the session after its quarterly report. The streaming giant’s top and bottom line results didn’t really impress investors, but the growth in global subscriptions sure did.

 NFLX added 8.5 million new customers, which soared past expectations of less than 7 million. It now has more than 200 million subscribers The company is also thinking about stock buybacks.

 Meanwhile, the S&P rose 1.39% on Wednesday to 3851.85, while the Dow advanced 0.83% (or about 258 points) to 31,188.38.

 This is the first time all three major indices reached new highs at the same time since Friday, January 8.

 Morgan Stanley (MS) continued its industry’s pattern this earnings season by reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue… but getting little love from the market. However, the stock only dipped by 0.2%.

 It’s still early in the season, but we’ve had a pretty strong start with a very high proportion of companies beating estimates and even offering favorable outlooks. For an in-depth study of the season so far, make sure to read Sheraz Mian’s recent Earnings Trends report titled: “Early Q4 Results Show an Improving Earnings Picture”.

 In addition to the next round  of reports and any first moves by the new Administration, investors will also be watching the jobless claims report tomorrow.

 You certainly remember that last week’s was particularly rough with approximately 965,000 people filing claims, which blew the doors off expectations of 800K.

 Unfortunately, tomorrow’s number isn’t expected to be much better, though it might not matter to the market since investors are looking forward right now.

Today's Portfolio Highlights:

Blockchain Innovators: News of a 2-for-1 stock split sent eXp World Holdings (EXPI) surging nearly 16% on Wednesday. Dave added this cloud-based real estate business back in March during the early days of the economic shutdown. The stock has now soared nearly 1000% since being added. Yeah, you read that right. In less than a year, EXPI has turned into a 1000% winner for the portfolio!  The editor certainly thought a company like this would perform well during the pandemic, but this is ridiculous… in a great and very profitable way. Needless to say, the rally in EXPI today gave this portfolio one of the top performers among all ZU names. 

Home Run Investor: With a full portfolio, Brian must cut a name in order to add a new one. Therefore, he sold Altra Industrial Motion (AIMC) on Wednesday for a nice return of 22.2%. in approximately two-and-a-half months. The new addition is Verra Mobility Corp. (VRRM), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) from the security and safety services sector. The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 49%. The pandemic impacted VRRM’s topline in 2020, but analysts are calling for growth of 33% in 2021. The complete commentary has more specifics on today’s addition. 

Surprise Trader: Data protection has become increasingly more important in this “stay home” economy. Therefore, Dave added CommVault Systems (CVLT) on Wednesday with a 12.5% allocation. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.6% last time and as much as 168.4% the quarter before. CVLT will look to make it three in a row before the bell on Wednesday, January 27. It has a positive Earnings ESP of 4.71% for the report, so there's a good chance it can keep the momentum going. Unfortunately, that’s not the case for Goldman Sachs (GS), which is “stuck in the mud” despite what Dave considered to be a “great report”. He sold GS for a loss of about 3.7%. Read the complete commentary for more on today’s action. 

Counterstrike: As previously mentioned, shares of eXp World Holdings (EXPI) soared on Wednesday after this cloud-based real estate broker service announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Jeremy reminds us that such a split does not make a stock more valuable, but the market loves them nonetheless. The editor considers the upmove to be “silly”, but the profits are not. The portfolio sold EXPI today for a nice return of 28.6% in less than two weeks. You’ve got to take what the market gives you!

TAZR Trader: Leave it to Kevin to find some rare value in the tech space. Of course, he had to go “across the pond” to find it. On Wednesday, the editor added Talend (TLND), a provider of big data and cloud integration solutions. He’s most impressed with the company’s cloud revenue, which has been doubling (yoy) for 14 straight quarters and will breach $100 million for 2020. Furthermore, it’s 4X price/sales multiple is a bargain compared to peers like Splunk (SPLK, 10X), Alteryx (AYX, 15X), Elastic (ESTC, 20X) and MongoDB (MDB, 30X). The portfolio added TLND with a 7% allocation. Read the full write-up for more.

 Have a Great Evening,

48,2021-01-21T12:13:12+00:00,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Netflix, Knowles Corp, Silicon Motion Technology, Himax Technologies and Sensata Technologies","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – January 21, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Knowles Corporation KN, Silicon Motion Technology Corporation SIMO, Himax Technologies, Inc. HIMX and Sensata Technologies Holding plc ST.

Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:

Risk/Reward Skewed for Netflix; Buy These Tech Stocks Instead

Netflix reported fourth quarter revenue that beat expectations by a sliver and earnings that missed by a mile. But the reason investors still cheered was the number of net subscriber adds that at 8.5 million were well ahead of the 6 million that many on Wall Street were expecting.

And it was particularly creditable given the strong first half and management’s own expectations about pull-ins into the first half, as people suddenly found themselves at home with a lot of time on their hands.

Also encouraging was the continued improvement in average revenue per membership on a currency-neutral basis.

But even as we continue to cheer the 200 million total subscriber mark that it hit at 2020-end, it’s important to note that Disney+ is already almost halfway there, in spite of being a much newer offering.

Also in contention for streaming market share is Warner’s HBO Max, which like Disney, has a ton of stuff to offer. With a recent change in its streaming plans, Warner is upping the ante in the space, which could help it take share from Netflix, which also has a broad spread lined up. Amazon Prime is also worth adding to the mix, because it has a pretty good service, offering both acquired and original content that is also bundled for free with its hugely popular Prime membership. And then there’s Apple that has just about started testing the waters.

Story continues

Netflix shares have traded in a tight range over the past six months, partly because of management’s cautious tone about new subscriber adds. So they really aren’t expensive right now. However, you only have that many hours of free time per day in which to watch these shows, especially if you’re getting back into the normal work stream as is envisaged for this year. So increased competition this year feels like something to keep an eye on.

In any case, there are many other stocks that you could add more profitably perhaps at this time. The earnings season is in fact a good time to adjust positions and also make some quick gains.

At Zacks, we have the Earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP), which is a proprietary tool that determines the stocks that have the best chances of reporting a positive surprise with their next earnings announcement. ESP is essentially the percentage difference between the most accurate (or most recent) estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. So a positive ESP indicates recent upward revision in estimates, which one can reasonably assume is because of positive developments regarding the stock.

And it has also been seen that stocks reporting a positive surprise have greater chances of appreciating either immediately, or over the next few months.

This means that if we can devote a certain amount of our available funds to stocks with a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) rating that also have a positive earnings ESP, there’s a fair chance of making some gains within a reasonably short period of time.

So here, I’ve chosen a few stocks from the tech sector that have a buy rating and positive ESP-

Knowles Corp. sells MEMS-based products including advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing and precision device solutions into the mobile consumer electronics, IoT, communications, medical, defense, automotive and industrial markets.

It belongs to the Communication – Components industry, which is in the top 32% of Zacks-classified industries. The top 50% outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1. Moreover, it has also been seen that half the price appreciation in a stock is attributable to the industry that it's in.

It is expected to grow revenue and earnings by 14.2% and 104.2%, respectively in 2021.

The shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 and earnings ESP of 5.6%. So there is a good chance of an earnings beat this quarter, followed by a bump-up in share prices.

Silicon Motion Technology Corp. offers microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices.

It belongs to the Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which is in the top 40% of Zacks-classified industries.

It is expected to grow revenue and earnings by a respective 11.0% and 6.9% this year.

The shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 and earnings ESP of 2.0%.

Himax Technologies develops and sells semiconductors used in large-size TFT-LCD panels for desktop monitors, notebook computers and TV application, as well as mid-size TFT-LCD panels for mobile handsets and consumer electronics products such as digital cameras, mobile gaming devices and car navigation displays. More recently, it started adding LCD TV chipsets and LCOS microdisplays.

It too is part of the Electronics – Semiconductors industry.

Its 2021 revenue and earnings are expected to grow 20.7% and 62.5%, respectively.

The shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 and earnings ESP of 14.3%.

Sensata Technologies Holding develops and sells innovative sensor-based personalized electrical protection and power management solutions from automotive braking systems to aircraft flight controls. Its products are ubiquitously used in industrial, heavy vehicle and off-road, as well as aerospace industries.

The company belongs to the Instruments – Control industry (top 41%).

Its revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 15.9% and 52.2% this year.

The shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 and earnings ESP of 2.78%.

49,2021-01-20T18:02:06+00:00,Risk/Reward Skewed for Netflix; Buy These 5 Tech Stocks Instead,"Netflix NFLX reported fourth quarter revenue that beat expectations by a sliver and earnings that missed by a mile. But the reason investors still cheered was the number of net subscriber adds that at 8.5 million were well ahead of the 6 million that many on Wall Street were expecting.

And it was particularly creditable given the strong first half and management’s own expectations about pull-ins into the first half, as people suddenly found themselves at home with a lot of time on their hands.

Also encouraging was the continued improvement in average revenue per membership on a currency-neutral basis.

But even as we continue to cheer the 200 million total subscriber mark that it hit at 2020-end, it’s important to note that Disney+ is already almost halfway there, in spite of being a much newer offering.

Also in contention for streaming market share is Warner’s HBO Max, which like Disney, has a ton of stuff to offer. With a recent change in its streaming plans, Warner is upping the ante in the space, which could help it take share from Netflix, which also has a broad spread lined up. Amazon Prime is also worth adding to the mix, because it has a pretty good service, offering both acquired and original content that is also bundled for free with its hugely popular Prime membership. And then there’s Apple that has just about started testing the waters.

Netflix shares have traded in a tight range over the past six months, partly because of management’s cautious tone about new subscriber adds. So they really aren’t expensive right now. However, you only have that many hours of free time per day in which to watch these shows, especially if you’re getting back into the normal work stream as is envisaged for this year. So increased competition this year feels like something to keep an eye on.

In any case, there are many other stocks that you could add more profitably perhaps at this time. The earnings season is in fact a good time to adjust positions and also make some quick gains.

At Zacks, we have the Earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP), which is a proprietary tool that determines the stocks that have the best chances of reporting a positive surprise with their next earnings announcement. ESP is essentially the percentage difference between the most accurate (or most recent) estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. So a positive ESP indicates recent upward revision in estimates, which one can reasonably assume is because of positive developments regarding the stock.

And it has also been seen that stocks reporting a positive surprise have greater chances of appreciating either immediately, or over the next few months.

This means that if we can devote a certain amount of our available funds to stocks with a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) rating that also have a positive earnings ESP, there’s a fair chance of making some gains within a reasonably short period of time.

So here, I’ve chosen a few stocks from the tech sector that have a buy rating and positive ESP-

Video Transcript

- You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it, I was on the board at the time of DirecTV, they bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion. So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem, that we have [? won, ?] by the way.

So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner, or the Warner, I should say, content that they bought I think was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

- And then Fox and Disney.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big.

So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized you need more scale both at the content and as well as the distribution level. So when he identified the fact that there wasn't much for him to buy to, and again, this is my humble opinion, and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. He's doing all right.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/haim-saban-explains-why-fox-142106581.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'CCERX.US', 'CMCSA.US', 'DIS.US', 'FB.US', 'FOX.US', 'FOXA.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IWM.US', 'NFLX.US', 'SBGI.US', 'SNAP.US', 'SPY.US', 'T-PA.US', 'T-PC.US', 'T.US', 'TMUS.US', 'TPCO.US', 'TWTR.US']","['DISNEY', 'TIME WARNER']","{'polarity': 0.978, 'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.099}"
56,2021-01-15T14:12:06+00:00,Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan could wreck Wall Street's favorite money-making trade,"President-elect Joe Biden’s extensive $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may supercharge economic growth, but also send Wall Street’s favorite five tech stocks known as FAANG into a short-term price slumber.

While naturally Biden’s fiscal relief won’t be causing quarterly earnings misses at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google, his plan could dent market psychology on the stocks and in turn what multiple investors are willing to pay on each.

The line of thinking is rather straightforward to astute market watchers.

Biden’s stimulus package could send investors rushing into more cyclical stocks in the retail, energy and materials space in advance of strong lifts to the respective sector earnings growth rates. Those funds may come from cashing out of FAANG stocks, which gained an average 43% (versus a 27% rise in the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund) over the past year fueled by views on the Street of Big Tech being economic safe havens.

Interestingly, this dynamic may already be playing out. Shares of the FAANG stocks are all slightly lower (Netflix the worst performer, is down 6.1%) year-to-date compared to the 1.1% gain for the S&P 500.

Supporting the possible rotation would be Wall Street analysts moving quickly to push up profit estimates on cyclical areas of the market. Looked at another way, investors would be positioning for faster earnings growth this year and next out of cyclicals relative to FAANG stocks because of the latest stimulus package.

“The spending comes at an interesting junction for analysts and investors as it will no doubt mean further EPS upgrades. It will also mean that many early cycle S&P 500 sectors will see faster earnings revisions than the popular FAANG+ and IT which dominated investor attention in 2020,” points out Jefferies strategist Sean Darby.

Not even 24-hours after Biden released his economic revival plan, Wall Street has already laid the groundwork for the unwind of the FAANG long trade.

Story continues

Darby says his economic team at Jefferies lifted its 2021 U.S. GDP target to 6.4% from 5.25% after the release of Biden’s proposal. Jefferies analysts also raised their price targets and EPS estimates on their industrial coverage, Darby says.

The immediate tone is similar at Goldman Sachs.

“We do not expect all of the elements of the proposal to pass, but we are increasing our assumption of additional near-term fiscal measures from $750 billion (3.4% of GDP) to $1.1 trillion (5% of GDP),” Goldman’s Chief Economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a flash note to clients.

Not everyone on the Street is ready to toss in the towel on FAANG stocks, however.

Bulls argue that with the pandemic continuing to rage on and putting the economic recovery at risk no matter of a fresh stimulus injection, FAANG remains the best place to be. Companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google offer strong business models and growth prospects for the foreseeable future — and any dips in their stock prices should be bought, say the bulls.

“The FAANG names all have Josh Allen-like [Buffalo Bills quarterback] tailwinds, Biden is just evening the playing field for industrial, manufacturing, and small businesses on the other side of this dark chapter of growth,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says. “We view Biden plan as bullish for the market and our view is tech stocks still have another 25%+ upside for 2021.”

No doubt though the winds are starting to blow in the direction of the cyclical on the FAANG off-trade.

ANDY SERWER: Tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, ""Oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.""

HAIM SABAN: I say baloney. You know, he's-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters maybe he's a little bit left of me. But he's more of a centrist than a left wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who was able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal. And I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again there are so many avenues that you can take to address that inequality. But I am truly, in my heart of hearts 100% convinced that he's the right man to address that inequality.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Instead of shrinking from the world after he made his billions, media mogul Haim Saban jumped into the fray. The Democratic mega-donor has poured tens of millions into electing the party's candidates, becoming a top power broker with a special focus on policy towards Israel. Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the global kids sensation ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" which led to lucrative partnerships with Rupert Murdoch at News Corporation. Now, Saban runs the investment firm Saban Capital Group, with holdings in music, film, and real estate. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" he joins me to talk about the corporate backlash against Donald Trump, what to expect from Joe Biden's first days in office, and why the Fox-Disney merger left him scratching his head.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm Saban Capital. Hi, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week, with regard to the attack on the Capitol. Do you think that President Trump is, in some way, to blame for the siege on the Capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is in some way. In every single way he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been-- fomented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the Capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime, and he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone. That's what I believe. But apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason-- no rhyme or reason-- to have somebody who committed a crime-- to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the election, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they caught him off, like all the online entities cut him off-- Facebook and Twitter-- if-- outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media-- television media-- simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans, from birther all the way to inciting this group of Meshuganas to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuganas is Yiddish for crazy people?

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshugana is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so-- because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always have been divisions but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence, the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about-- they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OANN and the telcos, as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say, Congress people-- who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion. My opinion, you should go all the way, but my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point, Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of the, as I call them, the meshuganas, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and maybe a website here and a website there-- you cannot block everything on the internet-- but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult-- possible, very difficult.

ANDY SERWER: So Biden has a lot of things on his plate, though, Haim. He's got potentially holding Trump accountable. Obviously, the main story should be COVID, right? And then there's the business of confirming cabinet members. What should he prioritize?

HAIM SABAN: COVID, obviously, the economy, support for people who can't put food on the table. And as he said, he's going to do that. You know, he's-- he was very clear that he's going to do that. And knowing him well, he's a man with a heart. He's not interested in Biden. He's interested in the country, unlike Trump, who's only interested in Trump. Nothing else interests Trump but Trump, as he has proven over and over again.

So you know, he's going to have quite a few issues on his hand, whether it's Russia or China. That's on the international platform. And obviously, domestically, we all know what the issues are. So yeah, he's got a plateful, no question.

ANDY SERWER: Do you support the idea of giving Americans $2,000 checks as part of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package?

HAIM SABAN: Above my pay grade to, you know, quote an amount because I don't have, obviously, the full picture of the deficit level, how much more money can the government keep printing or not. So I don't have a full picture. But I'm fully supportive, in principle, for the government to do the maximum to help the people that need help. In principle, I am 100%, whether it's $2,000 or $1,500 or whatever that number is. It really is above my pay grade.

ANDY SERWER: Haim, tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.

HAIM SABAN: I say, baloney. You know, he's-- they say-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously, from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters, maybe he's a little bit left of me, but he's more of a centrist than a left-wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who is able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal, and I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again, there are so many avenues that he can take to address that inequality, but I am truly, in my heart of heart, 100% convinced that he is the right man to address that inequality. He's a guy with a heart. We missed heart over the last four years. We were all served by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us, one way or the other.

ANDY SERWER: You did say you disagreed with him on some things. What were those kind of areas?

HAIM SABAN: You know, I'm a security hawk. For example, I'm not sure that telling the Iranians publicly that he plans on going back to the deal before-- behind the scenes, letting them know what the conditions are to go back to the deal and, you know, offer some carrots in public and sticks privately. I don't think that there have been discussions directly with the Iranians.

Case in point, they're now, you know, increasing the amount of uranium that they have. They're increasing the level at which it's-- so we're seeing the Iranians, basically, despite all the rhetoric by Trump, doing whatever it is they want to do, and they don't give a hoot about what Trump, you know, puts on sanctions on them. Look at the disaster of results he got out of the deal, but look at the test of results. We're a lot worse off than we were before he got out of the deal.

So the bottom line is that I think that there should have been a different approach to Iran. Yes, of course, we all believe that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian problem, whether it's ballistic missiles or, you know, the uranium development, et cetera-- you know, all of these are a main issues. But the way they just-- out of the box, this new administration has said we want to go back to the deal, that's a little worrisome. What kind of a signal are you sending?

ANDY SERWER: Right. The president, as you said, certainly has his hands full on the foreign policy front, as well. I noticed that Kim Jong Un was rattling around and making some noise. And of course, he's still there running North Korea so no shortage of things for the President-elect to have to be concerned about there.

HAIM SABAN: No question.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Haim, and ask you about Saban Capital Group, which includes a company focused on acquiring and distributing feature films and another on music production. Talk about what the business has been like during COVID, and what do you expect during 2021?

HAIM SABAN: Well, traditional media, where we invested our monies over the last 20 years-- we're not a fund. We work with our own money. And we've invested in things like Univision. We bought the largest media company in Germany. We bought the incumbent telecom company and Israel, bought and then sold, and the same thing for Germany. Traditional media is no longer, in our view, an opportunity for private equity.

So we have switched our focus to real estate. We're a big-- well, everything is relative, obviously-- but, you know, we're a multibillion-dollar holder of real estate assets. We have switched our efforts to things like acquiring finished films and distributing them, primarily in the US and the UK.

And music is my first love. I started off playing in a band then I was a producer and an agent and manager. And I'm having a lot of fun with it. I love Latin music. Latin music is exploding. So I love working in the studio. Believe it or not, I go to the studio and work with the producers and the writers and the singers, and it's been a lot of fun.

We launched, about a year ago, our first record. We already have, between our four artists, more than 1 billion streams across different platforms. So we're on our way to have a successful music company. And for me, to listen to music at home and come up with ideas for the artists to implement and share it with them, et cetera, it's been a lot of fun. I love it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I noticed you got your start in music, and I want to ask you about that. I mean, first of all, I think you had a principal who told you you weren't a good student. You self-described yourself as not a terribly good musician. And yet, you've been so successful. So I'm wondering, what is your core competency? You know, what is Haim Saban really good at?

HAIM SABAN: Nothing and everything. Because really good is a very committing statement. So really good? Nothing. Pretty good-- you know, instinct this is a very important trait. And I have been blessed to-- don't get me wrong. I've made plenty of mistakes and made investments that didn't necessarily pan out as I was planning to. On balance, everything is great, but there have been mistakes along the way. And my instincts, in most cases, have served me well and in some cases, not so well. So--

ANDY SERWER: Right. Now, I noticed you have that guitar behind you. Is there any way you could play us a tune?

HAIM SABAN: There is no way because I think you mentioned before that I admitted to being a lousy musician. So I don't want to-- I am. But being a lousy musician, you can still be a great producer, by the way. And the millions of records I have sold as a producer, when I lived in France, is proof to the fact that I knew what I was doing. And you know, the beginning of the success that we're having here with our music company, which is one year old, you know, is proof that, you know, I have a sense of what people want to listen to.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, sort of like you don't have to be the best baseball player to be the best baseball manager.

HAIM SABAN: That's a very good analogy, absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And so just one more thing about this guitar playing on your part, what do you like to play? If you're not going to play it for us, then what do you like to play, what kind of music?

HAIM SABAN: I love all kinds of music. I love all kinds of music. My playlists include everything from classic to Israeli music, classic Israeli music, modern Israeli music, Latin music, pop. I admit that I don't understand hip-hop, so I don't listen to it because I just-- I can't get my arms around hip-hop. I just don't know what's good, what's not good, and there's nothing about hip-hop that's appealing to me, at please. But overall, any kind of music, you know, that pleases my ear pleases my soul. So that's how it works.

ANDY SERWER: Right. And let me ask you, is streaming helping or hurting right now? I mean, eventually, your acts would have to perform live at some point again, right?

HAIM SABAN: Well, realistically speaking, the numbers speak for themselves. 27% of revenue for artists come from streaming, unless you're a phenomenon like Drake or J Balvin. 27% comes from streaming, 63% from all other sources-- touring, merchandising, branding, and the like. And the 63% has been frozen.

But we all hope that with the vaccine, whether it takes another six months or another 12 months-- I don't think anybody has a true sense to put a date on it-- but it will come back. It will come back. And once it comes back, that 63% of sources of revenue will be back on the table, so yeah.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned real estate, which is curious to me because a lot of people would say, wow, that's not a good business to be in right now because of COVID. What's your thesis there?

HAIM SABAN: Well, there-- we are in a-- we don't develop anything. We buy yield, if you will. And we are in categories that have been COVID resistant-- GSA, which is government, as a tenant, self-storage, student housing, you know, manufactured housing. So I am, you know, very sorry for all those that have suffered from COVID in the real estate area, but we have been very fortunate to have been minimally affected-- minimally.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned Univision, of course, which is a deal and a company that you're known for. Where does that stand? You wound that investment up, correct?

HAIM SABAN: Well, we just sold it. We just sold it.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

HAIM SABAN: That was not a shining moment in my investment career, I must admit, because we have been, you know, suffering what all traditional media has suffered. Linear television, according to Bob Iger, the Disney chairman, in 10 years, will not exist. So very few people say, OK, it's Thursday, 9:00 PM. Let's turn on CBS and watch this show. That's not how people watch TV these days. So so many people don't-- especially in the younger generation, don't even have cable or satellite.

So traditional media, we have been one of the victims of the gradual erosion of traditional media. So hey, you win some, you lose some, right? So--

ANDY SERWER: It was--

HAIM SABAN: But if, on balance, you win, you're good.

ANDY SERWER: That-- yes. It was hard to see that coming, I guess. Is there anything you look back on now and realize you could have done differently with that deal?

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, I could have taken my money and put it in an index, and it would have tripled and I wouldn't have had to work that hard for 14 years. So but, you know, who would have known, 14 years ago, that, you know, traditional media would be where it is today?

ANDY SERWER: Well, I think it's great that you can laugh about it because some people would just say, I don't want to talk about it. So the fact that you've sort of processed it and let it go, to an extent, I think is a healthy thing.

HAIM SABAN: No, I let it go. I let it go. I mean, you know, it is what it is. What's important is on balance, what's our investment performance overall. That's more important, in my opinion, than any one specific deal. No one has nothing but wins-- no one, not Warren Buffett, not Bill Gates. No one has nothing but wins. You win some, you lose some, and that's OK.

ANDY SERWER: Only Bernie Madoff had nothing but wins.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: That should have made people suspicious.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, well, exactly. Thank God we didn't have a Donald with him.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Big tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, have been getting into original content, Haim. Do you think they'll succeed?

HAIM SABAN: If they decide, as a matter of a strategic, you know, goal, they'll have no problem because they have all the money in the world to buy the biggest talent in America. And by definition, when you're able to work with the biggest talent, you're going to have a huge success.

So yeah, eventually, yeah, it's just a matter of a strategic decision for the Apple of this world to say, OK, I'm going to be bigger than any other studio. OK, and I have $250 billion in the bank, and I generate billions of dollars of free cash flow. I'm going to do it. And they do it. So I think that it's only a matter of strategic decision for them.

ANDY SERWER: Another thing you're known for is ""Power Rangers,"" and so that brings me to ask you, what do you think future trends look like in the media business, both in terms of content, maybe, and in terms of distribution? How are you seeing things?

HAIM SABAN: Well, I'll speak to the kids business, and the kids business will always be there because every year, new kids are born. And interestingly enough, during this COVID time, companies like Mattel and Hasbro are doing really well. Their sales are up by double digits.

So I think that the toy business is not going away. Entertainment for kids is not going away. We have many more platforms than we used to have, obviously. Take one example of a show called ""Cocomelon,"" which has tens of millions of followers on YouTube.

And so I think that the kids business is going to continue flourishing, again, as I said, for the simple reason that new kids are born every year. So it's a no-brainer.

ANDY SERWER: When you have your content on YouTube, though, can you monetize that? Or are you just helping out Sundar Pichai over at Google to get rich?

HAIM SABAN: Sundar Pichai gets less rich than Sergey Brin and-- what's the name of the other one?

ANDY SERWER: Larry Page.

HAIM SABAN: And Larry Page. Yeah, they get richer than Sundar. He gets plenty rich, but they-- of course you monetize it. A show like ""Cocomelon,"" I am sure, has, you know, very broad merchandising campaigns everywhere. And they sell toys, and they can go on live shows, once live shows come back.

YouTube delivers significant exposure. They're pretty stingy about how they share their revenues with creators, but there's still quite a bit of money, if you're very successful on YouTube. And then all the ancillaries are there, so they absolutely-- shows like ""Cocomelon"" are making a lot of money.

ANDY SERWER: You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it-- I used-- I was on the board at the time of DirecTV. They bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion.

ANDY SERWER: Nice.

HAIM SABAN: So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem that we have worldwide, by the way. So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner-- or the Warner, I should say--

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

HAIM SABAN: --content that they bought, I think, was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

ANDY SERWER: And then Fox and Disney?

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized, it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big. So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized, you need more scale, both at the content and-- as well as the distribution level.

So when he identified the fact that, you know, there wasn't much for him to buy to-- and again, this is my humble opinion-- and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. Rupert is doing all right.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, last question, Haim, this show is called ""Influencers,"" and so I'm curious how you see using your influence on the world.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that is-- how can I-- well, first of all, I might have some influence outside of my household. When I walk back into my household, it's-- as Jackie Mason likes to say, I say, where should I put my jacket? You know, I don't have that much influence.

So on the world, I think that people who have been as fortunate as I have been just simply need to give back. This is how you can-- you know, identify weak points in society that you feel you can be helpful with, and just give back. There's no better feeling than the feeling of giving back. There is no more gratifying feeling than the feeling of giving back. And that's what my wife and I have been doing now for-- I don't know-- 30 years is just giving back to society.

There are some specific causes that are of interest to us. Like health and battered women are of great interest to my wife, the rape center and so on and so forth, the free clinic that carries our name. We are very, very sensitive to people's suffering, and we try to do our part.

ANDY SERWER: Well, best of luck to you on that front and in all your endeavors. Haim Saban, chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, thank you so much for joining us today.

HAIM SABAN: Thank you very much.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Instead of shrinking from the world after he made his billions, media mogul Haim Saban jumped into the fray. The Democratic mega-donor has poured tens of millions into electing the party's candidates, becoming a top power broker with a special focus on policy towards Israel. Saban rose to prominence in the 1990s with the global kids sensation ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"" which led to lucrative partnerships with Rupert Murdoch at News Corporation. Now, Saban runs the investment firm Saban Capital Group, with holdings in music, film, and real estate. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" he joins me to talk about the corporate backlash against Donald Trump, what to expect from Joe Biden's first days in office, and why the Fox-Disney merger left him scratching his head.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm Saban Capital. Hi, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week, with regard to the attack on the Capitol. Do you think that President Trump is, in some way, to blame for the siege on the Capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is in some way. In every single way he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been-- fomented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the Capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime, and he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone. That's what I believe. But apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason-- no rhyme or reason-- to have somebody who committed a crime-- to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the election, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they caught him off, like all the online entities cut him off-- Facebook and Twitter-- if-- outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media-- television media-- simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans, from birther all the way to inciting this group of Meshuganas to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuganas is Yiddish for crazy people?

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshugana is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so-- because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always have been divisions but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence, the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about-- they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OANN and the telcos, as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say, Congress people-- who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion. My opinion, you should go all the way, but my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point, Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of the, as I call them, the meshuganas, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and maybe a website here and a website there-- you cannot block everything on the internet-- but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult-- possible, very difficult.

ANDY SERWER: So Biden has a lot of things on his plate, though, Haim. He's got potentially holding Trump accountable. Obviously, the main story should be COVID, right? And then there's the business of confirming cabinet members. What should he prioritize?

HAIM SABAN: COVID, obviously, the economy, support for people who can't put food on the table. And as he said, he's going to do that. You know, he's-- he was very clear that he's going to do that. And knowing him well, he's a man with a heart. He's not interested in Biden. He's interested in the country, unlike Trump, who's only interested in Trump. Nothing else interests Trump but Trump, as he has proven over and over again.

So you know, he's going to have quite a few issues on his hand, whether it's Russia or China. That's on the international platform. And obviously, domestically, we all know what the issues are. So yeah, he's got a plateful, no question.

ANDY SERWER: Do you support the idea of giving Americans $2,000 checks as part of a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package?

HAIM SABAN: Above my pay grade to, you know, quote an amount because I don't have, obviously, the full picture of the deficit level, how much more money can the government keep printing or not. So I don't have a full picture. But I'm fully supportive, in principle, for the government to do the maximum to help the people that need help. In principle, I am 100%, whether it's $2,000 or $1,500 or whatever that number is. It really is above my pay grade.

ANDY SERWER: Haim, tell us about how you met President-elect Biden, what you think of him, and how you would respond to people who say, oh, he's a career politician. He's not going to be able to solve any problems.

HAIM SABAN: I say, baloney. You know, he's-- they say-- I've known, you know, President-elect Biden for many, many years. Obviously, from his days in the Senate, I was supportive of him. On some matters, maybe he's a little bit left of me, but he's more of a centrist than a left-wing part of the Democratic Party. And I am absolutely confident that, you know, it was time for us to have somebody with Washington experience in order to get things done, somebody who is able to reach across the aisle, somebody who understands how Congress works. So from that point of view, I think that, you know, President-elect Biden is the right man at the right time in the right place.

ANDY SERWER: And research from the UN and elsewhere has suggested that rising inequality has weakened democracies around the world. Does what happened last week at the Capitol make you think about how unequal the US economy has been?

HAIM SABAN: It is unequal, and I think that President Biden recognizes that-- President-elect, President Biden on the 20th. President-elect Biden recognizes that and plans to address it. You know, again, there are so many avenues that he can take to address that inequality, but I am truly, in my heart of heart, 100% convinced that he is the right man to address that inequality. He's a guy with a heart. We missed heart over the last four years. We were all served by cynicism and division. It's time to put this behind us, one way or the other.

ANDY SERWER: You did say you disagreed with him on some things. What were those kind of areas?

HAIM SABAN: You know, I'm a security hawk. For example, I'm not sure that telling the Iranians publicly that he plans on going back to the deal before-- behind the scenes, letting them know what the conditions are to go back to the deal and, you know, offer some carrots in public and sticks privately. I don't think that there have been discussions directly with the Iranians.

Case in point, they're now, you know, increasing the amount of uranium that they have. They're increasing the level at which it's-- so we're seeing the Iranians, basically, despite all the rhetoric by Trump, doing whatever it is they want to do, and they don't give a hoot about what Trump, you know, puts on sanctions on them. Look at the disaster of results he got out of the deal, but look at the test of results. We're a lot worse off than we were before he got out of the deal.

So the bottom line is that I think that there should have been a different approach to Iran. Yes, of course, we all believe that a diplomatic resolution of the Iranian problem, whether it's ballistic missiles or, you know, the uranium development, et cetera-- you know, all of these are a main issues. But the way they just-- out of the box, this new administration has said we want to go back to the deal, that's a little worrisome. What kind of a signal are you sending?

ANDY SERWER: Right. The president, as you said, certainly has his hands full on the foreign policy front, as well. I noticed that Kim Jong Un was rattling around and making some noise. And of course, he's still there running North Korea so no shortage of things for the President-elect to have to be concerned about there.

HAIM SABAN: No question.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Haim, and ask you about Saban Capital Group, which includes a company focused on acquiring and distributing feature films and another on music production. Talk about what the business has been like during COVID, and what do you expect during 2021?

HAIM SABAN: Well, traditional media, where we invested our monies over the last 20 years-- we're not a fund. We work with our own money. And we've invested in things like Univision. We bought the largest media company in Germany. We bought the incumbent telecom company and Israel, bought and then sold, and the same thing for Germany. Traditional media is no longer, in our view, an opportunity for private equity.

So we have switched our focus to real estate. We're a big-- well, everything is relative, obviously-- but, you know, we're a multibillion-dollar holder of real estate assets. We have switched our efforts to things like acquiring finished films and distributing them, primarily in the US and the UK.

And music is my first love. I started off playing in a band then I was a producer and an agent and manager. And I'm having a lot of fun with it. I love Latin music. Latin music is exploding. So I love working in the studio. Believe it or not, I go to the studio and work with the producers and the writers and the singers, and it's been a lot of fun.

We launched, about a year ago, our first record. We already have, between our four artists, more than 1 billion streams across different platforms. So we're on our way to have a successful music company. And for me, to listen to music at home and come up with ideas for the artists to implement and share it with them, et cetera, it's been a lot of fun. I love it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I noticed you got your start in music, and I want to ask you about that. I mean, first of all, I think you had a principal who told you you weren't a good student. You self-described yourself as not a terribly good musician. And yet, you've been so successful. So I'm wondering, what is your core competency? You know, what is Haim Saban really good at?

HAIM SABAN: Nothing and everything. Because really good is a very committing statement. So really good? Nothing. Pretty good-- you know, instinct this is a very important trait. And I have been blessed to-- don't get me wrong. I've made plenty of mistakes and made investments that didn't necessarily pan out as I was planning to. On balance, everything is great, but there have been mistakes along the way. And my instincts, in most cases, have served me well and in some cases, not so well. So--

ANDY SERWER: Right. Now, I noticed you have that guitar behind you. Is there any way you could play us a tune?

HAIM SABAN: There is no way because I think you mentioned before that I admitted to being a lousy musician. So I don't want to-- I am. But being a lousy musician, you can still be a great producer, by the way. And the millions of records I have sold as a producer, when I lived in France, is proof to the fact that I knew what I was doing. And you know, the beginning of the success that we're having here with our music company, which is one year old, you know, is proof that, you know, I have a sense of what people want to listen to.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, sort of like you don't have to be the best baseball player to be the best baseball manager.

HAIM SABAN: That's a very good analogy, absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And so just one more thing about this guitar playing on your part, what do you like to play? If you're not going to play it for us, then what do you like to play, what kind of music?

HAIM SABAN: I love all kinds of music. I love all kinds of music. My playlists include everything from classic to Israeli music, classic Israeli music, modern Israeli music, Latin music, pop. I admit that I don't understand hip-hop, so I don't listen to it because I just-- I can't get my arms around hip-hop. I just don't know what's good, what's not good, and there's nothing about hip-hop that's appealing to me, at please. But overall, any kind of music, you know, that pleases my ear pleases my soul. So that's how it works.

ANDY SERWER: Right. And let me ask you, is streaming helping or hurting right now? I mean, eventually, your acts would have to perform live at some point again, right?

HAIM SABAN: Well, realistically speaking, the numbers speak for themselves. 27% of revenue for artists come from streaming, unless you're a phenomenon like Drake or J Balvin. 27% comes from streaming, 63% from all other sources-- touring, merchandising, branding, and the like. And the 63% has been frozen.

But we all hope that with the vaccine, whether it takes another six months or another 12 months-- I don't think anybody has a true sense to put a date on it-- but it will come back. It will come back. And once it comes back, that 63% of sources of revenue will be back on the table, so yeah.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned real estate, which is curious to me because a lot of people would say, wow, that's not a good business to be in right now because of COVID. What's your thesis there?

HAIM SABAN: Well, there-- we are in a-- we don't develop anything. We buy yield, if you will. And we are in categories that have been COVID resistant-- GSA, which is government, as a tenant, self-storage, student housing, you know, manufactured housing. So I am, you know, very sorry for all those that have suffered from COVID in the real estate area, but we have been very fortunate to have been minimally affected-- minimally.

ANDY SERWER: And you mentioned Univision, of course, which is a deal and a company that you're known for. Where does that stand? You wound that investment up, correct?

HAIM SABAN: Well, we just sold it. We just sold it.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

HAIM SABAN: That was not a shining moment in my investment career, I must admit, because we have been, you know, suffering what all traditional media has suffered. Linear television, according to Bob Iger, the Disney chairman, in 10 years, will not exist. So very few people say, OK, it's Thursday, 9:00 PM. Let's turn on CBS and watch this show. That's not how people watch TV these days. So so many people don't-- especially in the younger generation, don't even have cable or satellite.

So traditional media, we have been one of the victims of the gradual erosion of traditional media. So hey, you win some, you lose some, right? So--

ANDY SERWER: It was--

HAIM SABAN: But if, on balance, you win, you're good.

ANDY SERWER: That-- yes. It was hard to see that coming, I guess. Is there anything you look back on now and realize you could have done differently with that deal?

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, I could have taken my money and put it in an index, and it would have tripled and I wouldn't have had to work that hard for 14 years. So but, you know, who would have known, 14 years ago, that, you know, traditional media would be where it is today?

ANDY SERWER: Well, I think it's great that you can laugh about it because some people would just say, I don't want to talk about it. So the fact that you've sort of processed it and let it go, to an extent, I think is a healthy thing.

HAIM SABAN: No, I let it go. I let it go. I mean, you know, it is what it is. What's important is on balance, what's our investment performance overall. That's more important, in my opinion, than any one specific deal. No one has nothing but wins-- no one, not Warren Buffett, not Bill Gates. No one has nothing but wins. You win some, you lose some, and that's OK.

ANDY SERWER: Only Bernie Madoff had nothing but wins.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: That should have made people suspicious.

HAIM SABAN: Yeah, well, exactly. Thank God we didn't have a Donald with him.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Big tech companies, like Apple and Amazon, have been getting into original content, Haim. Do you think they'll succeed?

HAIM SABAN: If they decide, as a matter of a strategic, you know, goal, they'll have no problem because they have all the money in the world to buy the biggest talent in America. And by definition, when you're able to work with the biggest talent, you're going to have a huge success.

So yeah, eventually, yeah, it's just a matter of a strategic decision for the Apple of this world to say, OK, I'm going to be bigger than any other studio. OK, and I have $250 billion in the bank, and I generate billions of dollars of free cash flow. I'm going to do it. And they do it. So I think that it's only a matter of strategic decision for them.

ANDY SERWER: Another thing you're known for is ""Power Rangers,"" and so that brings me to ask you, what do you think future trends look like in the media business, both in terms of content, maybe, and in terms of distribution? How are you seeing things?

HAIM SABAN: Well, I'll speak to the kids business, and the kids business will always be there because every year, new kids are born. And interestingly enough, during this COVID time, companies like Mattel and Hasbro are doing really well. Their sales are up by double digits.

So I think that the toy business is not going away. Entertainment for kids is not going away. We have many more platforms than we used to have, obviously. Take one example of a show called ""Cocomelon,"" which has tens of millions of followers on YouTube.

And so I think that the kids business is going to continue flourishing, again, as I said, for the simple reason that new kids are born every year. So it's a no-brainer.

ANDY SERWER: When you have your content on YouTube, though, can you monetize that? Or are you just helping out Sundar Pichai over at Google to get rich?

HAIM SABAN: Sundar Pichai gets less rich than Sergey Brin and-- what's the name of the other one?

ANDY SERWER: Larry Page.

HAIM SABAN: And Larry Page. Yeah, they get richer than Sundar. He gets plenty rich, but they-- of course you monetize it. A show like ""Cocomelon,"" I am sure, has, you know, very broad merchandising campaigns everywhere. And they sell toys, and they can go on live shows, once live shows come back.

YouTube delivers significant exposure. They're pretty stingy about how they share their revenues with creators, but there's still quite a bit of money, if you're very successful on YouTube. And then all the ancillaries are there, so they absolutely-- shows like ""Cocomelon"" are making a lot of money.

ANDY SERWER: You've been involved in media M&A over the years, as we've talked about a little bit. How would you assess the most recent ones and how they're doing so far, which is to say Time Warner and AT&T and Fox and Disney, companies you know a little bit more about?

HAIM SABAN: Right. Well, AT&T did the right thing to buy DirecTV when they did. And we know that they bought it-- I used-- I was on the board at the time of DirecTV. They bought it for $50 billion, and now it's up for sale for $15 billion.

ANDY SERWER: Nice.

HAIM SABAN: So they, like us, have become victims of traditional media problem that we have worldwide, by the way. So from that point of view, not so great. The Time Warner-- or the Warner, I should say--

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

HAIM SABAN: --content that they bought, I think, was a good move. And they got a great guy, Jason Kilar, a guy with a vision, to run it. And I think that they're doing some very interesting things. I think they're going to come out really well with the Warner acquisition, in my humble opinion.

ANDY SERWER: And then Fox and Disney?

HAIM SABAN: Well, that's one that stunned me because Rupert doesn't sell anything. He doesn't like to sell absolutely anything. And that one, he realized, it's a matter of too big to be small and too small to be big. So he really needed to make a move, either acquire, which he did try to acquire Warner, because he realized, you need more scale, both at the content and-- as well as the distribution level.

So when he identified the fact that, you know, there wasn't much for him to buy to-- and again, this is my humble opinion-- and Bob Iger came to him with this offer, he said, well, OK, I'll go the other way. I'll play the Disney card. And I'm assuming he took stock, so he's doing all right. Rupert is doing all right.

ANDY SERWER: And finally, last question, Haim, this show is called ""Influencers,"" and so I'm curious how you see using your influence on the world.

HAIM SABAN: Well, that is-- how can I-- well, first of all, I might have some influence outside of my household. When I walk back into my household, it's-- as Jackie Mason likes to say, I say, where should I put my jacket? You know, I don't have that much influence.

So on the world, I think that people who have been as fortunate as I have been just simply need to give back. This is how you can-- you know, identify weak points in society that you feel you can be helpful with, and just give back. There's no better feeling than the feeling of giving back. There is no more gratifying feeling than the feeling of giving back. And that's what my wife and I have been doing now for-- I don't know-- 30 years is just giving back to society.

There are some specific causes that are of interest to us. Like health and battered women are of great interest to my wife, the rape center and so on and so forth, the free clinic that carries our name. We are very, very sensitive to people's suffering, and we try to do our part.

ANDY SERWER: Well, best of luck to you on that front and in all your endeavors. Haim Saban, chairman and CEO of Saban Capital Group, thank you so much for joining us today.

HAIM SABAN: Thank you very much.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the elections worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they cut him off like all the online entities cut him off, Facebook and Twitter, outside of Fox News, Fox News is a special animal within itself, but if all the other media, television media, simply don't give him a platform.

You give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans from birther all the way to inciting this group of meshuggeners to go up on the Hill. You know, so he's going to continue. And if he's cut off from the media, you know, he won't be able to have the same impact.

ANDY SERWER: Meshuggener is Yiddish for crazy people.

HAIM SABAN: That's-- I thought that everybody knows what meshuggener is, including in Georgia and Mississippi. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

ANDY SERWER: Probably the case. Let me ask you about President-elect Biden, because I know you've been a supporter of his, Haim. And he's talking about unifying the country. Is that still possible when a significant portion of the opposition party questions the legitimacy of the Democratic system?

HAIM SABAN: Well, it questions the legitimacy because they believe Trump. If Trump stood up and said, OK, we had a fair election, it is a legitimate election, he is the next president, we wouldn't see any of that. They are just following Trump. Yes, the 74 million people who voted for him, yes, 70% of those 74 million people believe the election was stolen because he says so, because he says so.

So if he has no platform to continue spewing all these lies, then, you know, we're not going to have this kind of-- and there will always be division. There's always-- always have been divisions, but not at that level and not divisions that manifest itself-- a division that manifests itself with violence the way we saw last Wednesday. So if Trump is cut off from the media, we're going to see that division, you know, really calm down, and there will be no one to fan those flames.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk now, Haim, about how companies are complicit, how the private sector is complicit. First of all, we talked about Facebook and Twitter and about they've banned him now, so that's number one. But then there's also the cable companies that run Newsmax and OAN and the telcos as well.

Then there are companies that contribute to candidates-- or I should say Congress people who supported blocking the certification. You've seen some companies now say they're not going to support them anymore. And then there's companies, say, using Trump hotels and golf courses and saying they're not going to do that anymore. How far should this go, in your opinion?

HAIM SABAN: You're asking my opinion? My opinion, you should go all the way. But my opinion is secondary. I go back to the point of Trump being given a platform and his followers following what he says. No platform, you know, we're going to see a huge difference.

So I hope very much that outside of, as I call them, the meshuggeners, meaning the crazy people on the extreme right, outside of them and there may be a website here and a website there, you cannot block everything on the internet, but the main media should stop giving Trump a platform, because that will make Biden's job of uniting the country very difficult.

Netflix’s “Tiger King” star Carole Baskin appears to be quite the influencer — even when it comes to penny stocks.

Little known Michigan-based animal health and veterinarian penny stock Zomedica surged nearly 250% since earning a mention from Netflix’s “Tiger King” star Carole Baskin last week. In a video re-posted to YouTube, Baskin delivers a glowing review for the company, saying ""I don't know if you guys have heard about Zomedica, but they help our veterinarians and our furry friends” and that she is “definitely invested in finding out more” about the company.

But Yahoo Finance has confirmed that what appeared to be an endorsement from Baskin was nothing more than the result of a request from someone on Cameo, a platform where users can pay for video messages.

“It was a Cameo they paid for,” Baskin told Yahoo Finance. “I don't hold any stock in the company and don't make stock recommendations.”

CONFIRMED: Carole Baskin tells me her Zomedica mention that may have triggered a 230% rally in the penny stock came from a $299 Cameo request

""It was a Cameo they paid for. I don't hold any stock in the company and don't make stock recommendations."" https://t.co/6t4vRujGBl

Zomedica (ZOM) did not respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment. It’s also possible the request could have come from an outside investor looking to spark an increase in the share price that sat at just $0.40 last week. The Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company, which went public in 2016, has yet to achieve any revenue, according to financial statements highlighted by Yahoo Finance’s Myles Udland.

The penny stock was also among the most actively traded by volume on popular retail investor platform Robinhood, according to analytics firm Breakout Point. It’s not unusual to see penny stocks like Zomedica appear on a list of most active tickers, but as Themis Trading’s Joseph Saluzzi points out, it is very rare to see those stocks account for such a large share of the overall market’s trading volume as it did Monday. Zomedica shares, along with five other stocks trading under $1, represented 18% of the entire market.

A video request from Baskin on Cameo currently costs $299. Due to the number of requests for paid messages the Netflix star receives, Baskin says she wasn’t able to recall who ordered the message that requested she seemingly endorse the upcoming launch of Zomedica’s testing platform for disorders in dogs and cats. In Baskin’s video, she echoes that “they think it’s going to be a really big seller.”

“It’s going to be a good one. I just feel it in my cat bones,” Baskin says, before imploring viewers to check it out.

Reached after Zomedica’s 40% rise in trading Tuesday, Baskin expressed her doubts that she alone could have influenced the excitement.

“I find it hard to believe that my Cameo would affect anyone's stocks,” she said.

However, in a sign that speculation may have reached a tipping point, that wouldn’t even be the first instance of misplaced investor enthusiasm this week — and it’s Tuesday. On Monday, shares in little known health care tech company Signal Advance plummeted 50% after it became apparent investors mistakenly piled into that stock following a tweet last week from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk tweeted about an encrypted messaging service, called Signal, in a Friday tweet that simply said, “Use Signal.” That sparked a nearly 400% rally the following trading day in Signal Advance shares.

Whether Baskin’s shout out results in a sustained rally or a reversal in Zomedica shares remains to be seen.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Influencers. I am Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Haim Saban, media mogul, Democratic mega-donor, chairman and CEO of private investment firm, Saban Capital. Haim, nice to see you.

HAIM SABAN: Nice to see you.

ANDY SERWER: So a lot of political news to talk about, and I know you're keenly interested in politics. So let me ask you about what happened last week with regard to the attack on the capitol. Do you think that President Trump is in some way to blame for the siege on the capitol, and what do you think we should do about this?

HAIM SABAN: Well, the only inaccurate statement you made is, ""in some way."" In every single way, he is responsible. I mean, he is the one who has been fermented this hate and division in the American people for four years, and it culminated in him calling on them to go to the capitol. I'm no lawyer, but it sounds to me like incitement to commit, you know, a crime. And he should be held accountable for inciting to commit a crime. You know, I'm assuming that no one is above the law in America, and I think it's a fair assumption.

ANDY SERWER: Do you agree that he should leave office before January 20, impeached by Congress, or resign, perhaps?

HAIM SABAN: What I really believe is that after what he did and after the way he treated the very loyal lieutenant, I really think that Pence should call for the 25th Amendment. That's what I believe. It would make sense for him to go play golf in Florida and leave us alone.

That's what I believe, but, apparently, Pence is not ready to do that. So there is no reason, no rhyme or reason to have somebody who committed a crime, to let that person off the hook. I don't see the reason.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think that Donald Trump is going to continue to play a dominant role in the Republican Party after this, Haim?

HAIM SABAN: It depends on the media. If the media gives him the platform they gave him before the elections, worth billions of dollars of exposure, and if they cut him off like all the online entities cut him off, Facebook and Twitter, if, outside of Fox News-- Fox News is a special animal within itself. But if all the other media, television media, simply don't give him a platform-- you give him a platform, he's going to continue with his shenanigans from birther all the way to inciting this group of meshuganas to go up on the Hill.

Believes Evidence Shows That Magnite Is Currently Masking Pre-Merger Challenges, Including Clear Accounting and Business Challenges, With Inaccurate Financial Reporting

Believes That Magnite Faces Revenue Headwinds As Customers Consolidate, Quality CTV Inventory Diminishes, And One-Time Election-Year Spikes Fade

Documents Concerns Regarding Management's Conduct and Destruction of Investor Value in Previous Leadership Roles

Urges Investors To Visit www.SprucePointCap.com And Follow @SprucePointCap Via Twitter For Latest On $MGNI

NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Spruce Point Capital Management, LLC (""Spruce Point"" or ""we"" or ""us""), a New York-based investment management firm that focuses on forensic research and short-selling, today issued a detailed and expansive report entitled ""A Repellent Investment"" that outlines why shares of Magnite, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGNI) (""Magnite"" or the ""Company"") face up to 50% downside risk to under $14 per share. The full report can be downloaded and viewed at www.sprucepointcap.com. Follow us on Twitter @sprucepointcap for additional information and exclusive updates.

Magnite was formed in early 2020 following the merger of two advertising technology companies: Telaria Inc. (""Telaria"", formerly Tremor Video) and The Rubicon Project, Inc. (""Rubicon""). The merger was predicated upon cost savings – instead of revenue synergies – and to the anticipated scaling of a Connected TV (""CTV"") product, which Rubicon could not build alone. CTV advertising has become increasingly popular with the rise of streaming and web-based content distributors such as Hulu, Disney (NYSE: DIS), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU). However, our research indicates that Magnite currently lacks the depth of quality CTV inventory to adequately scale.

Story continues

Spruce Point believes Magnite's ~400% share price appreciation since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is completely unjustified. It appears that the market has largely overlooked the Company's clear growth headwinds and highly-questionable management team, which we believe has been masking business challenges with inaccurate financial reporting. We believe our research shows that management is running two separate businesses, but structuring Magnite's financial reporting as if the Company has a lone operating segment. We believe that this dubious reporting style may be allowing Magnite to conceal challenges that have seen Magnite suffer pro forma revenue decline by 1% year-to-date, while public industry peers The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) and PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM) grow 16%.

A high-level overview of some of the detailed findings in Spruce Point's downloadable report includes:

Prior to the merger, publicly-available material indicates that both Telaria and Rubicon were hampered with business and accounting struggles. Telaria issued warnings about potential material weaknesses, including in its last 10-K filing, and its reported capital expenditures were negative prior to the merger. Most concerning, however, is our discovery that Telaria made nearly $10 million of assets and liabilities inexplicably disappear from its preliminary closing valuation. Evidence also shows that Rubicon was under severe pressure pre-merger, failing to deliver on expectations with its apparently exaggerated growth opportunities. We believe this explains why Rubicon sought to merge with Telaria, which had at least one revenue driver (CTV). Rubicon stopped regular reporting of key metrics such as Ad Spend and Take Rate and changed its Free Cash Flow to a non-standard calculation in our view. Spruce Point always warns investors to be cautious when key disclosures disappear or when key metrics change.  Post-merger, evidence suggests Magnite is struggling and running two separate businesses while only reporting one operating segment. We question what management is hiding with two separate businesses and only one set of financials, especially given that at the very onset of the merger, management made clear that both businesses were ""quite different"" and would function as two separate business units on two separate platforms. Instead, Magnite's website provides unique login portals for Telaria and Rubicon, respectively. We also discovered that Telaria still has its own employees – including in financial and accounting roles no less – demonstrating that Magnite appears to be misrepresenting and misreporting its business by running two separate businesses behind the scenes. We also find that pro forma revenue results do not add up when combining Telaria and Rubicon reported revenue. As another sign that something is dramatically wrong, Magnite's pro forma organic sales are down 1% year-to-date 2020 with peers up 16%. We estimate Magnite's pro forma operating cash flow is down 143% year-to-date 2020.  Evidence suggests Magnite likely faces significant business headwinds, which are not properly reflected in its currently inflated share price. Despite management's historical and future growth story claims, we believe that the 2020 election cycle had an outsized impact on recent Q3 2020 results, adding an estimated $5 million revenue benefit to its highly promoted CTV business. Absent this one-off contribution, we estimate CTV revenue would have declined 16% on a year-over-year basis. We believe Magnite faces business headwinds due to increased customer concentration with XUMO, Pluto and Hulu all coming under control recently by larger corporations. In our experience, rarely is it good news for small vendors when large corporate behemoths acquire smaller, more entrepreneurial companies. Finally, creditors changed Magnite's financial covenant from ""Adjusted EBITDA"" to ""Maximum Cash Burn"" suggesting that further pressures could lie ahead.  We believe Magnite is led by a highly-questionable, unimpressive leadership team. We believe analysts have wildly marked up Magnite's sales expectations largely on the back of a single quarter and promotion from an analyst with a checkered past. Magnite's shares are heavily promoted by Needham & Company (""Needham""), which blessed the merger with a fairness opinion. We believe that Needham analyst Laura Martin incorrectly models revenue growth as increasing 36% on a year-over-year basis due to an understated pro forma revenue base, when our calculations estimate that Magnite's true 2020 expected organic growth is a meager 1.7%. In addition, we believe Ms. Martin incorrectly compares Magnite to an early The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) in terms of market share and growth. Our research suggests this is a long shot. Investors should be aware that legal documents show that Ms. Martin played a role in promoting the 2000 AOL/Time Warner merger, which later settled SEC accounting fraud charges. Legal documents alleged that Ms. Martin was willing to write glowing commentary on AOL so as not to offend management though she was aware AOL was engaging in accounting gimmickry. We believe investors should be incredibly wary of Needham's steep price targets on Magnite and conduct their own independent due diligence.

It is also notable that insiders have also been sellers of Magnite shares, which should give investors serious pause. If these insiders were so bullish on the Telaria-Rubicon merger, we believe they would have been buying stock cheap ahead of the recent price increase, not selling.

Please note that the items summarized in this press release are expanded upon and supported with data, public filings and records, and images in Spruce Point's full report. As a reminder, our full report, along with its investment disclaimers, can be downloaded and viewed at www.sprucepointcap.com.

Spruce Point has a short position in Magnite, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGNI) and owns derivative securities that stand to benefit if its share price falls. Spruce Point also has long positions in PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) which stand to benefit if their share prices increase.

64,2021-01-05T12:09:31+00:00,Universal Music Plans Africa Push In Streaming Business: Bloomberg,"Universal Music Group Inc is planning to expand its foothold in the African continent, Bloomberg reports. French media company Vivendi SE (OTC: VIVHY) is a majority shareholder in Universal music. Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings ADR (OTC: TCEHY) recently purchased a 10% stake from Vivendi, along with a one-year call option to buy an additional 10%.

What Happened: Bloomberg notes that one of Universal Music’s focus for 2021 is to expand operations in Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana, based on comments from recently appointed Universal Music CEO for South Africa and the Sub-Sahara African region, Sipho Dlamini.

In an email statement to Bloomberg, Dlamini opined that the long-term development of infrastructure could present local talent with more opportunities and a platform to engage new audiences across the world.

Dlamini also clarified in the statement that Universal Music would engage with telecom giants like MTN Group Ltd ADR (OTC: MTNOY), Vodacom Group Limited, and Orange SA (NYSE: ORAN), who have a presence in this region.

Why Does It Matter: A research by Statista in March 2020, published in November, on the share of internet users in Africa shows Kenya at the top with a penetration rate of 87.2%. The growing smartphone availability and access to the internet in the African countries could be one of the complementing factors for Universal Music’s streaming growth.

The International Federation of Phonographic Industry claims that Africa and the Middle East recorded a 16% uptick in recorded music revenues and crossed the $100 million thresholds in 2019, Bloomberg reports.

In mid-December, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) also welcomed the Zimbabwean Billionaire Strive Masiyiwa as the first African appointed as a board member to boost its presence in Africa.

Price Action: VIVHY stock closed at $32.17, 0.23% higher on Monday.

So, between the weather and the novel coronavirus, people are going to stay indoors as much as possible. That means they’ll be consuming a ton of media for information and entertainment. And therein lies the opportunity for investors — assuming they can sniff out the right media stocks to buy.

As such, I have seven suggestions, ranging from a 170 year-old newspaper pioneer to the leading streaming video service. I have also included picks you might not think of immediately, like companies that deliver the media and one that makes it better.

Media Stocks to Buy: Cable One (CABO) A back view of a multi-generation family watching TV.

First up on this list of media stocks to buy is Cable One. This Arizona-based broadband provider offers internet, phone and cable TV services to over 950,000 customers in 21 states. The company is also active in both residential and business markets, working under its Sparklight and Clearwave brands.

Cable One is growing, both organically and through acquisitions. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company noted the closing of two recent acquisitions of regional telecommunications providers. CABO also posted big yearly gains. Those acquisitions helped boost residential customers by over 165,000 year-over-year (YOY) for a 26.7% gain. Revenue was also up 18.9% YOY.

Now CABO stock is up 51% year-to-date (YTD) in 2020 and up nearly 419% over the past five years. Finally, adding to its attraction, Cable One also pays investors a dividend. So, it’s clearly one of the better media stocks for investors focused on growth.

Charter is a broadband provider that operates in 41 states under the Spectrum Brand. With over 30 million residential and business customers, it’s one of the top three providers in the U.S. market. Demand for broadband access to internet and streaming video has helped CHTR stock achieve sustained growth. Shares are up nearly 35% YTD and 257% over the past five years.

Additionally, the company’s push into mobile internet access is also paying off. In Q3, Charter added 363,000 new mobile lines for a total of 2.1 million. Mobile revenue growth was also up 91.8% YOY in Q3.

The Wall Street Journal is tracking 28 investment analysts who are covering the name. They give CHTR stock a consensus overweight rating and an average 12-month price target of $704. That offers a modest 7.5% upside. However, based on this year’s 35% gain, I suspect they are being conservative.

The 7 Safest Stocks to Start Off 2021 on the Right Foot

Right now, the pandemic has proven that broadband access is more important than ever. Moreover, Charter’s impressive mobile growth will also drive ongoing gains. That makes this pick one of the better media stocks to buy.

Dolby is one of those companies that is immediately identifiable as a key part of the media landscape. You see the name everywhere. But this company doesn’t generate content nor does it deliver it. Instead, Dolby is primarily focused on making content sound better.

Whenever you see the Dolby logo on a product — a TV, a soundbar, a home or car audio system, headphones, a game console or something else — the company is collecting a licensing fee. And when it comes to the pandemic, people stuck at home and streaming shows or playing video games want the experience to be as immersive as possible. As such, they’ve been snapping up soundbars with Dolby Atmos for three-dimensional surround audio.

While that’s been good for business, though, the company has also been feeling the negative effects of the pandemic, with many movie theaters closed. In fact, Covid-19 has caused an overall hit to Dolby this year. Revenue for 2020 was $1.16 billion, down about 6.5% from the $1.24 billion it made in 2019.

However, DLB stock has still posted an impressive gain of 41% YTD. Plus next year, with positives like a vaccine and the iPhone 12 now supporting Dolby Vision, there may still be upside for this media creation and consumption stock. Even if a theater recovery is already priced into the current value, five-year growth of 183% suggests this pick of the media stocks to buy is worth considering for its long-term prospects.

Have you heard of FuboTV? If not, think Netflix but for live sports. Now, you would imagine that during a pandemic year — when professional sports have been highly impacted — FUBO might be feeling some pain. Instead, it’s actually been the opposite.

In fact, sports-starved consumers are forking over their cash for FuboTV subscriptions. In Q2, the company reported that paid subscribers topped 286,000. That’s a 47% YOY increase. Additionally, revenue was up 53%. More specifically, advertising revenue posted a 71% gain year-over-year.

On top of that, as professional sports leagues slowly began to return to action, FUBO reaped further rewards recently. In Q3, it exceeded guidance and delivered one of its best quarters ever. Paid subscribers hit 455,000 while revenue of $62.1 million was up 47%. Advertising revenue grew by 153%.

FUBO stock was flat through most of 2020. However, the Q3 results kickstarted a rapid growth cycle. That increased as the company gained visibility and rumors began to swirl about it signing a deal for exclusive sports coverage.

9 Long-Term Stocks for the Next Decade

So, after spending most of the year in the $10 range, FUBO stock took off in November. Now after a correction, it still stands at around 230% YTD growth at $29.30. Based on its pandemic performance, increased visibility and the possibility of an exclusive deal in the future, FUBO is one of those media stocks to buy that has big growth potential.

Liberty Broadband Series C (LBRDK) couple on a couch watching tv with man holding remote

Next on my list of media stocks to buy is Liberty Broadband, a name that owns or invests in a range of communications businesses. The company’s holdings include a 29% stake in the previously discussed Charter. It also owns 100% of both GCI — an Alaskan telecommunications provider — and Skyhook, a global mobile-positioning company.

In its third quarter, Liberty Broadband reported revenue up just over 13%. What’s more, the pandemic has had relatively negligible adverse effects on its business:

“We are not presently aware of any events or circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that would require us to update our estimates or judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities.”

Right now, LBRDK stock has had 26% growth so far in 2020. What’s more, analysts covering the stock have rated it as a consensus buy. Their median price target of $182 has 16% upside, showing confidence that this is one of the better media stocks to buy with a solid growth trajectory.

You can’t talk about media stocks to buy in 2020 without mentioning the company that kicked off the video streaming era. Of course, Netflix has had some big positives this year, but it has also faced challenges that scared off some investors.

The first two quarters of 2020 brought a surge in subscriber growth as pandemic lockdowns boosted demand for entertainment. That slowed in Q3, but the unexpected gains were still a big win for the year. They helped soothe fears that the dramatic increase in streaming competition would drag Netflix down. In addition, Netflix saw cash flow significantly improve in 2020. Right now, the company is approaching the point where it can finance its own productions without having to borrow money. That is a good sign for long-term sustainability.

After early gains and a roller-coaster summer and fall, NFLX stock is showing growth of nearly 67% YTD. You can’t argue with that kind of performance. Plus, currently NFLX is still well off its 52-week high. That makes it an even more attractive buy.

Last on this list of stocks is the old gray lady of media — the New York Times. Now, NYT may be the last company many people think of when it comes to media stocks to buy. Streaming video companies, sure. But a newspaper?

Here’s the thing. People still want to read the news –it’s just that they want to do it on their tablet, phone or laptop. Recognizing that trend, the New York Times is doing a far better job than most in transitioning to the digital world. More importantly, it’s doing a far better job of convincingpeople to pay for access. The news organization first launched a paywall in 2011.

Just in November, it also announced it had reached a significant milestone in digital transformation. For the first time ever, revenue from its digital subscribers surpassed revenue from print subscriptions. Those 7 million digital subscribers helped the company to double net income in the last quarter, even though advertising revenue continued to slowly slide.

Despite plummeting in the early 2000s as ad revenue fell and the future of newspapers was in doubt, NYT stock has been in growth mode for the past five years. Currently, it’s up 61% YTD. So, this name is well worth considering if you’re looking for a media stock that can survive and thrive in a rapidly transforming marketplace.

66,2020-12-28T21:34:41+00:00,Analyst: 'Wonder Woman 1984' shows consumers eager to head back to the movies despite streaming threat,"“Wonder Woman 1984” (T) is giving theater chains a much needed boost of confidence.

The sequel, which debuted in approximately 2,150 theater locations across the U.S. on Christmas day but received lackluster viewer reviews, grossed $16.7 million domestically in its opening weekend — far exceeding expectations.

Even with the downbeat reception, the results solidified the Amazon princess’ second adventure as the best performing film opening of the COVID-era — a tumultuous time period which saw even Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” fall flat with viewers. The latter only generated about $9 million during its Labor Day weekend debut this year. “Tenet” only generated about $9 million during its domestic box office debut this year whereas “Wonder Woman 1984” brought in 16.7 million

However, theater markets in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco still remain shut down as COVID-19 surges nationwide.

With operations still facing 50% capacity limits across the U.S., “we estimate the $16.7M opening for ‘WW84’ could actually equate to as much as $110M - $120M box office opening under normal circumstances,” B. Riley Securities Analyst Eric Wold wrote in a recent note shared with Yahoo Finance.

“The original ‘Wonder Woman’ released in 2017 generated $103M in opening weekend box office,” according to Wold. In fact, Warner Brothers has enough confidence in the franchise to begin fast-tracking a third installment, according to the media giant.

“We believe this helps support the thesis that when consumers are allowed back to theaters with attractive content, they will once again become moviegoers — with the industry having the potential to begin returning to normal in 2022,” the analyst added. ""Wonder Woman 1984"" success proves that consumers will once again become moviegoers, according to one analyst

Warner Bros. released the superhero flick in theaters the same day it debuted on the studio’s fledging streaming platform HBO Max. Earlier this month, the studio shocked the media landscape by announcing plans to air all of its 2021 movies this way.

The hybrid release strategy was immediately met with scrutiny from major theater chains, with AMC (AMC) saying Warner was sacrificing profitability in order to “subsidize its HBO Max start up.”

Story continues

Although specific HBO Max numbers have not yet been released, WarnerMedia said nearly half of all paying subscribers tuned in to watch the film on its first day — with the platform setting a single-day record for downloads of its mobile app.

But the successful turnout still doesn’t mean consumers wouldn’t have preferred the big screen under a different set of circumstances.

According to Wold, “the decision made by HBO Max subscribers to watch ‘WW84’ at home was more of a decision made for them by local theaters being closed and stay-at-home restrictions, as opposed to the preferred way to watch blockbuster films going forward.”

With so much on the line, “we believe Warner Bros. is more likely than not to reverse course and abandon this plan by mid-year — and either return to a more traditional distribution strategy or adopt one similar the Universal agreement entered into with both AMC and Cinemark Holdings (CNK),” the note added.

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: Well, my family Christmas tradition tends to consist of getting Chinese food and going to the movies. But obviously, things are a little bit different this year. We will not be going out to a theater, but we will have to choose what to watch on a streaming service. We're joined now by Gitesh Pandya. He is the Box Office Guru founder and editor. Gitesh, thank you for being here.

And obviously, things have changed in terms of how companies are coming out with their movies now, how studios are coming out. And I think the biggest marker of this change might be ""Wonder Woman"" being out on HBO Max streaming simultaneously with what is going on in the theaters. The people you're talking to in the industry-- I mean, how big of a change is this? How long-lasting of a change do they think it will be?

GITESH PANDYA: Well, it's a bit of a panic that's been going across the industry, as far as will this be a game-changer? Will other studios follow? I think it's very experimental. I think it's a bold move that Warner Brothers made. Now, obviously, movie theaters have been closed for a long time this year. Normally, the box office would be in the $10-$11 billion range. A year ago, it was $11.4 billion in 2019. This year, for 2020, we're one week away from finishing, I'm projecting $2.3 billion for 2020. That's an 80% plunge. That's 80% of the box office wiped out this year because theaters are closed.

And it's not going to change too much in the first quarter of next year. So much of 2021, a lot of theaters closed, slowly reopening. Warner Brothers hedging their bets and saying, listen, we're going to open these movies in theaters where they are allowed, but also on HBO Max in the United States over a 30-day window to drive subscribers. And ""Wonder Woman 1984"" is the first movie to try this sort of new strategy. It's this weekend. I've had a chance to see it. It is a movie you want to see on the big screen. It's a superhero film, but obviously, about a third or so of the theaters across the US are not even open. So you'll see an audience of comic book fans seeing this at home on HBO Max this weekend.

Story continues

But it does open the door for this whole holiday season for people to see movies like this at home on streaming. And then, the other studios so far have not been following suit, but we'll have to wait and see.

BRIAN SOZZI: Gitesh, let's stay on the movie theaters. What does the movie theater industry look like after the pandemic?

GITESH PANDYA: It's incredibly challenging. And in my opinion, I think it's about the experience. That's where the theaters have to really push it. They need to offer a bigger and better experience in the theater that you cannot get at home because if one thing that we've seen in 2020, it's that the amount of streaming content has skyrocketed-- not just B-list product, but A-list product. Almost everything is coming at home because of necessity.

So that's a new challenge at theaters have next year. So when it comes to the seats, the food, the concessions, the drinks, live entertainment or live talent doing interactive Q&As, things like that-- anything that theaters can do to up the experience, to make it unique, exciting is going to help.

Also, the premium formats-- IMAX, 4DX-- that's something you can't get at home. So I do think that 2021 is going to be led by the bigger brands, the big action films, the movies that really take advantage of the big screen experience. And over the next two years or so, we'll start seeing some of the smaller films get back as well. But it's going to be the experience, and these theaters have to up their game to get the bodies back into those seats.

JULIE HYMAN: Gitesh, for the movies that are being released streaming-- either streaming only or simultaneously in the theaters-- how do we measure those? Because traditionally you would get box office receipts from the theater companies. You could also do some on-the-ground research. Now, do we just have to rely on the studios or the streaming companies to give us the numbers?

GITESH PANDYA: Well, right. For streaming, it's a new methodology. Is called crossing your fingers. You have to hope that these companies release numbers. Usually, they'll release them on an earnings call at some point where it benefits them-- not on any regular basis. And so for some of these films, there are a lot of streams, a lot of views that are happening, and they will boost them, more from a PR perspective. And as far as the media goes, as far as consumers, we don't know exactly how much of a success each film is. The studios know themselves. They'll share what little they can.

But I think in the broader sense, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix, Amazon, and so on-- they are looking to drive subscribers. And you can do that by having more content, more unique exclusive content, and that's why you're seeing some of these studios who are affiliated with a streaming service push some of their titles to streaming only instead of a theatrical release.

For example, Disney-- they own Pixar. They have the movie ""Soul,"" which was supposed to come out last June in theaters. It got pushed, and now it's coming out on streaming tomorrow. It's a wonderful film. I recommend it. But it's not one of those sort of ""Toy Story"" franchise films which gets pushed until theaters are ready. It's going straight to streaming, and it helps to make Disney Plus a nice value for consumers.

And that's part of the point-- have the content roll in along with TV shows and other sort of items to drive those subscribers. And HBO Max's deal is one of them. But it's a crowded field, and you're going to see a lot of growth in all of these streaming services trying to live side by side with a rebuilding of the theatrical box office in 2021.

BRIAN SOZZI: All right, Gitesh, and Disney has a ton of content coming out next year. As you analyze their slate of content set to come to market, what grade would you put on it?

GITESH PANDYA: Oh, I'd say-- I'd give it an A, A minus. I think they have some terrific titles. 2019 was a banner year for Disney. I don't think we're going to see that again anytime soon. They had ""Avengers Endgame,"" ""Lion King,"" and so on. So for 2021, they still do have major films from the Marvel universe. Obviously, 2020 was the first time in a long time-- 12 years-- where no Marvel films came out. So those fans are hungry and waiting for ""Black Widow"" and more films to come out in 2021.

But you also have Pixar, and you also have the main Disney animation studio coming out with films. They do have ""Raya and the Last Dragon,"" which is a new original film coming out in March. This one will have the same format as ""Mulan,"" meaning it will have a Disney premiere access for $30 option for people who want that. The difference is ""Mulan"" did not play in US theaters. ""Raya"" will open in US theaters. They're hoping that a certain number of theaters will be open and ready to go for those who choose to see it that way. So it'll be a little bit of a hybrid model.

But they have a lot of content in all four quarters, and a lot of the industry will be looking to Disney to sort of lead the way in this charge to come back.

JULIE HYMAN: Gitesh, really quickly-- of the movies that are coming out on Christmas, what's your top recommendation?

GITESH PANDYA: Oh, well, you know, I would say Pixar's ""Soul"" is probably the top one. It's one of those meaning of life kind of films, good for all ages, makes you think. And I plan to see it again. It's a good one.

JULIE HYMAN: That's definitely news I can use in my household. Thank you so much, Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru.

Warner Brothers hedging their bets and saying, listen, we're going to open these movies in theaters where they are allowed, but also on HBO Max in the United States over a 30-day window to drive subscribers. And ""Wonder Woman 1984"" is the first movie to try this sort of new strategy. It's this weekend. I've had a chance to see it. It is a movie you want to see on the big screen. It's a superhero film, but obviously, about a third or so of the theaters across the US are not even open. So you'll see an audience of comic book fans seeing this at home on HBO Max this weekend.

Story continues

But it does open the door for this whole holiday season for people to see movies like this at home on streaming. And then, the other studios so far have not been following suit, but we'll have to wait and see.

BRIAN SOZZI: Gitesh, let's stay on the movie theaters. What does the movie theater industry look like after the pandemic?

GITESH PANDYA: It's incredibly challenging. And in my opinion, I think it's about the experience. That's where the theaters have to really push it. They need to offer a bigger and better experience in the theater that you cannot get at home because if one thing that we've seen in 2020, it's that the amount of streaming content has skyrocketed-- not just B-list product, but A-list product. Almost everything is coming at home because of necessity.

So that's a new challenge at theaters have next year. So when it comes to the seats, the food, the concessions, the drinks, live entertainment or live talent doing interactive Q&As, things like that-- anything that theaters can do to up the experience, to make it unique, exciting is going to help.

Also, the premium formats-- IMAX, 4DX-- that's something you can't get at home. So I do think that 2021 is going to be led by the bigger brands, the big action films, the movies that really take advantage of the big screen experience. And over the next two years or so, we'll start seeing some of the smaller films get back as well. But it's going to be the experience, and these theaters have to up their game to get the bodies back into those seats.

JULIE HYMAN: Gitesh, for the movies that are being released streaming-- either streaming only or simultaneously in the theaters-- how do we measure those? Because traditionally you would get box office receipts from the theater companies. You could also do some on-the-ground research. Now, do we just have to rely on the studios or the streaming companies to give us the numbers?

GITESH PANDYA: Well, right. For streaming, it's a new methodology. Is called crossing your fingers. You have to hope that these companies release numbers. Usually, they'll release them on an earnings call at some point where it benefits them-- not on any regular basis. And so for some of these films, there are a lot of streams, a lot of views that are happening, and they will boost them, more from a PR perspective. And as far as the media goes, as far as consumers, we don't know exactly how much of a success each film is. The studios know themselves. They'll share what little they can.

But I think in the broader sense, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix, Amazon, and so on-- they are looking to drive subscribers. And you can do that by having more content, more unique exclusive content, and that's why you're seeing some of these studios who are affiliated with a streaming service push some of their titles to streaming only instead of a theatrical release.

For example, Disney-- they own Pixar. They have the movie ""Soul,"" which was supposed to come out last June in theaters. It got pushed, and now it's coming out on streaming tomorrow. It's a wonderful film. I recommend it. But it's not one of those sort of ""Toy Story"" franchise films which gets pushed until theaters are ready. It's going straight to streaming, and it helps to make Disney Plus a nice value for consumers.

And that's part of the point-- have the content roll in along with TV shows and other sort of items to drive those subscribers. And HBO Max's deal is one of them. But it's a crowded field, and you're going to see a lot of growth in all of these streaming services trying to live side by side with a rebuilding of the theatrical box office in 2021.

BRIAN SOZZI: All right, Gitesh, and Disney has a ton of content coming out next year. As you analyze their slate of content set to come to market, what grade would you put on it?

GITESH PANDYA: Oh, I'd say-- I'd give it an A, A minus. I think they have some terrific titles. 2019 was a banner year for Disney. I don't think we're going to see that again anytime soon. They had ""Avengers Endgame,"" ""Lion King,"" and so on. So for 2021, they still do have major films from the Marvel universe. Obviously, 2020 was the first time in a long time-- 12 years-- where no Marvel films came out. So those fans are hungry and waiting for ""Black Widow"" and more films to come out in 2021.

But you also have Pixar, and you also have the main Disney animation studio coming out with films. They do have ""Raya and the Last Dragon,"" which is a new original film coming out in March. This one will have the same format as ""Mulan,"" meaning it will have a Disney premiere access for $30 option for people who want that. The difference is ""Mulan"" did not play in US theaters. ""Raya"" will open in US theaters. They're hoping that a certain number of theaters will be open and ready to go for those who choose to see it that way. So it'll be a little bit of a hybrid model.

But they have a lot of content in all four quarters, and a lot of the industry will be looking to Disney to sort of lead the way in this charge to come back.

JULIE HYMAN: Gitesh, really quickly-- of the movies that are coming out on Christmas, what's your top recommendation?

GITESH PANDYA: Oh, well, you know, I would say Pixar's ""Soul"" is probably the top one. It's one of those meaning of life kind of films, good for all ages, makes you think. And I plan to see it again. It's a good one.

JULIE HYMAN: That's definitely news I can use in my household. Thank you so much, Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru.

GITESH PANDYA: Thanks.

70,2020-12-21T21:04:00+00:00,"CEOs of Disney, Roku, NexTech AR, Netflix and fubo discuss the new streaming paradigm","New York , Dec.  21, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tech Capital, the trusted source of technology news and analysis, is highlighting recent comments from CEOs at top streaming companies like Disney, Netflix, NextechAR, fuboTV and Roku.

Streaming is reshaping industries at a record pace, from entertainment to events, and challenging the paradigm of long-held business models. Nowhere is this more evident than Warner Media’s game-changing decision to drop its suite of blockbuster new releases onto the HBO Max platform – a big win for the streaming business and sending shockwaves through the establishment in the process.

As 2020 draws to a close, the streaming business is poised to reach new heights. Tech Capital shines the spotlight on comments from leaders who are disrupting the year’s most-watched tech sector.

fuboTV Inc (NYSE:FUBO) David Gandler, co-founder and CEO: “Firmly at the intersection of megatrends”

“Q3 was the strongest quarter in fuboTV’s history, exceeding targets in all of our key metrics: subscription revenue grew 64% year-over-year, ad revenue grew 153% year-over-year and we ended the quarter with an all-time high of 455,000 paid subscribers. A heavy sports calendar, busy news cycle and Hollywood’s fall entertainment season delivered many viewing options for consumers. We continued to grow fuboTV’s premium, personal viewing experience with the launch of new product features and new programming including Disney Media Networks (ABC, ESPN, many more), MLB Network, NBC News Now and more.”

Added Edgar Bronfman Jr, executive chairman, fuboTV: “Our successful public offering in October demonstrated confidence in fuboTV’s strategy, and investor excitement has continued to grow. We believe fuboTV sits firmly at the intersection of three megatrends: the secular decline of traditional TV viewership, the shift of TV ad dollars to connected TVs and online sports wagering, a market which we intend to enter. As a result, we believe our growth opportunities are numerous. Our optimism in the future of fuboTV and the live TV streaming business has never been stronger.”

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-CEOs Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos: “Embracing the shift to streaming entertainment”

“Competition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant. Linear television and other big categories of entertainment, like video games and user-generated content from YouTube and TikTok are all vying for consumers’ attention and are strong drivers of screen time usage. We remain quite small relative to overall screen time.

“This past quarter, we saw the debut of Comcast’s Peacock, which comes on the heels of the launch of HBO Max and Disney+. Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift to streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other players to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to bring the best stories to audiences all over the world.

“We’ll continue to focus on pleasing our members and improving our service as quickly as possible so that we can be everyone's first choice for online entertainment.”

NexTech AR Solutions Corp (CSE:NTAR) (OTCQB:NEXCF) CEO Evan Gappelberg: “The future of events and experiences will be a hybrid model”

NexTech recently announced the launch of ARoom, a collaborative streaming solution with artificial intelligence and augmented reality enhancements. ARoom integrates with NexTech’s existing Virtual Experience Platform (VEP) and its ARitize software-as-a-service offerings, and the company plans to also offer ARoom as a stand-alone service similar to Zoom.

AR and AI functionality will be available throughout the streaming interface, allowing for virtual and hybrid event experiences that break the confines of attendee computers and mobile devices, the company said. Without the need for a third-party provider like Zoom, NexTech will be able to incorporate AR into the streaming experience by utilizing presenter holograms, AR objects, AR filters similar to Snapchat and more.

“We’re thrilled to be adding the ‘ARoom’ streaming platform to our growing portfolio of event and experience management products. Having these technologies in house and built into our platforms will allow us to realize the power of AR features today and into the future as products like AR glasses become widespread. With this new streaming capability NexTech AR is well-positioned to become a leader in the growing virtual events space and is poised to grow rapidly as we move into 2021,” said Evan Gappelberg, CEO of NexTech AR, “The future of events and experiences will be a hybrid model, incorporating both in-person and virtual elements and we’re constantly challenging ourselves to offer our clients products and solutions that aren’t just seamless and easy to use, but really provide a wow factor for event managers and attendees. We believe ‘ARoom’ will be that “wow” and a major game-changer for this industry both on our platform and as a stand-alone product.”

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Chapek: “Audiences embracing high-quality streaming content”

The response from consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. Everywhere that we’ve launched Disney+, audiences have embraced the wide array of high-quality entertainment, both original and library content. I’m pleased to report that, as of the end of the fourth quarter, Disney+ had more than 73 million paid subscribers – far surpassing our expectations in just its first year. And we’re continuing to see positive trends.

Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) CEO Anthony Wood: “Services that are adopting a growth-marketing mindset are winning”

“As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to accelerate the shift of viewing away from traditional linear and pay-TV, we continued to invest in competitive differentiation and execute well against our strategic plan. During the quarter, we achieved a 43% year-over-year active account growth rate and doubled the active account reach of The Roku Channel. Despite continued uncertainties caused by the pandemic, we are pleased with the trajectory of our business and believe that Roku remains well-positioned to help shape the future of television – including TV advertising – around the world.

“An important investment area for Roku is building valuable endemic content marketing and payment capabilities that help content publishers build and monetize large streaming audiences. Services that adopt a growth-marketing mindset and lean into these capabilities are winning.”

71,2020-12-18T21:31:39+00:00,"Sony, Microsoft Offer Cyberpunk Refunds After Player Complaints","(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have taken unusual measures to appease customers unhappy with CD Projekt SA’s Cyberpunk 2077 game, which was released earlier this month and is riddled with bugs, especially in console versions.

For PlayStation players, Sony is offering full refunds for Cyberpunk 2077 and is removing the title, one of the year’s most highly anticipated gaming blockbusters, from the PlayStation Store. Microsoft is also offering refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, “to ensure that every player is able to get the experience they expect on Xbox.”

Sony’s radical move to pull the game “until further notice” came after the console version of Cyberpunk 2077 debuted Dec. 10, following several delays, to reviews calling out problems and an online outcry from players frustrated with its poor performance.

CD Projekt shares shed 12% in Warsaw Friday, erasing most of this year’s gains.

Warsaw-based developer CD Projekt -- best known for 2015’s The Witcher 3, part of a franchise that was turned into a successful Netflix Inc. series -- has offered refunds to any disappointed players, but Sony is going a step further by entirely removing the game from its store. Cyberpunk features Hollywood star Keanu Reeves as an in-game character and has used the actor as its most visible ambassador in the buildup to its release.

CD Projekt, whose shares have plunged 40% since Dec. 4, confirmed Sony’s decision in a regulatory statement. The studio said it was “working hard” to bring its game back to the PlayStation store and that it had discussions with Sony regarding a full refund for all gamers seeking one.

It said that “all copies, whether digital or physical, will continue to receive support and updates” to help fix the game’s teething problems.

Trigon analyst Kacper Kopron said Sony’s decision is one of “worst scenarios” for the company as PlayStation represents two-thirds of the console market. He expects the move may trim estimates for Cyberpunk console sales by 30% to 40%.

Story continues

Erste Group analyst Emil Poplawski cut his recommendation on CD Projekt’s shares to reduce from buy, setting a target price of 280.5 zloty. Analysts at MBank and VTB Capital expect the game to be restored to PlayStation’s store after larger fixes in early 2021.

On Monday, the developers posted a message on Twitter saying they “should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.” But the company had not cleared its offer of a refund with console manufacturers Sony or Microsoft Corp., both of which have stringent refund policies.

This week, many players who requested refunds found themselves out of luck. Sony said it was working to resolve issues with accessing the refund. Microsoft said it has granted refunds to the vast majority of customers who have requested one.

CD Projekt Chief Executive Officer Adam Kicinski was cited as saying by PAP news agency that the gaming studio isn’t currently holding talks with Microsoft about removing Cyberpunk from its Xbox store.

It’s rare for any title to be removed from stores so soon after release. Previous examples include Square Enix Holdings Co.’s Final Fantasy XIV, which was taken offline for an overhaul following its disastrous 2010 launch, and Amazon.com Inc.’s Crucible, yanked from PC stores earlier this year and subsequently canceled.

Cyberpunk’s developers faced intense public pressure to get the game out this year, rising to the level of death threats, as Senior Game Designer Andrzej Zawadzki tweeted in October. Six-day work weeks became the norm in the final months leading up to the eventual release, breaking with previous pledges from CD Projekt leaders that the company would avoid imposing a so-called crunch to hurry a game into existence through overtime.

The company has said it’s continuing work to rectify the issues players are encountering in Cyberpunk 2077 -- and its prior blockbuster, The Witcher 3, improved drastically after its release thanks to downloadable patches.

73,2020-12-18T14:12:03+00:00,Cyberpunk Fiasco Is Going to Make Gaming More Expensive,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Buying a video game these days often feels like flying with a budget airline. By the time you take into account expansion packs, loot boxes and online gaming fees, a game’s sticker price can end up being just a fraction of the ultimate cost.

That’s why game maker CD Projekt SA found a special place in the hearts of gaming enthusiasts. Unlike giant rivals Electronic Arts Inc., Activision Blizzard Inc. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., the Warsaw-based studio made most of its money the old-fashioned way: selling a game that you can fully enjoy without having to keep spending on it.

The strategy helped make its “The Witcher” series a hit — and get adapted into a Netflix show. Over the past five years, the Polish company’s shares jumped 1,800%.

Now the approach seems to have come unstuck.

The stock’s surge had also been driven by the breathless anticipation for “Cyberpunk 2077,” an action role-playing game starring Keanu Reeves that had secured eight million pre-orders. Released last week, players assume the role of an urban mercenary whose abilities are augmented by cyberware implants. But “Cyberpunk” has been beset by poor user reviews and technical glitches, particularly on Sony Corp.’s Playstation console and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

The extent of the problems prompted Sony to pull the game from its online store on Friday. CD Projekt shares fell as much as 22% on the news, extending the decline that investors have endured since Dec. 4. The company is now valued at 25 billion zlotys ($6.8 billion).

It’s a tough pill for gamers and shareholders alike to swallow. “Cyberpunk” was supposed to form the basis for new online services that could bring more predictable revenue. Such services currently account for just 8% of CD Projekt’s annual sales, which had been expected to jump more than fourfold to 2.8 billion zlotys this year. At EA, live services account for 51% of sales, while game purchases are less than 40%, giving the Redwood City, California-based giant more of a cushion should it mess up new title releases.

Story continues

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman estimates it will take CD Projekt three to six months to fix the snafus. Keeping its developers occupied with that could push back the rollout of live services and the recurring revenue they promise.

Unfortunately for gamers, the experience highlights why it’s important for studios to beef up those add-on offerings. If a new release goes wrong and fewer people end up buying the game, that has a bigger impact on earnings if the studio doesn’t have reliable income from live services. CD Projekt’s foul-up of “Cyberpunk 2077” means gaming investors won’t have much patience for the more straightforward sales strategy again.

Going the budget airline route and totting up additional costs is more likely to keep a studio flying high.

75,2020-12-14T12:00:19+00:00,2021’s Must-See Drama: Netflix Under Siege,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When 2020 began and the public didn’t yet know of the coronavirus, the television and entertainment industry was in the midst of a makeshift effort to challenge Netflix Inc., the undisputed leader in streaming. Disney+ and Apple TV+ had just launched, and HBO Max, Peacock and the already dearly departed Quibi were just entering the market. The playbooks were all lacking. The new entrants craved Netflix’s success while resisting how Netflix got there: providing a whole heap of programming unencumbered by a need to support more profitable theatrical or cable-TV businesses.

Then the world changed, and Netflix’s way became the only way.

Streaming was beginning to take over before Covid, but it was playing out in the way a slowly buffering online video does when the connection is strained by too many other devices in use. The industry had other big businesses that needed attention and resources, and it didn’t want to cannibalize them. Then suddenly, all those competing “devices” were shut down, and the focus completely shifted.

Think back to what activities you may have been doing in mid-January. Perhaps grabbing a bite with friends, booking ski vacations or maybe even going to the movies. On the weekend of Jan. 17, 2020, North American theaters sold $62.5 million of tickets to the opening of Sony Pictures’ “Bad Boys for Life,” starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence — not a Marvel superhero smash, but a box-office hit in its own right. The $204 million that it has generated in total so far would have ranked around tenth in a typical year. Instead, the action-comedy threequel — graded 77% on Rotten Tomatoes — is the No. 1 film of 2020, according to data from The Numbers. And it grossed more on that January weekend than the entire box office did in all of November.

Of course, not long after “Bad Boys” hit the big screen, Covid-19 forced theater chains such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the largest in the U.S., to close all locations for what everyone thought would be just a few months, at most. Then a few months became nine. Now they fear permanence. Meanwhile, more than 60 million people have signed up for Disney+, about 30 million for Netflix and nearly 13 million activated the new HBO Max. Netflix has released streaming hit after streaming hit, from “Tiger King” to “The Queen’s Gambit.” And AMC? It warned last week that it will run out of cash by the end of January unless something changes.

Until now, major studios had treaded carefully in their relationships with theater operators because the industry was too important. After all, Disney took a one-third share of the $11.3 billion box office in 2019, while AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., Sony and Comcast Corp.’s Universal split another third. But in the wake of Covid, the companies seem be giving up on cinemas in some ways. Even with a vaccine, theater patronage may never bounce back to the level needed for any entertainment giant to justify prioritizing theaters over streaming. Warner said this month that each film it puts in cinemas next year will immediately become available on the $15-a-month HBO Max app for one month.

Disney is taking a different tack: “Black Widow,” its next Marvel film, will still go to theaters, as will others. But it’s leaning heavily on the lucrative Marvel and Star Wars brands to fuel Disney+ subscriber growth, with 20 new shows from those two franchises alone slated for the next few years. Some of those series probably would have been movies in pre-Covid times. The next Star Wars theatrical film, “Rogue Squadron,” isn’t coming until December 2023.

Both Warner Bros. and Disney’s plans were well-received by their shareholders, despite the price their income statements will pay for these decisions. Disney doesn’t expect any of its streaming apps to begin making money for another couple of years; together they lost $2.8 billion in fiscal 2020. And yet its share have risen 22%, outpacing the S&P 500 index. Theater stocks, on the other hand, have cratered. Cineworld Group Plc — a British operator that acquired U.S. chain Regal in 2018 — has lost 71% in market cap. AMC’s operating losses widened to $675 million last quarter, unable to cover its $94 million of debt interest expense.

The goal for Disney+, HBO Max and the laundry list of other services is to crack lists like Nielsen’s weekly top-10 streaming programs. It tends to look like this — all Netflix, with maybe one show from another service:

It's also not just about amassing hundreds of millions of subscribers paying a monthly fee. (Disney projects at least 300 million by fiscal 2024.) It’s the value of owning the data on all those subscribers. And the elephant in the room is the TV-advertising industry, which is salivating at the opportunity to tap into streaming services (Comcast’s Peacock is already welcoming it). Beyond that, the success of Disney+ and its Star Wars shows, for example, will continue to feed innovations for the theme parks, interest in the cruise ships and purchases of consumer products in the same way Disney’s traditional entertainment businesses have. Think of all the “baby Yoda” sales that came from “The Mandalorian.” For AT&T, CEO John Stankey sees streaming as a way to 2help to keep wireless customers from jumping to other carriers.

When the year began, the financial results for Disney’s streaming operations were relegated to the last section of its quarterly reports — an afterthought to the cable-TV networks, film studios, theme parks, resorts and cruises. The $318 billion company recently reorganized into just two reportable units — Disney Media and Entertainment, and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. The first seems to emphasize streaming above all. CEO Bob Chapek called it a “strategy that puts the consumer in charge.” This was the slide Disney showed investors in explaining the new structure:

Notice where the two people on the left are sitting — not in a theater auditorium, but at home. That may be the most enduring change to come out of 2020. Netflix should enjoy its lonely winter on top, because in 2021 the streaming wars are finally heating up.

Video Transcript

- The entertainment industry has been hit hard by COVID-19, but also the economic slowdown is hitting the industry. We saw the news about Warner Brothers and HBO Max. We're going to talk about all of that. We're going to invite into the stream right now Yahoo Finance entertainment correspondent, Allie Canal, but also want to bring in the SAG-AFTRA president, Gabrielle Carteris.

And let me geek out here real quick. Because in the 1990s, Wednesdays and Thursday nights, I was working at a Fox newsroom. In Indianapolis, we used to watch ""90210"" all the time. So it's a pleasure to have you here and thank you for helping us get through the evening years ago.

GABRILLE CARTERIS: Well thank you so much.

- I want to ask you right now, though-- Yeah. Yeah. I apologize for the little geek moment there.

GABRILLE CARTERIS: No, I thank you so much. Really, I appreciate being here and it was fun time.

- The reason I say that is-- and being an actor is a difficult road. And this issue that-- before we get into COVID-19, we just got the news today about the Directors Actors Guild is responding to the news that one of the movie making, entertainment making companies is going to go direct to stream.

And what people I think fail to realize is that a lot of actors, not just the stars, but the people whose bread and butter is dependent upon residuals that get when these TV shows get paid are being threatened. Is there anything you want to say about that?

GABRILLE CARTERIS: Yeah, well it's actually-- it's the theatrical releases that are being threatened. And this is-- it's not just the DGA speaking out. It's the entire industry. We were-- everybody-- it was something that-- the lack of transparency that occurred has been shocking.

And so right now, we're in the midst of actually investigating what does it mean to our members specifically, but this affects the entire industry. Absolutely. So for us, we know that the way-- we want to make sure that the pay structure of which our members are compensated, it continues.

Story continues

We don't want this switch that's occurred to interfere with the way our members earn their living. So we're really investigating it now. And if you actually call me up in a couple of weeks, I might be able to have a little more insight on it. But everybody in the industry, we all heard at the same time and it was not something that we heard from them directly. So we're dealing with that and trying to investigate what it means.

ALLIE CANAL: Hi Gabrielle. It's Allie Canal here. Good to talk to you again.

GABRILLE CARTERIS: Hi Allie. Good to talk to you.

ALLIE CANAL: So I want to say, what's the temperature check like when it comes to these actors? Because besides the restaurant business, Hollywood has been especially hard hit by COVID-19. All of these changes are happening very rapidly. So what's on the mind of these actors? Are they excited about this new normal? Are they upset that potentially the traditional way of doing things in Hollywood is dying? What is that temperature check?

GABRILLE CARTERIS: Well, the temperature check based on protocols, you mean what's going on with the industry being--

ALLIE CANAL: Well, even with streaming. Is there-- because I feel like as a performer, your dream is to have your film on the big screen, right? Now that seems to be changing.

GABRILLE CARTERIS: You know, it's been changing for a while, right? So streaming is not-- the thing we actually dealt with streaming-- I'm so proud. We knew that there were major shifts occurring. Nobody knew the pandemic was going to happen. We did a major negotiation with incredible increases in streaming for our members, in terms of residuals.

That was just mentioned. So that's really-- you know, between 25%-40%-- 26%-45% increase in residuals. So that was really important regarding streaming. But when you're talking about film going directly to TV without the backend that might be attached to it or whatever, those are the things that we have to look at.

Streaming. Look, we're excited because we actually captured it in our rates for our contract. But we all saw streaming being the thing and the pandemic has shot us all into a streaming universe. So what was gradually developing now has become the norm, and I think that we'll never go back.

So people-- clearly with streaming, there's actually there's been more work available because productions are bundling some of their work. And it's been a very exciting time for actors, but the unknown is always something that we're trying to stay in front of. It's a good time and we'll see what goes on with it.

But we're prepared for that. We have compensation created for our members on that level. It's just what we really have to find out what is the idea between Warner when they're going HBO Max directly without doing the theatrical release. What does that mean for our members because their contracts were created in a certain way for that process. And now if it goes differently, we have to see how that affects them.

ALLIE CANAL: And Gabrielle, last time we spoke back in June, you guys had just enacted those safety procedures, the COVID 19 protocols. Six months later, what have you learned? What's working? What needs to be adjusted now that we learn-- now that we know a little more about this virus.

GABRILLE CARTERIS: Well, we're adjusting all the time. And the virus-- what we're learning is how much we don't know and how much we do. What we've seen, the protocols have been great for us in terms of opening up the business. That was the idea for us, was to be able to open up the business to make it as safe as possible if people decided to go back to work.

And we're seeing that-- which was a study just came out today out of New York, showing that less than 0.02% or 2/10 of a percent of any kind of infection is really occurring on sets due to the protocols. So I know that there's a really good thing occurring in terms of hopefully being able to keep the business open for our members.

But you're right. Our members were the hardest hit. Anybody in the performance universe, we were the first to be shut down. And now, we're hoping we're going to be able to stay open. But we have to see how it goes. We're really saying to our members look, we've created protocols to make the safest way back but you have to be comfortable.

If you're not comfortable, you know, then please don't go and seek out work right now. We are not here to push it, but we want to make it available to those people who want to work and hopefully, that they can stay working. But it's been-- we are-- actually every month, we're coming back.

We're re-evaluating. We have committees. We're dealing with the other unions with the studios, and we're doing it on a regular basis, reevaluating where can we do better. But the three times a week right now of testing has been some of our best, I think, best protocols so far.

78,2020-12-05T19:52:15+00:00,Analyst: Here's why Warner Bros' HBO Max bombshell won't be the death knell for movies,"On Thursday, Warner Bros. (T) shocked the media landscape by announcing plans to air all of its 2021 movies on HBO Max — the same day the films hit theaters.

Shares of the major theater chains plummeted on the news, as fears rippled across the industry that cinemas aren’t just dying — they’re being “murdered” at the hands of COVID-19 and the at-home streaming boom.

But is it really the end of the industry as we know it? Maybe not quite yet, according to one analyst.

“We don’t think the industry is dead, rather we think [streaming and theaters are] playing very well together,” Macquarie Analyst Chad Beynon told Yahoo Finance.

“If we take a look at the results of 2018 and 2019, movie theater revenue and profits were significant for the five major studios,” Beynon said. He added Disney’s (DIS) box office performance was especially impressive, with over $11 billion generated in 2019.

For platforms like Disney, the movie-going experience “is really the first channel of these later channels like theme parks, characters and at-home content,” he explained.

“So we still think the theater experience and economic model make sense for the studios, especially for the blockbusters,” he added. “I don’t think you’ll be able to replace those revenues and profits in the at-home market alone.”

‘Urgent dialogue’ Just this past week, AMC filed with the SEC to offer 200 million shares in order to raise $844 million to avoid bankruptcy

However, the immediate threat facing theaters is very real, and time is running out for chains like AMC (AMC) to avoid bankruptcy. Just this past week, the company filed with the SEC to offer 200 million shares in order to raise $844 million.

But the filing was quickly overshadowed by WarnerMedia’s announcement, which Beynon said now “adjusts the risks of investing at this point.”

AMC CEO Adam Aron released a statement on Thursday night, saying, “Clearly, WarnerMedia intends to sacrifice a considerable portion of the profitability of its movie studio division, and that of its production partners and filmmakers, to subsidize its HBO Max startup.”

Story continues

He added: “We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business. We have already commenced an immediate and urgent dialogue with the leadership of Warner on this subject.”

In the interim, AMC might have to adjust its post-COVID return as specialized, higher-end experiences could reign supreme.

“I think consumers — particularly in this industry — will pay for service and higher quality and that’s something that IMAX (IMAX) and some of these other players have done well,” Beynon said.

“This whole industry has changed in terms of what’s being offered to the consumer — luxury recliners, food and beverage options — and IMAX is the luxury bar here,” the analyst noted.

“They’re doing well in China and Japan and we’ve seen consumers flock back to those screens because they’re choosing to go there over other products in the market. I think that will be the same case in the U.S.,” he added.

IMAX shares rebounded from its Thursday losses — closing nearly 4% higher at Friday’s close whereas AMC continued to lag in the red, ending the week down over 3%.

“AMC has a mix of higher-end and lower-end products but I do believe when consumers come back and have the opportunity to go to the big screen, they’re going to choose quality and service over anything else,” Beynon concluded.

SEANA SMITH: Big news in the streaming space and for movie owners, Warner Brothers announcing this week that they will release their entire slate of movies for next year simultaneously in theaters while also on HBO Max. We want to bring in Dan Roberts, because of course, he's closely tracking this story here at Yahoo Finance for us. And Dan, I think the big question is, movie theaters, they've been losing ground now to streamers even before the pandemic. But how much trouble could they be in at this point?

DAN ROBERTS: Well, it's a major problem, Seana. And this is sort of just the latest salvo in what I think it's increasingly fair to call a war between the studios and the exhibitors, as theaters are called. Now, I've seen people point out that in a way, Warner Brothers here, Warner Media, and AT&T, by extension, they're really just using the pandemic as a cover in order to screw theaters. I don't think that's going too far. The company has given a caveat that the plan is to just have these Warner Brothers movies be on HBO Max for the first month. So that is, when every movie comes out, it'll go on HBO Max and in theaters simultaneously, but after the first month, it'll leave HBO Max, and it'll continue to run in theaters.

The problem with that is, if you want to see one of these movies, you're going to see it in the first month. People don't wait longer than a month to see a movie that they want to see. So it certainly hurts theaters. And really, what we're talking about here, is the potential death of the theatrical window. Traditionally, movies and theaters, studios and theaters have had an agreement that movies go into theaters exclusively for 70 days. Theaters are the only place in the first 70 days that you can watch the movie.

AMC has already come to an agreement with Universal that shrinks the theatrical window for Universal movies to just 17 days. But this plan for Warner media throws the theatrical window out of the window. Because there's no exclusivity for the theaters. So it's really an effort to boost subscriptions for HBO Max, and I think in some way, it's spurred by the pandemic. But it's also the company reacting to what it thinks consumers want, which is convenience, we want to watch movies right away, at home, when they come out.

For me, as a lover of movie theaters, I'm a little saddened by this news, and I think if Disney follows Warner Brothers, then this is a major, major, major problem. Maybe even a death knell for theater chains.

ADAM SHAPIRO: Dan, you can probably put money that Disney will follow. The consolidation we saw yesterday and the layoffs in the entertainment division sure hints that that's where they're headed. But I've got to ask you, the implications of this are greater than just the theater stocks going down. I could imagine, for instance, people are going to need bigger monitors to watch-- they're going to want bigger monitors to watch movies. So what are the-- this could be 10-fold on itself. The Oscars will change. It all changes, right?

DAN ROBERTS: I agree with you. We can extend out the tentacles here to any angle you want. People are going to buy bigger TVs, sure. Also, the awards rules have to change. That was already a major discussion before the pandemic. Remember, ""The Irishman"" had to go into theaters for 14 days just to be eligible for Oscars. That's all going to go away.

Now, let me just say, to your point about Disney, I'm not so sure that Disney would follow suit with Warner Brothers here. I think we should see what Warner Media is doing in 2021 as an experiment, because you'll remember that Disney put ""Mulan"" straight on Disney Plus for a $30 digital purchase fee. That's in addition to having to be a Disney Plus subscriber, and by all accounts, it wasn't a huge success. Now maybe that was because the reviews of ""Mulan"" weren't great, maybe that was because of the political controversy around ""Mulan,"" but I don't think that was a huge success. And Disney hasn't really shared any numbers, and I think there's good reason for that.

So we'll see if Disney does that once the pandemic is over. But certainly, if Warner Media has success in 2021 with seeing its movies on HBO Max, it's going to be a problem for theaters.

SEANA SMITH: Dan, talking about this clearly just highlights the power of streaming and how different the landscape is today than it was even just a year ago. And I know you have a new story out just about the three most popular streaming shows right now, including ""The Undoing,"" which is on HBO Max, which is what we have been talking about. But what does this tell us just about the strength of each of these streaming services, and how we compare them to each other?

DAN ROBERTS: Yeah, Seana. We've got data from a lot of different services and streaming information sites that basically show that in the last two weeks, the cultural conversation in TV is mainly around these three shows. And it's no surprise what they are. It's ""The Mandalorian"" season two on Disney Plus, it's ""The Undoing"" on HBO Max, and it's ""Queen's Gambit"" on Netflix.

Now what's most interesting to me here is how unsurprising the success of these shows are. Each show is basically textbook representative of the platform it's on. ""The Undoing"" is a realist-- you know, it exists in the real world, about adults, domestic thriller, and it's very HBO. In many ways, it's very ""Big Little Lies"", which has been a huge hit for HBO. ""Queen's Gambit"" is a high gloss, premium, fancy, measured period piece, that in many ways, I think, feels like ""The Crown."" It's about chess, it's about the 1950s and '60s, and it's very Netflix. And then you've got ""The Mandalorian"", which is still the only big original series that Disney Plus has had, but that's enough. It only needed one. I mean, Baby Yoda has become a cultural conversation. Disney doesn't need other shows right now.

And my prediction is that the excitement and conversation around ""Queen's Gambit"" is going to be short lived, because any day, there will be another big Netflix original series hit, and I think that's OK. Netflix's strategy is very kitchen sinky. I mean, you guys, remember ""Tiger King,"" which was a huge cultural conversation? That was already months and months ago. That was March!

Since then, we've cycled through Netflix hit after hit after hit, and that's just what the company does, and what it wants moving forward. It doesn't need really one tentpole show. It has a number of short lived, giant hits.

ADAM SHAPIRO: Yeah, isn't that going to be the recipe for success? And I just got to correct you on ""Queen's Gambit."" Just the cars alone. The shots of the period cars from the '50s and '60s is worth it. But isn't that the key? Because who wants to wait-- I got to wait till 2023, I think, or '22 to get season four of ""Ozark.""

So isn't that the way to do it? Do one season, seven or eight episodes, have a hit, then go on to the next project.

DAN ROBERTS: Well again, Adam. Ozark's been successful, but look at ""Queen's Gambit."" It's a limited series, meaning that the show is over. There won't be a season two. Netflix does a little of everything. Remember the reality show, ""The Indian Matchmaking Show."" That was a huge success. Everyone was watching that. That was already months and months ago. Remember ""Love is Blind?"" That was a mega success. Everyone was talking about it. That already feels like an eternity ago.

Netflix, the way it does things with the amount of cash it invests in these original programs, it can stand to have hits that two months after they've aired, no one's talking about anymore. So soon enough, we'll be talking about the next one.

Disney, it's a real long term approach using Disney's own IP, Star Wars spinoffs. And look at the list of the other original shows that are coming soon to Disney Plus. They're all Marvel and Star Wars spinoff shows. And that's OK. Two very different strategies.

ADAM SHAPIRO: So much for Quibi.

SEANA SMITH: And Dan, as you were talking, I realize that there's-- I think that there's just so much content out there, and it's almost impossible to keep up with at this point. They have only seen about 10% of the shows that you mentioned, so I certainly know at least some of my plans of what I'm going to do this weekend.

SEANA SMITH: Big news in the streaming space and for movie owners, Warner Brothers announcing this week that they will release their entire slate of movies for next year simultaneously in theaters while also on HBO Max. We want to bring in Dan Roberts, because of course, he's closely tracking this story here at Yahoo Finance for us. And Dan, I think the big question is, movie theaters, they've been losing ground now to streamers even before the pandemic. But how much trouble could they be in at this point?

DAN ROBERTS: Well, it's a major problem, Seana.

On Dec. 21, Tesla stock will be added to the S&P 500 index as by far the most valuable company ever. Tesla (TSLA) badge on back end of red Tesla car

Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com

The S&P 500 index is the most popular index of U.S. stocks. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is by far the largest ETF in the world by assets under management.

I am among many skeptics that believe Tesla is a great company but has a stock price that has been caught in a bubble for more than a year now. As an S&P 500 index ETF investor myself, I am concerned about the danger Tesla could pose to the S&P 500 once the bubble bursts.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Tesla Stock and the S&P 500

The S&P 500 is a collection of 500 of the largest US-listed stocks. The index is market cap-weighted, meaning the formula used to calculate its price is based on the market caps of the component companies.

7 Growth Stocks Flying Under the Radar

A stock’s weighting in the index is calculated by dividing a company’s individual market cap by the total market caps of all 500 companies in the index.

After gaining 785% in the last year, Tesla’s market cap is now around $550 billion. At its current valuation, Tesla is nearly three times larger than the largest stock ever added to the S&P 500.

The fact that Tesla’s valuation is so high yet it hasn’t been eligible for the S&P 500 until this year is extremely telling. Tesla needed to put together a string of four quarters of profitability to gain eligibility. After 17 years, it finally hit that profitability mark this year.

Investors have never valued an unprofitable company anywhere near the levels Tesla is valued now. Not Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) or any other auto stock in history. Not Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or any other tech stock in history.

Tesla’s Initial Weighting

Story continues

There’s a good chance Tesla could continue to rally to new highs between now and its Dec. 21 addition date. That rally would only add to the company’s bloated market cap. It could also potentially create even more problems with its inclusion.

However, for now let’s assume Tesla is added at a market cap of around $550 billion. It would immediately have the sixth-largest weighting in the S&P 500.

As an owner of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VOO) myself, here’s what that means for me. Overnight, I will go from having no part of Tesla in my portfolio to Tesla being my sixth-largest holding.

Here’s why that’s a problem. Back on May 1, Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously said “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

I often disagree with Musk, but this time I think he got it right. Regardless, Tesla shares have skyrocketed another 317% in seven months since that tweet.

That price Musk said was “too high” now represents a split adjusted price of around $152. In other words, it represents about 74% downside from current levels. And remember, this is not the rantings of a crazy Tesla short seller. This is the price Musk himself said was too high earlier this year.

Back in September, I compared Tesla’s valuation to other auto stocks and high-growth tech stocks and arrived at a reasonable valuation of $141. That number is roughly in-line with the level Musk said was too high.

That level represents about 76% downside, so Musk and I seem to be on the same page. Tesla could easily have 70% to 80% downside when the bubble bursts. And before any Tesla bulls leave me angry comments about that target, remember I’m just agreeing with Musk.

How Much Could a Tesla Crash Hurt?

Tesla is a divisive stock. Plenty of people are believers and plenty of people are skeptics. But pretty much every American with money invested for retirement has significant exposure to the S&P 500. I want to know just how much the bursting of the Tesla bubble could hurt my VOO ETF investment.

The S&P 500’s total market cap is somewhere in the neighborhood of $32 trillion. Assuming Tesla would overshoot to the downside a bit if the stock crashes, how much of an impact would an 85% drop in Tesla’s share price have on the S&P 500 as a whole?

At current prices, 85% of Tesla’s market cap is worth about $460 billion. Crunching the numbers, $460 billion divided by $32 trillion is about 1.4%. So Tesla could potentially drag down the S&P 500 by around 1.4% all by itself.

Bigger Than Tesla

Of course, in reality the fallout of a Tesla stock crash would likely be much worse given the pain it would inflict on so many investors. There would certainly be ripple effects on other stocks.

I think there’s a good chance the S&P 500 inclusion will mark the ultimate top in Tesla stock for at least the next several years. However, as an S&P 500 index ETF investor, I’m hoping that top will simply mark the beginning of a decade of underperformance for Tesla rather than a volatile bubble-bursting event that could drag down the rest of the market.

83,2020-12-03T21:47:37+00:00,'Dune' at Home Turns Theaters Into Wasteland,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warner Bros. and HBO Max, two units of AT&T Inc., just delivered a crushing blow to movie theaters. All of the studio’s films set for release next year — including “The Suicide Squad,” “Dune” and “The Matrix 4” — will go straight to the HBO Max streaming service at the same time that they play in cinemas. While Warner executive Ann Sarnoff sees it as a “unique one-year plan,” let’s be honest, it’s not.

Even as Covid-19 vaccines near approval, it could be a while before consumers feel safe returning to the close confines of a shut-in movie theater. In the latest Morning Consult poll of 2,200 U.S. adults conducted in the final days of November, 51% said it would be four to six months or even longer before they’d feel comfortable resuming trips to the movies; another 26% said they didn’t know or didn’t have an opinion on it. By the time most people do feel safe going, many still may not want to. What I wrote in October — as exhibitor AMC Entertainment Inc. warned of possible bankruptcy — bears repeating:

We have learned to live without movie theaters. Even the ones that make it through the crisis may find that online-streaming apps have stolen away audiences for good.

Unlike amusement-park rides and cruises, which have been equally paralyzed by the pandemic, the movie experience can be replicated at home — and sometimes more cheaply and conveniently. It will be that much harder for theater chains to bounce back.

The place cinemas have in our culture and history, and the thousands of jobs they provide, makes it all the more tragic. But consumers keep signaling that going to the movies is more of an occasional treat when there’s a must-see blockbuster film than a regular habit. That’s not enough to support 40,449 movie screens in the U.S., the latest total published by the National Association of Theater Owners. As I noted in October, higher ticket prices have helped give the false sense that box-office sales are climbing, when in fact adjusting for inflation shows that they’ve gradually fallen over the last 20 years:

Companies such as AT&T and Walt Disney Co. are responding as they must by going where audiences are. And that’s at home. The box office is a crucial source of profit for the Hollywood giants, but prioritizing that over streaming will only hurt them in the long run as Netflix Inc. rounds the corner on 200 million subscribers. The first domino fell in July, when Comcast Corp.’s Universal Studios struck an agreement with AMC to cut short the time its films play exclusively at theaters. Then Disney, the single most important company to movie-theater businesses, bypassed them and put “Mulan” directly on Disney+ in September for a viewing fee of $30. Last week, I wrote that Disney+ would be smart to offer a “box-office pass” subscription tier for movie fans willing to pay up for continuing virtual access to new theatrical releases. HBO Max, which costs $15 a month, won't charge anything extra for its films, for now at least.

Shares of AT&T popped slightly on its announcement Thursday, while AMC and Cinemark Holdings Inc. plunged 16% and 22%, respectively. Just beforehand, as my colleague Brian Chappatta noted, AMC’s most-traded bonds had rallied to 35 cents, up from only 5 cents in early November.

As for Disney and its peers, streaming has been a money-losing venture so far. But the fastest way to start turning a profit is to sign up lots of people. And Netflix has shown that the way to do that is to flood them with content — all the better if it’s movie-theater-quality films. Now that Warner Bros. is planning to do just that in 2021, it’s hard to imagine them turning back.

HBO Max, which costs $15 a month, won't charge anything extra for its films, for now at least.

Shares of AT&T popped slightly on its announcement Thursday, while AMC and Cinemark Holdings Inc. plunged 16% and 22%, respectively. Just beforehand, as my colleague Brian Chappatta noted, AMC’s most-traded bonds had rallied to 35 cents, up from only 5 cents in early November.

As for Disney and its peers, streaming has been a money-losing venture so far. But the fastest way to start turning a profit is to sign up lots of people. And Netflix has shown that the way to do that is to flood them with content — all the better if it’s movie-theater-quality films. Now that Warner Bros. is planning to do just that in 2021, it’s hard to imagine them turning back.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: America is in the midst of a racial reckoning, fresh off of a wave of protests in the summer and a divisive election in the fall. With tensions at a boil, opponents dig in, and dialogue stops. Emmanuel Acho wants to keep the conversation going. The Fox Sports host and former NFL linebacker invites people, especially white people, to talk about race on his YouTube show, ""Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.""

His 65 million views and counting have made the show an instant success. And with help from Oprah Winfrey, he just released a book by the same title. On this episode of ""Influencers,"" Emmanuel Acho joins me to talk about which questions white people are afraid to ask, why he rejects cancel culture, and whether the perception of the NFL will change after the Trump presidency.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Emmanuel Acho, who is a former NFL player, host of Fox Sports 1 ""Speak For Yourself,"" and author of the new book, ""Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man."" Emmanuel, great to see you.

EMMANUEL ACHO: Andy, good to be seen. Good to be talking to you, my friend.

ANDY SERWER: Thank you. So you started this off, conversations-- ""Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man"" as a YouTube show, and it amassed more than 65 million views from when you started it in June. What were you hoping to achieve when you started that, and why do you think it's resonated so widely?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Man, great question, Andy. I was hoping to act as a bridge for racial reconciliation. Andy, I went to an affluent white school from grades five through 12, and I was immersed in white culture. But then, Andy, I got offered a scholarship to play football at the University of Texas, and then I go to the NFL. So now I'm immersed in Black culture.

Story continues

Andy, what I've realized is there is a communication difference between white people, white culture, and Black people, Black culture. Because I've been immersed in both cultures, I understand, Andy, there is a difference. And that communication barrier is playing a factor in our racial tension right now, a huge factor. Sure, we all speak English. But make no mistake about it, there are differences in ways we communicate and interpret things.

So I said, you know what, Andy? I'm going to preemptively answer questions that I know my white brothers and sisters have but either are too afraid to ask or don't have a Black person to ask or Black people to ask, such as, wait a second, how come white people can't say the n-word but Black people can? Wait, Emmanuel, but what about Black-on-Black crime in Chicago? OK, what's this concept of white privilege?

But Emmanuel, what about reverse racism? Black people get a Black History Month. White people don't get a White History Month. OK, but isn't affirmative action just the same thing as, like, the Jim Crow laws? So I preemptively said, you know what, Andy? Let me answer so many of these questions that are leaving my white brothers and sisters in ignorance.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, and then you turned it into this book right here, which has been really resonating with people as well. And I've been-- I'm in the midst of it right now, and I love the question format. Because you're right, so many people-- white people-- are asking those questions right now, Emmanuel. And-- so are you getting the kind of responses that you hoped to? In other words, are people saying, oh, you know, now I do understand? And how are you--

EMMANUEL ACHO: Oh.

ANDY SERWER: --getting that communicated to you?

EMMANUEL ACHO: I love that. I really am, Andy. And the best response I got was week one into the episode-- it was a sweet woman named Lynn, 73-year-old white woman. She said dear Emmanuel, I grew up in the South in rural Alabama in the '40s and '50s. I didn't go to school with any Negroes, she said. But after watching your episode, I realized my heart still needs to change. Please don't give up on me yet. I love you, my brother and my son.

And Andy, after I got that email, I said, wait a second. The hearts are changing. Hearts are turning. This isn't about clicks. This isn't about likes. This isn't about shares. This is about influencing this generation and the next generation.

So let's write a book, which can be passed down from generation to generation and affect true, meaningful change. I don't just want the spoken word, which is sizzle. I need the written word, which is substantive. And that's what will really make a change.

So the appetite, Andy, has been insatiable it seems like. The more I give people, the more they want. Emmanuel, make the episodes longer. I wish you could expand on this. And so that's how we're going right now.

ANDY SERWER: You know, on the one hand, we're seeing white and Black people come together. But unfortunately, it's on one side of the political aisle. You know, you're seeing a lot of white people at Black Lives Matters protests, more than a lot of people anticipated, you know, in Connecticut and Michigan and Pennsylvania. On the other hand, you have the Proud Boys, a lot of Trump supporters who might not see eye to eye with this still. How can we bring this country together?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, I would say the first thing, Andy, is we all have to collectively get out of denial. I said this before to Oprah when her and I were talking. Denial, spelled D-E-N-I-A-L-- don't even know I am lying. And you can't fix a problem, Andy, that you don't know exists.

So how can we all collectively move forward? Acknowledge a problem exists. You mentioned it at the top of this. I'm a sports guy. Let me talk sports with y'all real quick. In the NFL, the reason that so many people can be of different races, different religions, different backgrounds, Andy, and still come together is because they're fighting a common enemy.

When I walk out onto the field, which is 53 and 1/3 wide and 100 yards long, I remember that, wait a second, me and my brother to my left and my right are fighting a common enemy. So I don't care what my brother looks like. I don't care who my brother worships Because we're on a goal to beat the opponent.

In America, Andy, we haven't yet realized we're fighting a common enemy of oppression. We're fighting a common enemy of racism. We're fighting a common enemy of systemic injustice. And as a result, we're bickering with our brothers and sisters to our left and our right instead of realizing, no, it's us versus oppression. It's not Black versus white. It's not white versus Black. It's good versus evil. It's love versus hate.

ANDY SERWER: Do you think we can get there? I mean, well, let me hold that one for a second. Social media-- I mean, a lot of people are suggesting that's making the situation-- the divisiveness worse. What's your take on that?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Social media does two things. It can make the divisiveness worse because it gives everyone a platform, and they can also hide. And so it gives people a platform that-- but they can also maintain anonymity, and that's the worst part. Like, if everyone on social media had to put their actual first and last name, it'd be a completely different agenda.

But social media also has some pros. Again, my-- this-- my show, my concept, my book, it wouldn't have occurred without social media. And I know that that has done plenty of good. So with social media, you have to understand, there's bad, but there is also some good involved.

ANDY SERWER: All right, let's get back to that other question, Emmanuel. How optimistic are you about this systemic change that we're trying to undertake?

EMMANUEL ACHO: I'm optimistic, Andy, because I finally realized that hearts are ready to change and that it's not so much that I finally realized. The hearts are finally ready to change. After the murder of George Floyd, Andy, it was as though our white brothers and sisters were like, wait a second, maybe Black people haven't been lying this whole time. Maybe there is a problem. Maybe, like, this racial injustice and racially-motivated incidents-- maybe it's not just a coincidence.

And so I think the harshness of that tragedy of George Floyd, it woke everyone up. And now it's just a matter of-- now that people are awake and now that the intentions are there, is there direction? See, Andy, intention without direction is meaningless. So there's now intention. And I, with this book and with my series, I'm trying to give people direction.

ANDY SERWER: I hear you there. Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has criticized NFL players. Do you think the perception of the league and its players will shift after Donald Trump leaves office?

EMMANUEL ACHO: It's a good question. I think that the perception of the players-- I don't know that it's so much affected by the presidency. What I mean by that is one man nor one woman should be able to dictate your feelings and emotions on oppression, injustice, and racism. Like, these are historical contexts with generational meanings.

So what one person tells you, whether it's Emmanuel Acho, whether it's a president, whoever it is, that shouldn't completely dictate your feelings about something. Do your homework. Do your research. Let your own empathy be created through your own understanding. So I don't think one person can single-handedly dictate the emotions about an-- about a collective system or organization.

ANDY SERWER: You've said the NFL has the right intentions but needs to take it in the right direction. What concrete steps do you think the NFL should take to support the fight for racial justice?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, the first thing is everybody has to understand the fight. I sat down with commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Yeah, he's the commissioner. But to a degree, he can have all the authority and no power at times.

Remember, there are 32 organizations, 32 different cities-- different teams, not 32 different cities but enough different cities. The need in the different cities is different. So it can't be just one one-size-fits-all type of mantra. The need in Dallas is different than the need in Los Angeles, which is different than the need in Phoenix or Glendale, Arizona.

The individual owners have to collectively realize, what does my city need? But how does that start? It starts by talking to your players. Roger Goodell said, yeah, I heard about the injustice, but it wasn't until I went on a ride-along that I really understood it.

These owners, they're hearing things. Oh, I see my players are kneeling, raising a fist. But do they really understand it? It has to go from head knowledge to heart knowledge.

ANDY SERWER: And when you had Roger Goodell on, Emmanuel, I think it was in August, he offered an apology to Colin Kaepernick. But Colin Kaepernick still has not been signed by a team. Is this collusion? Do you think he'll ever go back to the NFL?

EMMANUEL ACHO: No, I don't think Colin Kaepernick will play in the NFL, but there are so many variables to this. What do I mean by that? In the NFL, every organization runs a cost-benefit analysis. How much will it cost us to have you on our organization, and how much will you benefit us?

So if you're an NFL organization, especially four years removed, in regards to Colin Kaepernick, now you're weighing the risk-reward. OK, he'll come in, and obviously, he'll be anywhere from a second to a third-string quarterback right now. Is having Colin Kaepernick as the second or third-string quarterback worth the questions that every player will now get asked, that we will now get asked, and is it worth the distraction that the media will create-- not Colin Kaepernick necessarily, but the media will create.

So because of that, I don't think that Colin Kaepernick would get signed. I also think that-- I don't know, sometimes there's an impasse. Remember, let's talk Cam Newton for a second. Cam Newton didn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wanted to be a starter. And as a result, there was only one team that wanted to make him a starter.

Eric Reid, someone who has been proudly known to be standing by Colin Kaepernick, very justifiably so, the Washington Football Team, they offered him a place on their practice squad. Eric Reid turned it down because Eric Reid views himself as a starter. And so just because you want to play doesn't necessarily mean that the position that will be offered to you that you do, in fact, want. So become about the nuances regarding that, I personally don't see Colin Kaepernick playing in the NFL.

ANDY SERWER: So was the situation where the owners didn't want him for a while and now Father Time has entered into the equation as well a little bit, perhaps, too.

EMMANUEL ACHO: I would say it's a combination of everything. It's the owners don't want what the media will bring with that, number one. And number two, this is so detailed and it's so multifaceted. But until the owners can also get their fans to understand it wasn't about disrespecting the flag, it was about a just cause, then the owners, who are always worried about bottom line, who are always worried about their dollars now are going to run the risk of losing their dollars for the sake of Colin Kaepernick. And unfortunately, owners just aren't that selfless. Like, you don't become a billionaire by being selfless. That's not how it works.

ANDY SERWER: And as you were saying too, Emmanuel, different cities, different owners, different politics, it's all--

EMMANUEL ACHO: Correct.

ANDY SERWER: --part of that equation, as you said. You mentioned the 32 owners. Only two of them are people of color, and only three non-interim head coaches are Black. Wow. It seems like there's a long way to go there, too, right?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, but the issue, Andy, is that so many people think the NFL is a meritocracy. However hard you work, you'll earn your success. It's not. It's really based off nepotism and cronyism. Nepotism, you hire your family. And cronyism, you hire your friends.

Historically, if the NFL was founded by white men and white men are hiring their family-- nepotism, white men. They're hiring their friends-- cronyism, white men. So how do you think that the NFL will change if it's historically founded by white men who are looking out for other white men? It won't.

And so that's why it's not a coincidence when you see only three out of 32 coaches full time who began the season or whatever the statistic may be are Black. That's not a coincidence. That's just the way in which our world at large works, and the NFL is a reflection of that.

ANDY SERWER: You're talking about these owners, these white men, and a vast majority of their political donations went to Republicans. And some of those politicians-- or many of them-- criticized the racial justice protests, including kneeling by NFL players. So this is just part of the politics. You have a lot of Black players and a lot of owners who are white and have, let's just say, not such progressive political perspectives, correct?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, that's part of the-- the real problem is just a lack of understanding. And that's what-- all of this all boils down to-- the nucleus, the crux of the issue is a lack of understanding. Remember, Roger Goodell, he, for so long, said, I didn't realize what the players were kneeling about.

Like, Colin Kaepernick, he definitely took some missteps, definitely. He would admit that, I would assume. Like, wearing the pig socks? Not a great idea. But at the heart of his issue was protesting systemic injustice and police brutality. What have we seen come to a head in 2020? Police brutality and systemic injustice.

So it-- but it just now took Roger Goodell four years to realize what's really been going on. So imagine how many other people who haven't realized that. Roger Goodell is one of the savviest, smartest, wisest businessmen you'll come across, and he didn't realize what it was about. So how can you expect other people to have figured it out by now? Again, it's all just a communication thing and, to a degree, a denial thing.

ANDY SERWER: Is it hypocritical if owners who, on one hand, support Donald Trump over here and on the other hand, make donations to, say, social justice causes? Or is that just-- is that OK? Can you do that?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, I don't think it's hypocritical. Again, support who you support. You have to figure out your motivation for your support, but I will never tell someone what to do. I will tell them why I do what I do and why I think what I do is right. But I'm-- I can't criticize or crucify people for supporting who they support.

I would wonder their intentions behind it, and I would ask them the why. But I won't come out and blanketly offer a general statement of you shouldn't support this person or you should support that person. It's really just understanding why you're doing what you're doing.

ANDY SERWER: I'm going to leave the NFL and go over to the WNBA, OK? And ask you about Kelly Loeffler, who is a Republican senator from Georgia who owns the Atlanta Dream, who has criticized Black Lives Matters' protesters. Do you think that league should remove her as an owner?

EMMANUEL ACHO: I don't think cancel culture, which is what that is essentially alluding to, is ever positive. Because if you cancel somebody, you don't give them the opportunity to grow. You don't give them the opportunity to mature. You don't give them the opportunity to evolve.

I think that group-- I think the WNBA should educate her. Now, if she is refusing, like anyone, education, at that point in time, you have to figure out decisions to make. Again, I don't know all the nuances beyond-- with that case, but I don't believe in cancel culture. I believe in education, which breeds growth.

Again, there is a difference between Black Lives Matter the noun, the group, and Black lives matter the adjective, simply saying that Black people's lives do, in fact, matter. You will not and you have not ever heard of Emmanuel Acho speak about Black Lives Matter, the group. What I speak about is saying that Black lives do, in fact, matter. And so I don't believe in canceling people, to answer your question, because there's no growth there.

ANDY SERWER: Right, makes sense. Let me ask you a little bit about college football and whether the players there should be paid. And some people have compared them not being paid, which is-- and they're largely Black players, to sort of a slavery system, or at least being insensitive. Is that right to say?

EMMANUEL ACHO: It's a little hyperbolic-- probably a lot of hyperbolic-- to compare really anything the slavery. The comparison is having workers make minimal to no money while those whom they are working for are benefiting severely off the labor of the employees. As-- it's really the same parallel that's been drawn in the NFL. You have your owners making billions of dollars, and your players, on average, are making $800,000.

Well, you're making $800,000. How could you compare this to slavery? Because look at $800,000 compared to $1 billion, right? That would be-- what, $0.008 or something like that onto the dollar, or $0.00, whatever the case may be. And so it's always hyperbolic when you're making the slavery comparison, but I do think that college players should be paid.

ANDY SERWER: Right, it's just-- it's inequity, whether it's inequity in college or the NFL. What about corporate America, Emmanuel? What can business people learn from sports, in terms of addressing racial injustice?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Business people can learn to create the common goal. What is the common goal? And you don't even have to think about football. Think about the Olympics. That's something we all get behind.

At the Olympics, you'll see people decked out in their USA gear and whatnot cheering on athletes that they don't know-- women's soccer, men's soccer, track and field. Why? Because they're all banding behind the country to win over another country. You figured out the common opponent. What corporations can realize is, wait a second, what is our common goal? And let's all, as a company, get behind our common goal. That's the only way people can look past their differences.

ANDY SERWER: Emmanuel, what about this crazy new business of yours, which is being a sportscaster, right? I mean, that's got to have its own foibles, problems, issues when it comes to race?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, the-- really, for being a sportscaster is just making sure you don't get boxed in. That's where the beautiful part of me being the host currently with my co-host, another Black man by the name of Marcellus Wiley-- as a former football player, they will just make you an analyst. You're just-- you've got to be an analyst. Break down the tape.

You don't see a lot of Black hosts on TV. I think Marcellus and I might be the first combination of Black hosts for a national show on a daily basis. You don't see a ton of Black hosts. And so for me, it's just a matter of not ever getting boxed in because of my former profession or because of my race.

ANDY SERWER: I used to watch Marcellus Wiley right up the road here. I'm talking to you from Manhattan. He played at Columbia--

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: --right? Right up here. He was a fantastic football player in the Ivy League, and he was one of the few to get to the NFL, right?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Absolutely, and he'll tell you about it every time he gets the chance. But Marcellus Wiley, he's one of those who really-- he put his value on education, and you're seeing the dividend, having just as successful a career after football as he ever did in football.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, some people have criticized, you know, ESPN for-- which is-- you used to work there-- for sticking to sports and not getting into politics. I mean, it's got to be tougher now to do sports than it was, you know, five or 10 years ago where you could just-- you didn't have to pay attention to the social issues at all, right?

EMMANUEL ACHO: It's tougher to do everything now. The world we live in is just so incredibly sensitive, and people are waiting with stones in hand to cancel you based on one wrong word, one wrong sentence, one wrong thought, one wrong statistic. So you have to be even more careful.

But Andy, I believe to whom much is given, much is required. And so if you're on TV, if you're a sports person, a sports analyst, anything, a lot's been given to you. Therefore, you are required and have a responsibility to, as best you can, be accurate with the information you're given.

ANDY SERWER: And you feel comfortable at Fox? I mean, a lot of people would say, wow, you're-- you have these opinions. And let's be honest here-- because that's what you talked about in your book, ask the tough questions. Fox, not necessarily known for the most progressive company in the world. And you feel like you're able to do your job there?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, my job is to positively contribute to society. My job beyond being a sports analyst, beyond being a Black man is being a human being, and my job is to leave this world better than I found it. I try not to put myself in compromising positions. And as you'll notice in the book, ""Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man,"" I'm not divisive. Your experience is your expertise. I'm speaking from my experience because that is my expertise.

ANDY SERWER: Is there any way you could take this show on the road? I mean, you've got YouTube. You're on Fox right now. But, like, how else have you thought about, you know, bringing your message across? Can you do, like-- well, we can't do in-person things anymore, so we can forget that idea. But just in terms of consulting with CEOs or going to Washington, testifying before Congress, have you had any opportunities to do that?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, I speak-- I've spoken to probably 80 or so companies already via Zooms, diversity and inclusion speaking. You know, I got called by a four-star general to come speak to a branch of our military. And so I've definitely been reached out to by so many companies, and I encourage them to reach out. Like, don't let the blind lead the blind. Figure out the direction you want to go, and couple that with your good intent.

ANDY SERWER: And what kind of aspirations do you have right now for yourself professionally, Emmanuel, in terms of broadcasting or maybe even beyond or doing things in addition to that?

EMMANUEL ACHO: You know, Andy, I don't believe in setting goals. I believe in having an objective with no limitations. I got my masters in sports psychology, and my final paper was on having an objective with no limitations instead of setting goals. So my objective is just to continue changing the world, continue trying to be a bridge for racial reconciliation, continue to try to lead to healing and understanding between my white brothers and sisters and my Black brothers and sisters.

ANDY SERWER: You want to know something really weird, Emmanuel? We see it right over that shoulder there. You see that animal?

EMMANUEL ACHO: So-- it looks like a longhorn.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, well-- yes. So here's the thing. It's a bull because, you know, Wall Street and all that, right? That's me. But it is actually a longhorn, and you're a Longhorn, right?

EMMANUEL ACHO: Absolutely.

ANDY SERWER: And the last person I talked to, the last interview I did just two days ago was another Longhorn, Matthew McConaughey.

EMMANUEL ACHO: All right, all right, all right.

ANDY SERWER: Exactly. It's like a whole Longhorn festival going on here with-- the last couple days. So just to wrap things up here, I'm curious about what you think, in your heart of hearts-- what you hope America can look like, say, a few years from now when maybe we're a little bit more together again.

EMMANUEL ACHO: Andy, I'll tell you how I end my book. I say that racism is not a-- racial equality is not a finish line that we'll cross. It's a road that we will travel. Unlike in a football game-- the objective is to cross the goal line and get a touchdown and put six points on the board. Racial equality isn't like that. We have to choose to travel the road together.

So what does a world with equality look like? It looks like Black people, white people, different cultures, brown people, light people celebrating our accomplishments together, mourning with one another, rejoicing with one another, but doing it in peace and unity and in love.

ANDY SERWER: Now, that is a vision I can buy into. Emmanuel Acho, author of the new book, ""Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man,"" thank you so much for your time.

EMMANUEL ACHO: Thank you, my man.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: A life in the public eye. We've watched as Hollywood icon Matthew McConaughey performed his great transformation, beating the typecast rom-comer to become an Academy Award winning actor and, now, a best-selling author. But if you ask him, McConaughey prefers to call himself a storyteller, proving it with his new memoir, ""Greenlights,"" in which he lays bare the stories and life lessons that have made him the success he is today. McConaughey's reach goes beyond the silver screen. He's invested in startups and soccer, partnered with Wild Turkey and Ford, and he's even taken on a new role as Minister of Culture for Austin, Texas. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I'm joined by Matthew McConaughey, as he shares his thoughts on life, money, and how he paved the way for ""Greenlights"" over the course of his career.

Hello, everyone. Welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest, Matthew McConaughey, Oscar award-winning actor and best-selling author of ""Greenlights,"" a really cool new book. Matthew, great to see you.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Good to see you, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So I read the book and loved it. It's just very different, you know? I mean there's a lot of actors who write memoirs and books about themselves. But this was sort of a different way of exploring your own self as a character. And so I'm wondering, you had Matthew McConaughey, iconoclastic character over here, and the traditional book industry over here. Right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm. Yes.

ANDY SERWER: And then the two of them have to come together.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yes.

ANDY SERWER: And I wonder what that was like. How much did the book industry change your thinking about how you were going to do the book, and how much did you say, no, I want to do it this way?

Story continues

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: 100% the second half. I mean, I went in and was very clear with my publishers and editors that, look, this is what I think the book will be. It's not a Hollywood tell-all. I remember I wrote this down on day two when I went away to write. I said, look, I understand that me, as Matthew McConaughey, have some equity with, I write a book, some people are going to go buy it even if what's on the page isn't worth a damn. Some people are not going to buy it, even if the words on the page are great, because it's Matthew McConaughey. I understand the equity that my name brings into it, and the platform that that inherently brings. But I remember writing, the second day, I was like, look, the words on this page need to be worthy to be in a book and be shared if they are signed by anonymous. And, at the same time, be words that only I could've written. So that was the place where I was going, this is not me going and writing a book of me as a celebrity. This is me writing my book-- And there's some celebrity in it, because I am a celebrity. So, I was saying, it was very clear with them that that's what I was out to write, and I was very clear with them what the book was not going to be. Like, this is not a tell-all book.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: This is not a book of me telling stories out of school that are not my stories to tell. And I'm not going to add anything in there unless I think they can be constructive, for me and, hopefully, others.

ANDY SERWER: So I saw it right here. And I said, well, that's you, right there. And I said, you know, I'm going to pick this thing up and read it. And then I had no idea, ""New York Times"" best seller. Why do you think this book is resonating with so many people, and why is it so popular?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: You know, I learned something in the writing of this, and it had to do with the challenge that I was finding of when do I use the first-person I in the storytelling, the second-person you, and the third-person royal we. Well, you've got to watch it with the we's, because you can come across as arrogant, and platitudinal, and, like, who the hell is he, speaking for all of humanity? You've got to watch it with the you's, because then it sounds like the writer's talking at you, or telling you what to do. And it gives a dislocation between me, the writer, and you, the reader. And what I found is that, if I stuck to the I, just go personal, Matthew. Tell the subjective, how you saw it, how you-- It actually became more relatable to the royal we. So the more personal I got, the more relatable to more people it became. And I noticed that in the writing. I was like, oh, if you just stick with the I, and how it feels to you, then it's going to relate to more people. So I think that's what's happening. I think people are reading it. They're somehow seeing themselves, or circumstances in their lives, that are similar to mine. Seeing where, maybe, they reacted and had a perspective that was similar or different. Seeing me word different tools for with which to approach certain situations that I found gave some satisfaction, that maybe they could use in their life. And I think people are finding it just plain, damn funny.

ANDY SERWER: It is. I was telling people, it's kind of like a ""True Detective,"" you know, like that TV show that you were in. A wild ride. Very much so. Hey, so, in the book, Matthew, at one point, when you were taking a break from rom-coms, and you're just saying, I'm going to sacrifice the here and now for a better later, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yep.

ANDY SERWER: And you said, as Warren Buffett said, and my eyes are like this, because, you know, I'm a business guy. You said, as Warren Buffett says, buying straw hats in the winter. So my question is, how much do you follow Warren Buffett, or know about him? Or do you own Berkshire Hathaway stock?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I don't follow it much. I have a money man landlord who follows it. And I think I had read that quote years ago. But I don't follow it. I don't follow it daily. I do follow, sort of, cultural trends, and try to disseminate how much am I, from the subjective POV of what happens as an entertainer, in the culture of entertainment? And, you know, how much does the entertainment and pop culture lead trends? And how much does it just react to trends? And things like that. And I've always been someone who has kept sort of a docket of my own consumer reports about products. And how much do you want a product? How much do you need a product? How much does a product that any of us put out, whether it's ourselves or one we create, invent, or discover, how much are they in demand? And there has to be a certain amount of demand. And what would be in demand in a time like COVID comes along? What's in demand in a time of a drought? What's in demand in a time of great affluence? So those are the trends that I keep my eye on.

ANDY SERWER: Anything catching your eye right now?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, what we're doing right now is going to remain, to some extent, the new normal. Even if the vaccine, which is coming out soon, so they say, and if that becomes successful and more people get vaccinated, there are millions of people who are going to say, no, thank you. I practiced remotely doing business and having interactions this way. I prefer it. So how does this experience become more exclusive? More intimate? More customized? Because, in many ways, I myself prefer this. Not with everybody. But, in many ways, I have. And then I have to look at my productivity, which I know many companies have looked at their productivity. And, in some of the companies, the productivity has gone up, to see how adaptable their employees can be. So, you know, but then I have to look across even my industry of acting. What's the future of theaters? What's the future of all of these communal events? What's the future of my home city of Austin, which is a big hospitality town? Which means you've got to do it hand to hand. And then, you know, there's a version that I see of the world turning into of go live wherever you want on the planet. As long as you've got 5G, you can be anywhere. We'll see how much that's the new normal. How much now is the future.

ANDY SERWER: Have you talked to people in Hollywood much about how things are going to go from here? Maybe starting up production, or anything like that?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I haven't really. Most my friends are still working, and they're telling me that it's going safely, and then there's all the rules and regulations of how they do it. I've been more conservative with our quarantine. I've got my 88-year-old mother with us. I've got my family, three children and my wife. And I'm also in a privileged position, to where I've saved my money where I don't have to work today to pay my rent tomorrow. So I'm in a privileged position to say I'm going to be more conservative with my quarantine. But I've also noticed that I've been quite productive through this. I've employed my children now to be part of my production team when we're shooting photo shoots and shooting ads. And they're starting to get adept with cameras, and editing, et cetera. So who knows? I may come out of this in a couple of years and go, I'm a one-stop shop. I've got McConaughey kids, my production team. What do you want done? We'll shoot it. We'll make it.

ANDY SERWER: McConaughey family productions.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: That'd be fun.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. Yeah. Hey, so getting back to the book, there was a moment in there where you talked about one of your films that has a strong business slant. And you had a part in that which really resonated with people as well, which is ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm.

ANDY SERWER: And I'm wondering, you know, did that change your thinking about Wall Street? Or did you research the financial services business when you were doing that part? I mean, that was pretty epic, when you just came in and did that soliloquy, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, that character's soliloquy was awesome. I mean, you know, I try to find what's called a launchpad line with every character. Meaning it's a line that you read and you go, oh. If that character means this, then there's an encyclopedia I could write, and I'll make a whole rap on that character. Meaning, like, in ""Dazed and Confused,"" there was a character, Wooderson, I played, where he's hanging out in the pool yard and checking out that high school girls going by. And his buddy says, you've got to cut that out, Wooderson, you're going to end up in jail. And Wooderson goes, no, man, that's what I love about those high school girls, man. I get older and they stay the same age. Well, I remember reading that line and going, well, who the heck is that? There's a book on that guy. If that guy believes that, if he's not saying that as an attitude, or to be cool or anything, if he believes that, there's a book on a person who goes through life believing that. Well, with ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" I remember reading this line where he's telling the Belfort character, that Leonardo played, the secret to this business is cocaine and hookers. And I went--

[LAUGHTER]

I went, who is that? I go, well, if this person really believes that, well, there was a rap. So I just started writing and interviewing different brokers about how it was then. And how, you know, you sort of create a mirage and you just kind of keep it going. And I wrote a lot of that rap. And, luckily, you know I pitched it Scorsese. He was all for it. And went and just laid it down in that scene. It was a wonderful, classic scene, and so much fun to do.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. It was an awesome part of an awesome movie, too.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: Let's switch gears a little bit, Matthew, and I want to talk to you about some brand stuff. Because that's interesting, and it seems to sort of fit with the road that you take, which is sticking to who you are. And, you know, the Lincoln commercials, and your brand ambassadorship with Lincoln, part of Ford, of course, has been very high profile. It's been, you know, Ellen's done it. Jim Carrey. ""South Park."" I mean, it's been all over the place. But it seems to have really worked. And you seem really comfortable in those commercials. And I think Lincoln's comfortable with you. Is that the case?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: We're selling cars. We're selling automobiles. We're selling SUVs. Indeed. I mean, look, Lincoln and I, and the Ford company, have had a great relationship since the beginning. Hudson Rouge, the ad agency, we're still working with the same people there, John Pearce over there. So, myself, Lincoln, Ford, and the ad company, were all very aligned in what we wanted to do. And so we came out with the first ads, and I was coming off of ""True Detective."" And so I riffed on a bunch of those things that I say in the car. And those got parodied, ""Saturday Night Live"" and Ellen. And that's like, OK, great. And some of the parodies were actually very good. Some were better than others. But I don't mind an impersonation of me. Just be really good at it. And some of them did some damn good work. Well, that sort of got attention and eyeballs on it. And we said early on, look, there's so many loud commercials out there. All the ads are, like, who can turn up the volume the most? Well, what if we make such an intentional and deliberate commercial, that's so quiet that it actually cuts through the noise? And I saw it happen. I was in sports bars on Sunday afternoons, with loud males and females screaming over the game. And then the ad would come on, and they'd go-- And their head would turn to the TV to see the ad. So it worked. And we've maintained a very consistent tone. What we've gotten to is where you want to get to, I believe, is where I've become synonymous with Lincoln and Lincoln has become synonymous with me. So we're feeding each other. And we continue. We just made some ads here recently that we're putting out. And the SUVs that are coming out of there are doing well. And it's helped some sales. And they've got a really good product. I'm especially, particularly, fond of that Navigator that I've had, which is a really, really, really good product.

ANDY SERWER: Was there any connection to ""Lincoln Lawyer?"" Or just a coincidence?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Not really. Just, really, a coincidence. I mean, there was a connection. I had driven a Lincoln before, and had one, and owned one, and drove one in my own life. But that was really just a coincidental callback, that I had done ""Lincoln Lawyer"" as well.

ANDY SERWER: Another brand you work with, which has a long, cool commercial. I mean, it's more than a commercial. It's one of these films, mini-films, is Wild Turkey. Which I happen to be a huge fan of. I drive Fords, too, by the way. But I really like Wild Turkey. I have for a very long time. So I watch that with particular interest.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm.

ANDY SERWER: But it was very candid, also. You say, hey, they wanted me to come down and do this. I wanted to do more than just go, hey, buy Wild Turkey, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, once again, I mean, look. For me, it was cool that these were two American companies. You know, Ford Lincoln, American company. Bourbon, in general, is actually an American invention. Then I go to meet the Russell family. You know, I'm at a time in my life where I want to be in business with people that I believe in what they do. Not that they're perfect. But I believe in what they do, that we're both authentic in what we do and why we do it. The Wild Turkey came along after I got to know the Russell family. And they're three generations, and how they haven't changed, when they could have changed to maybe be more popular. But they were set in their ways, and they knew they had a damn good, solid bourbon in 101. And that that, though it may have its fads and be more popular at other times than not, that they were going to stick to it, because that was a quintessential, great bourbon. And after the world and America went through the white spirits time, and wanted to go through bourbon lights, and then came out going, I really want a great, solid bourbon. The Russell family and Campari had plenty of 101 bottles to go, well, here you go. This is exactly what you're looking for. And consumers went, yes, that is what we're looking for. At the same time, I didn't want to be just a face. I talked with them and shared stories. So I became the creative director with them, helping with the ad campaign. Who's our audience we have that we want to keep? Who's the new generation that we have to introduce Wild Turkey to? And then I also co-created my own bourbon, Longbranch, with Eddie Russell. Which was always a dream of mine, to have my own favorite bourbon on the planet, which is what we have in that bottle.

ANDY SERWER: That's a good thing. Hey, let me ask you about some of your investments. And I want to start off with Austin FC, your soccer team. How's that going? And are you guys on track to actually play next year?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: We are on track, and it's going really well. You know, soccer, the game of soccer, the international sport of soccer, I'm betting on that, too. I really think that's a real riser as a game in our future. We have the World Cup coming in a few years. So we're going to be the front porch for the international game of football, right here in North America. Austin, a perfect city for the international game of soccer. A town that's never had a pro team. A town that's only team in town is the University of Texas Longhorns. And now, where Austin used to be a college town, a government town, and a music town, well, it's now a banker town, a dot-com town, lawyer town, and an international destination. There are millions of people in Austin that didn't go to UT. It's a very diverse community, for the most diverse game in the world, soccer. The greatest invitation in the world, as I call it, the soccer ball. We now have soccer coming to Austin. Now what we're looking forward to do is how are we going to bring Austin to soccer?

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. That's going to be fun to watch.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: And shaping the experience in our backyard, at our stadium. Which, you know, the grass got put in last week on the pitch. And something about just seeing real grass being put in that stadium made it all feel a whole lot more real. And, yes, as of right now, we are still on track to kick off next season.

ANDY SERWER: You've seen that show ""Ted Lasso?"" You could get him to be your coach.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I've seen the ads. I haven't the show.

ANDY SERWER: Check it out. It's funny. Speaking of sports, Matthew, you also have a stake in ""The Athletic,"" I believe, which is a digital sports media business. Media business can be kind of tough. How's that going? Did you invest in that with Peter Thiel? Did you get a chance to meet with him? How's that going?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yes. It's going well. And I did invest in it. And, look, I like sports enough to really appreciate an A-plus perspective on sports. I don't mind the B-minus, sort of the everyman, the sort of half-sports fan knowledge. But I like A-plus sports knowledge. But I don't really like it all in straight metrics. I like a good story told. And they have really great writers over there. And I'm a storyteller. They tell a good story. They're not out to get the athlete. They're in to talk about the story, and the athletics, and all the different mechanisms that go into sports, from the business side, to the personal side, to the players' rights side, to the love of the game. They cover all of those. And so, once again, this was another product that I go, I partake of this product. I drive a Lincoln. I drink Wild Turkey. I like soccer. I like great sportswriting. Oh, I'd love to-- It's more authentic if I can get into something that, on my proverbial Monday morning desk, when I have work to do or to go over something, I look forward to that work. So all of these entities you're talking about and my investments are things that I look forward to dealing with on my proverbial Monday morning at my office desk.

ANDY SERWER: Did you get a chance to meet with Peter Thiel and talk to him about it? I mentioned him.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yes. And when did we talk? We hadn't talked in person. Because this all happened, I believe, since COVID.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. That's what I read, right? So you guys chatted about it a little bit?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah. About the things I just told you.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: The last investment I want to ask you about, that I know about, is something that really interested me, this Forward company, which is a high-tech, membership-only health facility. And, of course, everyone says, wow, it's just like ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" because it's a monthly membership. But it is a monthly membership. And, again, I guess that's just a coincidence too. I mean, is there any connection between that?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: No, there's no real connection between that. That was brought to me as an opportunity from a friend of mine who's an investment, Guy Oseary. And the concept of-- And this was years ago, I invested in this. That people would be able to, sort of, self-maintain their health and communicate with their doctor remotely. It was something where I was like, that sounds evolutionary. That sounds like that could be more than a convenience. That could be a need. That could be more than just a luxury. That could be something that could be good for a lot of people who are not as privileged as others, to have that capacity, an immediate response with their doctor through a remote device. So that just sounded to me as a really good idea for the future.

ANDY SERWER: And my understanding is you've got other investors, like Ashton Kutcher, Bono, and The Edge. Have you met with them and talked to them about it at all?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: No. No. I haven't talked to them really about it. Just mainly Guy and Ashton.

ANDY SERWER: OK. Yeah, I think the CEO and founder was a guy who was running artificial intelligence at Google. Sounds like kind of a brainiac.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Adrian. Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, right?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: Impressive sounding guy. Any other investments that I'm missing here that you want to share with us?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: The only other investment is a category that I'm creating now, which is Minister of Culture role.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Talk about that.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I'm working with the University of Texas at Austin and in the city of Austin. I'm working on a shared and competent values campaign that will sell a city to itself. The best assets of the city. In my particular case, the Petri dish will be Austin. Sell Austin to Austinites. Let newcomers know. You know, educate them and initiate them to who we are and who we're not. I think values are what need to be shared right now, not only across cities and universities, but also across businesses. We're, you know, taking the B Corp model of purpose, and people, and profit. That there's a tithe to pay for a great city that we live in like Austin. And we need to be giving back to it, because we want to preserve what we love about it so much. And I also believe values are what's going to bind the social contracts between people again. Especially now, at a time of such great distrust that we have in each other. Where we don't know what our leaders are about. We don't know who to believe in. We've got to bind the social contracts with each other again. And we can do that, personally, across cities, across institutions, and across businesses.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. Amen to that. I mean, I was going to ask, and I'll follow up a little bit. I mean, if you think about Austin, and, say, Armadillo World Headquarters, right? And going back to those days, where, famously, you know, the hippies would sit with the cowboys. That was sort of the whole part of that cultural thing going on there. And we really lost that in this country. And, you know, you're someone who I see can really bridge that divide. But I want to ask you, you know, a lot of people point fingers at income and wealth inequality, number one. And then, number two, social media.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Mm-hmm.

ANDY SERWER: And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on both of those, Matthew.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, so the first one, your question is my thoughts on income and--

ANDY SERWER: Wealth inequality. The wealth gaps in this country.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Yeah. Well, you know, it sure seems like, a lot of times, when we break down the differences between us, by our sex, or color of skin, or what have you, boy, the real place that everything sort of finds its waterline is in our socioeconomic level. You know, especially in America, the capitalist society. Money's still king, you know? You need it to get what you want. It's what America tells our children and ourselves what to be successful is. Money and fame. I think, you know, we need to not necessarily have those always at the top. And, also, I think, what I mean by that is I'm all for making money. I have good money. I'm all for fame. I'm happy to be famous. But I'm inspired by looking at people like a John Mackey with Wholes Foods, or a Marc Benioff with Salesforce, that go, hey, I have an idea that's really good to do even if it was for nonprofit. But let's make profit off of it. So what are those things that we can ask ourselves, hey, no, I want to sell this? I want to make this. I want to make money off this. I want to get rich off this. And how can it also be, can we parlay that to be in something like, oh, and it's good for the most amount of people? Those two are interchangeable. And they don't have to be a contradiction. And I hope that more of us invest in those kind of things. Because you can make a really good living, a for profit living, with a nonprofit idea. And your second question was social media?

ANDY SERWER: Social media. Yeah. What's your take on that these days?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I think it's a great tool. And, look, I just got on Instagram, I think, a year ago. My communication, and that platform for me to share parts of myself out with, have already been good for me, valuably, because I have a direct line of communication. And it's not through someone else's filter. It's a direct line. At the same time, it's been good for my business, you know? People check now. I didn't know this until I got on IG. Before you do certain jobs, they go, let me check how many followers you have. Those followers matter, even for business. For advertisers and things like that. What the scary part is, that we have to really watch, is, for the first time in our lives, we, especially children and millennials, are getting their entire sense of self based on something they put. A picture, a phrase, something that they, poof, send out to the world. And they anxiously wait to see what all these strangers are going to say about it. And if the thumbs come back up, I'm going to have a great day. Look at me. I'm popular. If the thumbs come back down, I drop into a depression. Well, that's not healthy. And where does the responsibility lie? I mean, one, it lies with us parents of our children. Say, hey, make sure you're not getting your sense of wealth, and identity, and significance based on just approval or disapproval of the rest of the world. Because understand that there's a lot of folks out there, that are putting the thumb down or writing something negative, and they didn't even read or look at what you wrote. All right? So, again, where are we allotting value, and where are we allotting what our kids? I always say this. Kiddos, millennials, all of us, that thing you type in there, that comment, what you say, it's going to outlive you. It's going to outlive all of us. So think about it before you press send, and before you write it. And, also, this. It's short money, short money, to think that to put you down raises me up. It doesn't.

ANDY SERWER: So do you think we can come together as a country again, Matthew?

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I know we can. But here's what I think we have to also watch. We're not going to become a kumbaya. There's not going to be perfect justice across society. We're not going to have a utopia. And I think that it's irrational to think that we are. I think it's actually arrogant, sometimes, to think that this species-- And we could go into the denominations, who voted what and where. We are evolving. But we're never going to be our best. We're not going to get there. And I think that's the point. If we could just do a little bit better, have a small ascension to the quality of our lives, and who we are, and how we treat ourselves and others in it, then there's a small ascension in our life, and in society, and in America. America is an aspiration. Constantly chasing, yet. But we've got to realize, we ain't ever going to get to yet. But that's the point. Trying to get a little bit better is as good as it gets. So join the party in trying to be a little bit better and chasing yet.

ANDY SERWER: The last question, and the only place to go from there, has got to be UT football. And I'm just wondering, you know, is that back? Are you on board? How's the team looking? The schedule. All that.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: Well, I'm on board. I'm always on board. No matter what state we're in, or what our record is, I'm on board. You know? I'm not a coattail chaser, by any means. I'm a Longhorn fan. No matter if we just got beat 46 to 3, there we go, by UCLA 10 years ago, or whether we just won the Big 12 or the National Championship. So I'm on board. Are where we want to be? Not yet. But we're on our way. You come to UT, you are expected to compete for national championships in that sport, especially football, which is our front porch. We're not doing that right now. I do believe we're on our way, yes. We have some great athletes. You know, you've got this, you know, new challenge today with one of the things we were just talking about, social media. And the 18 to 22-year-old student playing in the proverbial third person, you know, running down the sideline, looking at the jumbotron, how do I look? Well, we do that. You know, taking the selfie while you're still on the 50, running for the touchdown. Because, immediately, you're getting a response on your game and you're finding out how people feel about it. And you're getting objective of your situation. Hopping out of yourself, looked at yourself. Texas football is really going to help us get to the heights we need to, in this time, to forget about that. We have that spotlight on us. We'll find that out. Again, I said this the other day in an interview, play every single play, every single quarter, every half, every game. And, when the fourth quarter is over, be running down to the other end, ready for the fifth quarter because you think it's the fourth, and have the coaches tell you, no, no, no. Game's over. We won. And if you do that, if you're almost that unconscious that the game's even over, if you have your proverbial goal line so far ahead of you, your finish line, you're usually going to look up on the scoreboard and see you win. So it's play more in the first person, be more present, understand that there's no auditions when you come to University of Texas. It's on. It's live. Step up. Let's roll.

ANDY SERWER: All right. We're going to leave it there. Matthew McConaughey, actor and author of ""Greenlights."" Thank you so much for joining us.

Earlier this week, Pfizer’s positive vaccine news sent entertainment stocks surging as the sector embraced the possibility of a return to a pre-pandemic existence.

But life might not ever return to ‘normal’ for in-person entertainment, and the beaten down industry seems to be running out of time.

AMC (AMC) reported a nearly $1 billion loss in the third quarter, and on Tuesday filed to offer another 20 million shares. The obvious objective is to keep the company afloat, as the threat of bankruptcy looms with COVID-19 cases continuing to surge across the country.

“I think it’s going to be near impossible for [AMC] to last without doing something else,” Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon told Yahoo Finance. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - AUGUST 20: Joey Walsh sanitizes the concession stand at AMC Town Square 18 on August 20, 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

“To get through this, [AMC will] have to do something from a portfolio trimming and asset monetization standpoint,” he explained, referring to a strategy that may involve selling off properties, or at least finding ways to make them generate cash.

“They have roughly $400 million in cash right now but [they’re] burning $100 million a month,” Beynon added.

“That gets them into this February, March time period — which is pretty close to when most people think consumers will get out, so really the only way [to minimize that bankruptcy risk] is to do something with their portfolio,” he continued.

‘Praying there won’t be more delays’ Movie delays due to COVID-19

Since April, AMC has raised roughly a billion dollars “to essentially stay afloat,” Beynon said. Still, it’s been difficult for the theater chain to attract consumers amid increased film delays.

Highly anticipated tentpoles like Marvel’s “Black Widow,” MGM’s “No Time To Die,” and WB’s “Dune” have all delayed their release dates to 2021.

So far, the only big blockbuster left in 2020 is “Wonder Woman: 1984,” which is still on track for a December 25, 2020 debut although it seems unlikely that that date will stick.

On Friday, reports emerged that Warner Bros. executives are debating the film’s release strategy — mulling either a January HBO Max (T) release, or a possible delay to summer 2021.

“Those blockbuster movies that generate about $100 million domestically, they account for about 60% of the box office in the U.S., so they're critical to keeping these businesses afloat,” Beynon told Yahoo Finance.

“The problem with this is the theaters are open. They're waiting for the content, and they're just sitting and praying that there won't be more delays,” he added.

In the interim, theaters are rolling out on innovative alternates to help offset costs. On Tuesday, AMC announced it will launch a program where anyone can privately rent out a movie theater. That followed a four-week trial where the theater chain said it received over 110,000 requests across the country.

Prices begin at $99 and include tickets for up to 20 people. Meanwhile, newly-released film like Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” are a bit pricier — with costs ranging from $149 and $349.

“Certainly desperate times call for desperate measures. AMC has done their part in terms of sanitizing the theaters and doing everything they can do for the consumers to come in and they just have not come,” Beynon said.

“I don’t think it’s going to do much from a cash flow perspective, but it can certainly get people back to theaters, which is what they need,” he continued.

88,2020-11-13T14:37:50+00:00,"Disney reports Q4 earnings, sees strength in Disney+ paid subscribers","CFRA’s Tuna Amobi joined Yahoo Finance Live to break down Disney’s fourth-quarter earnings report and the lastest subscriber numbers for Disney+.

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: All right. Let's move on to Disney, a very big company that already is public, of course. And that company came out with its earnings after the close yesterday. And as we talked about, subscriber growth for Disney+ better than estimated, 73.7 million even as the rest of the business is not doing so hot.

Tuna Amobi is joining us now. He's an analyst at CFRA who covers Disney. So, Tuna, as you look at these numbers, yes, Disney+ is doing great, but not much else is, right? So how long can Disney sustain that kind of disconnect?

TUNA AMOBI: Julie, I think, you know, it's no surprise that the streaming offerings, Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu have become, you know, the brightest spot in the Disney empire. So we know that, you know, COVID-19 has taken a very significant toll on the theme parks as well as the media networks and the film divisions. So what's happening right now with Disney is kind of a recalibration of the model to a direct-to-consumer.

And as you alluded to, 120 million global subscribers for the three offerings. And particularly, [? company ?] first-hand investor of Disney+ now closing in, you know, at $74, $75 million, I think. That's a huge outperformance by any stretch.

When you put all that together, with the tailwinds that we're seeing in COVID-19, I think Disney, really, right now is breathing down the neck of Netflix in terms of potentially catching them, you know, sooner than later. And that's why you're seeing the stock trade at such a huge premium. That being said, I think the near-term visibility continues to be limited by the COVID-19 surge. As we just heard Anjalee's report, that is something that continues to be an overhang for the theme parks and the film.

But if you can look beyond that, our thesis is that Disney has come off [INAUDIBLE] earnings in the last fiscal year. For this year, they still got a few speed bumps to navigate in [? this ?] [? coming ?] [? quarter-- ?] December quarter with the, essentially, some of the parks still closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity. The theaters still, you know, having some stutter steps in terms of reopening. But I think as we kind of look towards the back half of this fiscal year, and if we improve prospects of vaccine development, Julie, we continue to believe that Disney's one of the prime beneficiaries of a potential re-opening of the economy with the vaccine prospects.

Story continues

BRIAN SOZZI: Tuna, one number I'm hearing talked about this morning on the street is 250 million. Disney exited the quarter with over 120 million streaming subscribers. When do you think they can more than double that number? And where would that growth come from?

TUNA AMOBI: That's a great question, you know, Brian. I think as we kind of think about the next three to five years, the catalyst that we see for the continued growth of the streaming would be the international rollout of Disney+, now in 20 countries and set to ramp up significantly from here on out. They're gonna be launching in Latin America and a few other markets in the next few days.

And then added to that is this star-branded entertainment offering, which they've announced is gonna be their general entertainment offering, which is also on track with the launch. And then you add to that the significant momentum that we're seeing in domestic market, not just for Disney+-- remember, ESPN+ and Hulu are all accelerating as well. So all things kind of tied together with the tailwinds from COVID-19, you know, our thesis is that COVID-19 has actually expanded the addressable market of these streaming offerings.

So to your question more precisely, Brian, we think that it's quite realistic to expect that in the next, you know, three to five years, potentially much earlier, it could double that number. If you remember when they laid out the case for the streaming and investors, they-- investors last year, they kind of laid the case for 60 to 90 million subscribers globally in the first five years. In hindsight, that kind of looks like, you know, it was really a ridiculous number because they blew past that. And now it's close on the one year anniversary of Disney+.

The challenge is going to be to keep those subscribers, those free trials that they had when they launched Disney+ with the Verizon partnership. But they've added a ton of content since that, right? They've got season 2 of ""Mandalorian,"" just launched a couple weeks ago. A ton of new content that should help to keep engagement high and churn relatively manageable.

MYLES UDLAND: You know, Tuna, you mentioned Netflix. And when you think about that company and its shareholder base, they have, obviously, completely different expectations for profitability and how that's going to work. Do you have any concerns as an analyst that the Disney investor base would lose their nerve as the business model pivots towards what the company explicitly says is an unprofitable part of the business.

And, you know, I thought Bob Chapek's comments yesterday were quite interesting when he said the sports rights, they look at it on a shareholder-friendly basis. He's certainly more cognizant of how his investors think about the company. And I think Reed Hastings, who kind of says, well, we're gonna do whatever we're gonna do. You can get on board if you want. And I think that's a big shift for this management team over the next five years.

TUNA AMOBI: Right. Now, Myles, I think you ask-- you brought up a pretty good point. And I think The Street is actually in for some surprise in terms of the potential inflection to profitability for these streaming offerings. ESPN and Hulu, more specifically, have actually been doing some of the heavy lifting on the profit side with advertising and substitution growth while Disney+ remains in a very heavy investment mode.

So while the company has telegraphed-- and we think it'll still be a few years before we see a profitability for the international-- for the streaming offerings as a whole-- we think the timeline for that could actually be pulled forward just based on the better-than-expected performance that we're seeing from ESPN+ and Hulu. So that being said, I think, you know, everyone expects Disney+ to invest heavily. They're still in startup mode launching across international markets.

So, you know, I think if you look at this quarter-- they just reported on the other last quarter-- the expectations in terms of the aggregate losses from the international-- from the streaming and direct-to-consumer segment actually came in better than expectations. So I think that the trajectory that we expect is gonna be volatile. But over time, I think you're gonna see a smoothing out effect where, you know, the profitability for that, I think, will be sooner than The Street is currently expecting.

JULIE HYMAN: All right. So, Tuna, we'll have patience. We'll see about the rest of The Street. Tuna Amobi, CFRA analyst, thank you so much. Appreciate it, Tuna.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/disney-reports-q4-earnings-sees-143750765.html?.tsrc=rss,"['DIS.US', 'NFLX.US', 'XLK.US', 'XLP.US', 'XLY.US']",['DISNEY'],"{'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.102}"
89,2020-11-12T14:00:00+00:00,Influencers with Andy Serwer: Reid Hoffman,"In this episode of Influencers, Andy speaks with LinkedIn Co-Founder and Greylock Partner, Reid Hoffman, about the incoming Biden administration, big tech regulation, fighting misinformation on social media, and what's in store for U.S./China relations.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Who better to weigh in on the challenges of a life at home than billionaire venture capitalist Reid Hoffman? An original member of the tech industry's PayPal Mafia, Hoffman was an early believer in social media, creating one of the internet's first social networks before launching the business-focused site LinkedIn.

Over the years, he's made big bets on companies like Facebook and Airbnb, and now sits on the board of some of the fastest growing startups in Silicon Valley. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I'm joined by Reid Hoffman as we discuss the future of the tech sector, the outcome of the 2020 election, and where he's putting his money to work as we look toward the near year.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest Reid Hoffman, entrepreneur, investor, venture capitalist, partner at VC firm Greylock, and Co-founder of LinkedIn. Reid, great to see you.

REID HOFFMAN: Great to see you as well, even in these modern pandemic times as we do this over Skype.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, exactly. And so much to talk about, Pandemic and the election. Let's start with the election, Reid. And you have supported the Democrats and Joe Biden, invested resources into ousting President Trump. What's the most important reason why Joe Biden won?

REID HOFFMAN: I think the most important reason is actually, in fact, a need to return to stability, to unity rather than division, right? And then to apply expertise to questions like the pandemic. Because even though there might be some politicization about how bad is the pandemic and how much a shutdown is necessary, we should apply public health knowledge. We should apply scientific knowledge. We should apply economic knowledge in order to actually do good governance on it.

Story continues

And I think it's very much a referendum on, no, no, it's not a reality television show. Good governance matters. And I think that's one of the things where Biden, who's a lifelong centrist, who's part of the reason why his inaugural message was, I am here to govern for the entire country for everyone's well-being, not just the people who voted for me, in stark contrast, obviously, to President Trump.

ANDY SERWER: Reid, it's refreshing to hear you speaking out, whether or not I even happen to agree with you politically, because there are a lot of people who won't, business people who won't speak out. And again, either side of the aisle. How hard is it for you to do that? Because obviously, you're alienating some people.

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I definitely get grief. I get grief whether it's in a LinkedIn context or generally. And that's frustrating because most of the places where I try to speak out on this, I'm speaking out on a basis of rule of law, anti-corruption.

It's one of the reasons why I actually posted on LinkedIn recently, kind of like what is the-- and on Greylock, why CEOs should speak up in politics in some times. Because it isn't that speaking up on politics is necessarily being partisan.

If you're kind of like, look, what we want is we want stability, we want actionability to kind of work together, those kinds of things, that claim, if it is partisan, that it's partisan only on the side of goodness. Now, there are other times where I will also make some claims because there's a particular value that I like and many of those values are on the Democratic side.

But obviously, I'm very pro-business. And very pro-entrepreneurship. I'm very pro-technology. So there's a stack of things where I will articulate those. But as business people, if we want a centrist country, we want to not be run by the extremes of either the left or the right, you do need to speak up with the things that are the baseline centrism. Rule of law, count every vote, peaceful transition of power. These things matter for the health of our country and for the health of business.

ANDY SERWER: Well, let's talk about that a little bit more, then. I mean, President Trump has said, I didn't lose the election and is challenging and contesting the results in specific states that he's lost by even an excess of 100,000 votes. He's lost the popular vote by close to 5 million. How do you think this is going to play out?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think ultimately, we will see a transition of power. I think we will see sabotage from Trump and his administration on that transition. I think that sabotage is essentially anti-American. It's anti not just rule of law and process, but in good governance, for all of us as American citizens who live here.

And that's, I think, because President Trump has fundamentally more approached governance as a reality television show, including the COVID stuff. Like, I have a good feeling that it's going to go away. Hey, maybe you can inject bleach, right? Because, of course, you're not talking to actually medical experts and doctors on this.

And I think that's going to be a real problem and I think it's going to have a lasting impact on the divisions in the country. Because actually, in fact, we should be saying, hey, we should be coming together. We should be building our way out of the pandemic.

That should be-- you could just imagine the superstars on the Republican side, George W. Bush and other folks kind of going, OK, this is actually, in fact, we should be coming together as a country. This is essentially what we should be doing.

And I think this refusal to admit it, to treating it like it's a reality television star, of like, you know Donald Trump is on ""The Apprentice"" and refuses to be fired, is simply one more dismissive of the health of American society.

ANDY SERWER: Does this hurt the economy, Reid? And maybe in particular, Silicon Valley, and what's the conversation there like?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it definitely hurts the economy, because people frequently associate business only with free flowing capital, lower taxes, and lower regulation. And there's lots of things that help actually affect business.

Like, for example, a stable society that's predictable, an environment that you can invest in, and successful use of talent, a healthy and thriving middle class that can buy goods and services. And so actually, in fact, there's a lot of different approaches that are being pro-business, and this kind of chaos is anti-business, because it--

Now, relative to Silicon Valley, which, obviously, we're fortunate that technology is what's driving a lot of the changes in industry and in the future. So a lot of Silicon Valley investors and businesses are all benefiting from this.

Even in COVID, where we see Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, said it very well. In the first two months of the pandemic, he said, in two months, we've seen two years of digital transformation where people are using the technologies and adopting them more quickly and more thoroughly because they need to in order to keep business running. So it's been good for all that. But instability is bad for all business, including technology.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned the social media platforms of which you are so familiar. How do you think they performed and what's your assessment of what happened during this election cycle?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think we're on a learning curve, and it kind of is unfortunate that we get to experience the learning curve versus get a complete plan and release it at scale. Because I think a lot of what has happened, which both Facebook and Twitter did in the last month, is stuff you wish they'd been doing for five plus years of, hey, this is actually counter to the experts, counter to facts.

This is dangerous. This is an incitement to violence. And saying, look, we're going to frame that and we're going to make sure that people are aware of that. And I think those are the beginnings of the steps in the right direction for what should actually, in fact, be persistent.

Like, for example, you've seen some of it even drop off now. Because they said, oh, the election is over. It's been called, so release that. And you're like, well, actually, in fact, people calling for election theft, which is, by the way, all the experts, including all the Republican experts, look at this and say, look, you can challenge on some narrow states and recount the ballot, but it's not going to make a difference.

Because at these numbers and at the safety of our voting systems, including the vote by mail, those have all called it. And actually, there's one particular piece I just-- I feel like I'm compelled to say, which is there was this kind of constant Republican line of, you're adding in points after the game is called.

And you're like, OK. If we want to use a metaphor, it's like you scored a leading touchdown in the third quarter, the third quarter of the game, and you want to call the game end versus waiting for the fourth quarter, right?

Like, it is, actually, in fact, every state has a law to set its vote by mail and doing vote by mail. That's not calling the game early. That's calling the game on time. And promoting that is destructive to our democracy. People should understand that, actually, every vote does count.

And it's really important that as a democracy. Like, I treasure people who I disagree with, their ability to vote. It's super important that we are in this together. And that's the legitimacy of the election results.

ANDY SERWER: We're talking mostly here about Facebook, and Twitter, and YouTube. But what about LinkedIn, Reid? Is LinkedIn immune from misinformation?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, no social media platform is completely immune because part of what you enable is you enable everyone to have a voice and to put something on. And one of the things that's a little unfortunate about them modern media ecosystem, which includes social media, is it reminds me of a Winston Churchill quote which is, a lie travels around the world three times before the truth has a chance to put its boots on.

And truth is slow in the way that it kind of works, and that's one of the things I think we need to kind of figure out as we benefit from increasing speed in communication and so forth. And so I think even LinkedIn has challenges with it.

Where it's easier for us because people tie their professional reputation, the theming is things about business. And so you don't tend to get-- like, we had a little bit of QAnon stuff because of people who put it on. You don't tend to get as much of the lackey QAnon stuff.

But we also had to kind of go, OK, this is not according to LinkedIn terms of service, so we're pulling this off. And so it has a little, but not as much as the other platforms have to contend with.

ANDY SERWER: So as we go into the Biden era, I'm curious as to what you think the direction and tenor of Washington, DC's desire to perhaps rein in or regulate the big tech platforms, what path that's going to take.

Because it's not at all clear cut. You've got Ted Cruz, David Cicilline, now Joe Biden, Senator Warner, people with very different political perspectives who seem to share distrust and anxiety about the platforms. But that's where the common ground ends, right?

REID HOFFMAN: So look, roughly speaking, I'm a-- this is not a no regulation point of view, but I am a very strong believer that we've now moved to a multipolar world. China will be building more and more of the technology platforms that matter in the coming years.

And actually, to some degree, I hope that there's other places. Like, one of the Greylock investments we have is this incubator called Entrepreneur First, which is building tech communities in Europe and in Singapore. So I hope for more of this.

But what that means is you don't disable your own player, right? You don't go, hey, let's try to do that. What you want to do is you want to shape them. You want to say, look, these outcomes, misinformation. Here is our social mandate for how we change that so we have more truth in the media ecosystem. Those kinds of things are important.

But the classic notion of an antitrust or a breakup, I think those are, generally speaking, going to be actually, in fact, a counter American health and prosperity. And by the way, I say that as my primary thing as an investor, as new startups, as competing with these large tech companies.

So it's not like an embodied interest. But actually, in fact, I think where we have maybe five tech giants today, I think five years from now, we're going to have 10 tech giants. And those competition between those tech giants is what create lots of space for startups to either get their initial base, or to grow into being the 11th, or to be bought by one of them.

And so that's part of the reason why I think actually, in fact, the antitrust isn't the right thing, but figuring out how to contribute the right way to the health of our society and global society is the right thing.

ANDY SERWER: Well, two questions here. So first of all, when you're talking about going from five to 10, are you talking about the other five being in China? And then also, what specifically, though, short of antitrust and breaking things up, would be your remedies?

REID HOFFMAN: So on the first-- actually, in fact, if you're including China, you're like five going to 25, right? So it is much larger. I was actually just talking about kind of the growth of companies like Airbnb and others as they establish on the stage.

And obviously, there's a bunch right now around Netflix, and Salesforce, and other kinds of things. So I think there's a range of these companies to become multipart technology platforms. And with China, you're going to see a ton more.

And then I think in terms of-- it's one of the things that I've actually started working on in 2019 and then I got very concerned about the 2020 election, so I'm going to get back to it soon. But it's kind of the question of, how do we build the full-- what are the tools and sets we can do to build kind of regulation of the outcomes we want, but don't try to enshrine the past? Allow adaptation in the future.

I'll give you one kind of like, microcosm example. Like, say you said, look, we don't want to have video depictions of live streams of terrorist assaults, or murderers, or anything else. So you say, what's the way you would regulate that?

Well, a simple way, like, if I was going to try to regulate, if I was in charge of regulating that today, what I would say is, OK, here's our law. It's $10,000 fine purview. And the companies have to self report, but they have to self report through their auditors. Like, the auditors have to say, this was actually, in fact, done well.

And so they self report and then we say, OK, so we assess the fines and we take whatever dollar amount. I've kind of pulled a number out of air. But take whatever dollar amount you want. That's the right thing. Because trying to go to zero seems kind of crazy.

And, by the way, people do individually, accidentally, terrifyingly do see live murders. So one person saw it or people saw it is not actually, in fact, society destabilizing. It's unfortunate and terrible, but not that. And then you set it.

And then, by the way, it then becomes the tech company's ability to try to figure out, OK, what do we do? Do we have AI that's scanning for it? Do we have a 15 second or five minute delay or what all.

As opposed to mandating it, which is what enshrines the past against the future, you're saying, here is our economic incentive to you to continue to iterate and solve this problem in the right way, right? And then enable that to happen.

And that's, I think, the kind of pattern that you generally need to see happening with technology because it moves so fast and we want to build to the solutions of which is the better solutions are in the future.

ANDY SERWER: I know you're Mr. AI here, so obviously, you think AI is part of the solution. But it's also pretty clear, I bet you'd admit, that it's not the 100% solution. You obviously need human oversight, human intervention, human action.

So I'm curious about your understanding, your thought process when it comes to mix and if you hire more people. I mean, Zuck has hired thousands, tens of thousands of more people to try to mitigate this, but then your margins go down. Although that hasn't seemed to impact those businesses much, right? How do you feel about that?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, so I think it's totally fine to hire a bunch more people. I mean, one of the things that we have is about these global businesses. This is, again, one of the reasons why the businesses that will succeed in this stuff tend to have a very large footprint, which is one of the reasons why I, again, tend to be not-- like, if you said you want these businesses to be American businesses, to not have an antitrust, like a breakup solution.

So yes, maybe you have to hire 10,000 people. But if you're serving up billions in the world, then actually, in fact, hiring 10,000 or 50,000 people, that actually, in fact, does work. And then, of course, again, as you're inventing in the future, one of the things that you tend to do is you say, well, how do we get AI tools that even make those people more efficient and more effective?

And by way, just on your AI point, it's actually, in fact, one of the things that I help stand up and I'm the chair of the advisory board is the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. Because precisely the whole question is, how do you have a AI that has very positive human impact? Whether it's jobs, whether it's equality, or kind of a fairness in society and all those things and make sure that we're doing all of those with these very complicated AI systems?

ANDY SERWER: That's a fascinating point there about the work you're doing at Stanford. I didn't know about that. That's really amazing. Interesting. I want to ask you about China a little bit more.

There are people who are suggesting that we're going to be entering a new Cold War with China and it's going to be based on a technology rivalry. I mean, not such a far fetched or crazy notion at all. I think it's really just a question of degree. In other words, how much coopetition will there be or how dystopian and fractured will the world be along these two ecosystems, if you will?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think this is one of the things that, again, kind of back to the politics, is great that we have a change in the White House. Because you both need competition, and Americans, winning, things that are important to us.

By the way, the spread of American platforms, the dying, the Chinese, those platforms are actually a terrible, bad idea. Because say, hey, buy American technology. We're going to be buying Chinese technology. We already are today.

IPhone is kind of a mixed. Designed in Cupertino, but built in China, as an example. And so I think that the important thing is to really focus on is coopetition. Unfortunately, a little bit of the kind of competitive rhetoric, the Chinese hawks, are like, they want China to fail.

China is an important part of the global economy. If China fails, we all fail. And so I think that that bridge building is really important, while still, of course, fiercely competing and making sure that China plays its fair and just role on the world stage.

Doesn't kind of pretend it's an emerging economy anymore, isn't allowed IP theft, that kind of thing, where it's like, no, no, you have to play. We have to have a collective set of rules that we all play together that allow the world to progress.

ANDY SERWER: Maybe just to drill down a little bit more here, Reid, but isn't a bifurcated technology, economic system sort of inevitable in the sense that you're going to have a situation where they're never going to let the US, say, social media platforms in?

I don't know what's going to happen with TikTok. That seems to have been forgotten now, which is fascinating. But when it comes to chips, when it comes to Huawei and competing, you know, against Ericsson and the Western companies, isn't that really going to get worse?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it will get worse. But I think the important thing is to actually-- look, this is one of the things that I'm hopeful about in kind of a Biden administration An eternal thing is, have a technology strategy, right? Actually, in fact, be saying what are the things that we should be building to?

Because, for example, not giving up on the hardware and the chip side I think is super important. I think actually, in fact, doubling down on the things that where a lot of the deep tech AI platforms is happening over in China. The Chinese government wants to be in the lead in 2030.

Well, actually, in fact, the US ecosystems with universities, and the companies, and so forth, is in the lead today. Well, work on that. Try to maintain that. Try to make that happen. And I that's part of it. Now, I think what we'll see is we'll-- some stuff will be in China. Some stuff will be in the US. Some stuff will be in Europe.

That will be a good universe of interdependency because part of the whole-- what's awesome about capitalism, one of things is, make trade, not war. Like, as we have these interdependencies, those are actually very, very good for us in a stable world order.

And so I think we want that. But I do think that it's going to be-- look, it's going to be hard and there's going to be some definite collisions, fender benders, scratches, and it's going to take leadership to work through it.

ANDY SERWER: Let's talk about COVID, and the pandemic, and this time that we're living in, which is so crazy. But what it's done, it's exacerbated the divisions in society, not the least of which, say, were the banks, and the tech stocks, and tech companies in Silicon Valley from the rest of the US economy, never mind the rest of society.

So you had this just incredible increase in valuation of these companies now maybe coming back to Earth because of a vaccine. I mean, so what is your sort of top line thinking? Then we can drill down a little bit more after that.

REID HOFFMAN: Well, my top line thinking is, obviously, this last year is the difference between kind of reasonable government and terrible government. Because we paid trillions of dollars of debt, millions of job losses, and hundreds of thousands of lives that we didn't need to pay.

And anyone who looks at the numbers, you kind of say, OK, 5x the cases and the fatalities of the average of the rest of the world. Now, we've got some glimmerings of greatness. The Gates Foundation and companies, private enterprise going out and building vaccines at a rapid pace and all the rest of that. That's great.

But I think we need to return to a belief in science, a belief in expertise, a belief in, like Dr. Fauci, who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, is a very credible expert who's just a truth teller. It's a super important place for us to be as Americans, and that should never be politicized in any particular way.

Now, I think what that's going to come to is we're going to have another year of turbulence. Because as we figure out the kinds of things of, look, wearing a mask is part of how I'm caring for my fellow Americans, not spreading disease to them. We're going to need that.

Even as we do vaccines, I fear that we'll begin to politicize take the vaccine or not, versus the, no, no, no, my way of-- because people don't quite usually understand vaccines. They think vaccine is I'm immune. And actually, it isn't that. It's harder for me to get it.

So a lot of us have to take it to eliminate it. It's like a superpowered mask to eliminate it from the viral spread, what the experts call R0 as the incense. And we're going to need to do that. And why do we want to do that?

Well, because our productivity will be hit so much worse than basically all of these other countries. Like, than China, which, for example, I think Shanghai hasn't had a new case in like, 250 days, right? There's more cases in the White House than there is in Shanghai.

If we want to get back to an American economy, we need to get to a place where we have the disease under control and it's super important. So we should be accelerating towards that. And hopefully, by assembling experts, like that Biden has already assembled a group of great people, including someone who was one of the early whistleblowers under Trump, and say, hey, this is what we're going to pull together in order to solve this disease both for health, but also for the economy.

ANDY SERWER: But isn't it the case that sort of perversely, Reid, that when this vaccine or vaccines are out there, that the valuations of these tech companies will go down?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, some of them, and that's fine. I mean, look, the valuation of these tech companies are already so high that that's not a problem. So you've got to-- like, if the ones where investors think, oh, the only reason that's being so used is because of the pandemic, fine, we'd much rather get back to everyone going to work. And the valuation will still be more than high enough for everyone's happiness, including investors.

ANDY SERWER: So my understanding is that the VC world has been robust during this time. Is that the case? And if so, why?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, it's kind of a surprise. When we've looked at earlier kind of collisions, things that happened, including 2008 and so forth, all of this-- the VC market, generally speaking, have kind of retrenched, reserve the portfolio for the current companies, using other recessions, the internet boss and other things as a model.

And in this case, part of what happened is partially because of the LP money into the venture funds, the wide set of venture funds. I think it's because a lot of capital also thinks, OK, technology is the future, so capital around the world is looking for technology investments.

So all of that flowed in and so everyone went, well, actually, in fact, I can make this work. I can talk through Skype. I can talk through Teams. I can talk through Zoom. And I'll tell you, we at Greylock have been making a whole set of investments with teams and people we've never met, right? They've only been this little box on the screen.

Now, of course we still do the reference checking, and we still do our due diligence, and calling customers, and all the rest. But we're like, oh, look, there's-- and I think, by the way, a bunch of people are going, OK, the entrepreneurs are still like, well, we're not waiting. We're not hanging around for the pandemic.

We're building, and we're creating new things, and new available products. And at Greylock, we've been doing a lot of enterprise most recently, because we've seen all kinds of new enterprise opportunities. But there's obviously a whole range.

ANDY SERWER: That's so crazy. So you do enough due diligence so that when you finally meet this person maybe next summer you'll say, I didn't know you were tall. Everything else about you, I knew--

REID HOFFMAN: Yes, exactly.

ANDY SERWER: --or that kind of thing.

REID HOFFMAN: Exactly.

ANDY SERWER: One thing we haven't touched on that much, you mentioned inequality a little bit. And I want to ask what you're doing and what venture can specifically do to address racial and social bias.

REID HOFFMAN: So racial and social bias is one of the things we have. It's a stain on our entire society, and especially some areas like obviously tech and investing are, just by the numbers, clearly retrograde in this.

And so it's one of those places where you have to look at yourself and say, if I'm not part of the solution, then I'm part of the problem. And so Greylock, for example, we looked at this and said, look, the key thing is to make sure there's a whole bunch of great people of color, minority, other kind of things, disadvantaged minority talent out there.

We just need to build a network connectivity so that they have connectivity to investment if they're founders to these early companies, if they're kind of professionals and executives. And so we did that. So we said, OK, let's dive deep.

And we did a partnership with Management Leaders of Tomorrow, which, founded and CO by John Rice, who is the brother of Susan Rice, who has already spent well over a decade building these pathways for how do you identify great talent.

And now we're going to try to help map that talent into the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. And we're-- one of the things that we do at Greylock is we pride ourselves on being good partners with entrepreneurs, but even with other investors.

And we say, OK, let's try to make sure that that whole talent network is connected well throughout the entire Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. Because ultimately, that's how you get to kind of the fairness, to the justice.

Which is, you have those network pathways by which people can then find the right opportunities. And so that's one of n things that we're doing at Greylock in order to try to be kind of good protagonists of the future.

ANDY SERWER: I know you could probably talk about this for an hour or more. But what are a few things that you look for when you're trying to identify a successful startup, Reid?

REID HOFFMAN: So generally speaking, it can be different patterns. But the simple stuff is, oh my gosh, this could be an industry transforming company where the time is now. Sometimes because of technology change, sometimes because of market change, other kinds of things.

That the founder has enough of the raw knowledge to get moving, and is a learner, and has that raw kind of grit and adaptability to go through all of the different phases that these startups go through. Like, the example in my last book, ""Blitzscaling,"" I kind of described those five phases of size.

And the rules change at each phase of size. Like, how you run the company, what management looks like, are you multithreaded, single threaded? And then you can do all that. And then where do you look at relative to competition?

Because one of the really fundamental things, which I just did in my most recent kind of ""Greymatter"" podcast and essay, was that competition, like, what does the competition look like, is really central to how you do it.

So that's the suite at which you look at. And then that suite, you kind of go, OK, and then it's art and science. You can't just kind of pencil the numbers. It isn't just do a DCS analysis. It's like, yeah, I think so.

ANDY SERWER: Right, right. Great. And finally, Reid, you have seen millions of profiles on LinkedIn. And so I'm curious, what advice do you have for people who are applying to jobs online right now amid COVID-19 and how do they stand out from the competition?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think that some of the things are put extra energy into it. Like, for example, one of the features, a small thing on LinkedIn is I like having references. Having, like-- but even if you're mailings say, hey, here's three people from-- like, you would say, here's three people who would be references for me and here's the link to their LinkedIn profile.

So people are, OK, showing that different thing. Like, another thing that I've kind of encouraged both companies individuals to do is while, generally speaking, I think recording a video interview of yourself in a normal thing is probably not that useful.

In this time of COVID, it is very useful, right? Because people are sitting, watching screens all the time. It's like, OK, watch another video. So record a little video about why you're interested in this job, who you are, and here's my link to my LinkedIn profile or wherever you're kind of storing your professional credentials. I think that's very helpful.

And then, of course, always try to use your network so that people understand that you are hardworking, collaborative, and other kinds of things which are the attributes you generally only get through references or network.

ANDY SERWER: Reid Hoffman, thank you so much for your time and best of luck to you.

REID HOFFMAN: Thank you, Andy. Always a pleasure.

90,2020-11-10T16:28:24+00:00,5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers,"- By Robert Abbott

There's growth, and then there's super-growth. Using the GuruFocus Fast Growers screener, we can find stocks that have a history of strong growth. This screener measures growth through the five-year revenue per share growth rate, the five-year Ebitda per share growth rate, the 10-year revenue per share growth rate and the 10-year Ebitda per share growth rate.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA. Click here to check it out.  BABA 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of BABA Peter Lynch Chart of BABA

According to these screening criteria, the below stocks were the fastest growers on the market as of Nov. 9: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

Alibaba

China's equivalent to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), roughly speaking, has become a giant since it went public in 2014. Co-founded by Jack Ma in 1999, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) now has a market cap of just under $800 billion and could soon become a trillion-dollar company.

As the table above shows, its five-year revenue per share growth rate has been exceptional, as has been its five-year Ebitda per share growth rate.

Alibaba generates revenue and Ebitda through four operating segments: core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment and innovation initiatives.

Growth is driven by many factors, not least among them:

A shift to online shopping, especially since the Coronavirus pandemic The growing Chinese middle class and expanding disposable incomes Economies of scale The application of capital to fast-growing technologies

As fellow GuruFocus contributor Ben Reynolds wrote last year, ""The company continues to grow much more quickly than the Chinese economy as it takes full advantage of its growing suite of products and services that appeal to a wide variety of Chinese consumers and businesses alike.""

It also boasts one of the strongest sets of fundamentals among all publicly-traded companies: GuruFocus rates its financial strength 8 out of 10 and its profitability 9 out of 10.

Story continues

Alibaba does not pay a dividend and its share buyback ratio over the past three years has been negative. The GuruFocus Value chart finds it to be fairly-valued. It was held by 36 gurus at the end of the second quarter.

Patrick Industries

A small-cap stock, Patrick Industries Inc (NASDAQ:PATK) has a market cap of $1.28 billion. Its manufacturing segment, responsible for 70% of sales, sells laminated and vinyl products, including furniture, shelving and countertops. Its distribution segment, with 30% of sales, sells mainly prefinished wall and ceiling panels to the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries.

The Elkhart, Indiana-based company's 10-year revenue per share growth rate was 27.6% and its 10-year Ebitda per share growth rate was 42.30%. The five and 10-year revenue growth rates are about the same, while the 10-year Ebitda growth rate was roughly 11 points higher than the five-year rate; this suggests the company has become less efficient in the past five years.

What drives its growth? In its 10-K for 2019, the company reported:

""The Company's strategic and capital allocation strategy is to optimally manage and utilize its resources and leverage its platform of operating brands to continue to grow and reinvest in its business.""

Tactically, Patrick Industries lists these initiatives:

Strategic acquisitions, Geographic expansion Expansion into new product lines Investment in infrastructure and capital expenditures

It has taken on a lot of debt in recent years, which helps account for the 5 out of 10 rating for financial strength. It also has some of the best margins in the vehicles and parts industry, leading to an 8 out of 10 rating for profitability.

Its dividend yield is 1.85%, and over the past three years it has had a negative share buyback ratio. The GuruFocus Value chart finds the stock to be fairly valued, while the PEG ratio, at 0.58, suggests the stock is undervalued. Patrick Industries is held by two gurus, Chuck Royce (Trades, Portfolio) of Royce & Associates and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) of Renaissance Technologies.

Netflix

No introduction is needed for the world-famous streaming service giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Over the past five and 10 years, it has grown its revenue per share by 29.20% and 25.20% respectively, and its Ebitda per share by 30.10% and 39.40%, respectively. Like Patrick Industries, Netflix has been less efficient over the past five years.

It explained its growth in the risk section of its most recent 10-K as follows:

""Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships.""

Whatever its model, Netflix has been wildly successful, as shown in this comparative chart in the 10-K: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

Because of its increasing debt load, it earns only a 5 out of 10 rating for financial strength. On the other hand, the rating for profitability is very good at 9 out of 10.

It pays no dividend and has not increased its earnings per share with buybacks. The GuruFocus Value chart lists Netflix as being fairly-valued, while the PEG ratio shows overvaluation at 2.76. Twenty-two of the gurus followed by GuruFocus had positions in the stock as of June 30.

Ubiquiti

Based in New York City, Ubiquiti Inc. (NYSE:UI) described itself this way in its 10-K for 2020:

""We develop technology platforms for high-capacity distributed Internet access, unified information technology, and consumer electronics for professional, home and personal use. We categorize our solutions into three main categories: high performance networking technology for service providers, enterprises and consumers. We target the service provider and enterprise markets through our highly engaged community of service providers, distributors, value added resellers, systems integrators and corporate IT professionals, which we refer to as the Ubiquiti Community. We target consumers through digital marketing, retail chains and, to a lesser extent, the Ubiquiti Community.""

Its revenue per share has grown at a rate of 25.10% in the past five years and 23.50% in the past 10 years. Ebitda growth averaged 27.80% per year over the last five years and 34.40% per year over the last 10 years. In this case, Ebitda and profitability slipped in the past half-decade.

Ubiquiti is a tech company and is driven by research and development. In fact, the company reported, ""the majority of our human capital resources consist of entrepreneurial and de-centralized research and development (""R&D"") personnel."" Specifically, 714 of its 1,021 employees work in R&D.

It does not employ a sales force, relying instead on online reviews, its distributors and its user communities. The latter can connect directly with R&D, marketing and support teams.

Because it has a strong R&D operation, the company has a portfolio of patents and proprietary technologies. It combines these with low-cost hardware to build lower-priced solutions for its customers. These solutions become integrated with the hardware and software of its customers, thus ensuring it loses few customers.

Its debt has grown in recent years, so it receives only a 5 out of 10 rating for financial strength. Its profitability, though, is as good as it gets, a rare 10 out of 10, spurred partially by a return on equity (ROE) of more than 52%.

It pays a dividend of 0.5%, which is unexpected for a growth-focused tech company. Share buybacks are also on the management menu, as the share buyback ratio over the past three years was 7.4. This should push up earnings per share significantly if it keeps going. According to the GuruFocus Value chart, Ubiquiti's share price is significantly overvalued. The PEG ratio is 1.54, which suggests a much lower level of overvaluation. Seven of the gurus followed by GuruFocus have positions in the stock.

Five Below

Based in Philadelphia, Five Below Inc (NASDAQ:FIVE) is defying the trend away from brick and mortar businesses. It operated more than 900 stores in the U.S. at the end of 2019. They cater to teen and preteen consumers, with a wide assortment of merchandise mostly priced at or below $6.00.

Leisure products, including sporting goods, toys and electronics, were the biggest sellers, making up 50% of last year's sales. It also offers merchandise in the fashion and home categories as well as the party and snack goods categories. It had stores in 36 U.S. states and four distribution centers at the end of 2019.

As it has grown over the past decade, it has increased its revenue consistently: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

It has also grown its Ebitda consistently: 5 Fast-Growing Super-Achievers

What's behind these growth numbers? This information from the 10-K for 2019 gives us several clues:

""We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a differentiated merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept, which allows our customers to ""Let Go and Have Fun."" Based on our management's experience and industry knowledge, we believe our customer-centric, experience-first, innovative approach to retail has led to a fiercely loyal customer base and has fostered universal appeal across a variety of age groups beyond our target demographic.""

In other words, a unique shopping experience targeted to its core market of preteens and teens provides its advantage. It also involves ""trend-right"" merchandise, a clear value proposition, a differentiated shopping experience, a powerful store model and a team of passionate managers.

After taking on new debt this year, the company receives a financial strength rating of 6 out of 10 from the GuruFocus system. Its profitability rating is high at 9 out of 10.

Five Below does not issue dividends and its share buyback ratio for the past three years is negative. It is modestly overvalued according to the GuruFocus Value chart. The PEG ratio is in the same territory at 3.25. Among the gurus, four owned the stock at the end of the second quarter.

Conclusion

Alibaba, Patrick Industries, Netflix, Ubiquiti and Five Below are fast-growing stocks that have rewarded their shareholders, even though most do not pay dividends or buy back their shares. They are growth companies with high profitability.

Profitability opens many doors for corporations with ambitious plans. It means more funding for new lines of business, expansion of existing lines and strategic acquisitions. Subject to each investor's own due diligence, I think these may be attractive candidates.

Overall, though, they would best fit into the plans of growth investors. Value investors won't find underpriced, debt-free names here, at least not for now. Income investors also will want to look elsewhere for more mature companies that have established competitive dividends.

91,2020-11-09T01:39:46+00:00,375% Return on One Startup to Help SoftBank Get Past WeWork,"(Bloomberg) -- As Softbank Group Corp. tries to rebuild its reputation as a startup investor, the Japanese conglomerate will be able to point to several recent successes, including an obscure Chinese property startup that pulled off a blockbuster initial public offering.

SoftBank invested $1.35 billion last November in a Beijing-based company called KE Holdings Inc., which went public this August. Shares in the company, also known as Beike, soared from offering through Sept. 30 to lift the value of SoftBank’s reported stake to $6.4 billion, a 375% return. KE’s stock is up another 20% since the quarter’s close.

SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is certain to highlight such winners when he announces quarterly earnings results on Nov. 9. The Japanese billionaire scored hits early in his career by backing Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! Inc. But his reputation suffered from recent troubles at other startups, including the office-sharing firm WeWork, leading to record losses in the last fiscal year.

“SoftBank is recovering from the worst,” Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities Co. “Internet companies can lead to huge returns. It should be okay for SoftBank to find one company that will become like Alibaba in future.”

SoftBank shares rose as much as 5.2% on Monday and have gained almost 50% this year.

The KE investment, coupled with likely gains on several American tech giants, could help SoftBank surpass estimates for the second fiscal quarter. The company is expected to report 150.3 billion yen ($1.4 billion) of net income for the three months ended Sept. 30, according to the mean consensus by three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. It posted a 700 billion yen loss for the quarter a year earlier.

Estimating earnings for the company has grown increasingly difficult as it moved away from the predictable telecom industry into complex financial instruments. The firm said in August it will stop disclosing its operating income as it doesn’t reflect gains from its securities investments and dividend.

Story continues

In October, Son talked up Beike at SoftBank World, an event he holds annually to explain the company and its startups. He highlighted how the company uses artificial intelligence to match buyers and sellers in the Chinese property market.

“It is an awesome firm,” Son said, showing graphics to detail the company’s business. “It’s growing rapidly and posting huge profits already.”

SoftBank has engineered a comeback this year after missteps with startups like WeWork and concerns about fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. It unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen in assets and buy back a record 2.5 trillion yen of its own stock, pushing shares to a two-decade high in October.

The IPO market has also improved, opening the door for SoftBank portfolio companies to go public. ByteDance Ltd., the developer of the TikTok app and backed by Son, is considering a listing in Hong Kong, Bloomberg News reported. Even WeWork expects to revisit plans for an IPO after its disastrous attempt in 2019.

“With investors getting used to the COVID-19 pandemic, unicorn stocks are appreciating,” Yoshio Ando, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co., said in a report dated Oct. 26. “We expect Softbank Group’s profile to change dramatically this year. We look to the firm to navigate its way through a world unknown to investors.”

WeWork’s New CEO Is Eyeing an IPO Again - After He Turns Profit

SoftBank also benefited from the Nasdaq’s strong third quarter. If it held its stakes in Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and 23 other U.S. firms disclosed in U.S. securities filings for the period, its paper gain would be about $570 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg. The return for those securities was 15%, compared with 11% for the index.

Son has increasingly discouraged investors and analysts from focusing on quarterly profit -- one of the reasons he eliminated the disclosure of operating income. While profit was a reasonable indicator of performance when SoftBank was primarily a telecom operator, it’s less relevant as the company has evolved into an investment holding company, he has said.

Accounting rules mean that investment gains or losses are treated differently on SoftBank’s income statements if they come from the Vision Fund or the parent company -- even though the effect on the company is essentially the same. He would prefer investors focus on the value of SoftBank’s holdings, like its stakes in Alibaba and KE Holdings, rather than net income.

“What is more important is the shareholder value,” he said on the earnings call in August.

SoftBank has engineered a comeback this year after missteps with startups like WeWork and concerns about fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. It unveiled plans to sell 4.5 trillion yen in assets and buy back a record 2.5 trillion yen of its own stock, pushing shares to a two-decade high in October.

The IPO market has also improved, opening the door for SoftBank portfolio companies to go public. ByteDance Ltd., the developer of the TikTok app and backed by Son, is considering a listing in Hong Kong, Bloomberg News reported. Even WeWork expects to revisit plans for an IPO after its disastrous attempt in 2019.

“With investors getting used to the COVID-19 pandemic, unicorn stocks are appreciating,” Yoshio Ando, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co., said in a report dated Oct. 26. “We expect Softbank Group’s profile to change dramatically this year. We look to the firm to navigate its way through a world unknown to investors.”

SoftBank also benefited from the Nasdaq’s strong third quarter. If it held its stakes in Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and 23 other U.S. firms disclosed in U.S. securities filings for the period, its paper gain would be about $570 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg. The return for those securities was 15%, compared with 11% for the index.

Son has increasingly discouraged investors and analysts from focusing on quarterly profit -- one of the reasons he eliminated the disclosure of operating income. While profit was a reasonable indicator of performance when SoftBank was primarily a telecom operator, it’s less relevant as the company has evolved into an investment holding company, he has said.

Accounting rules mean that investment gains or losses are treated differently on SoftBank’s income statements if they come from the Vision Fund or the parent company -- even though the effect on the company is essentially the same. He would prefer investors focus on the value of SoftBank’s holdings, like its stakes in Alibaba and KE Holdings, rather than net income.

“What is more important is the shareholder value,” he said on the earnings call in August.

93,2020-10-30T12:14:32+00:00,7 Penny Stocks to Watch in November,"In recent years, penny stocks have become a go-to investment for their low cost. These types of stocks usually trade below the five-dollar mark, making them ideal for first-time investors as well. Although, penny stocks have their fair share of critics, the investment has garnered a cult following over the years. Many find it to be a lucrative investment avenue.

Penny stocks are especially popular in periods of economic uncertainty, as investors look for assets with a low capital cost.

But although penny stocks trade at a low price, there are known for their high volatility. This means they can make huge moves in a single day, generating high returns.

7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave

Given that penny stocks come with high risk, it is essential that you pick the stocks that show strong growth potential. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the top penny stocks to watch in November. None of these are sure bets, but they all have growth opportunities:

Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Titan Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TTNP) Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH) Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX) Rolls Royce Holdings (OTCMKTS:RYCEY) Neos Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NEOS) Cinedigm Corp (NASDAQ:CIDM)

It’s no secret that Nokia (NYSE:NOK) had a tough year, and its latest earnings didn’t help matters. The telecom giant reached a high of $5.14 in August before falling to $3.35 this month.

But, there are some events suggest that things are finally taking a turn for the better. The Finnish company announced that it has secured a $14.1 million grant from NASA to create a cellular network to the moon.

Nokia will partner with Intuitive Mechanics to build a 4G/LTE network to the moon by 2022. The goal is to create a communications hub for future missions and enable better exploration of habitation on the moon.

The biotech space saw a lot of action this year as the race to the Covid vaccine pushes full steam ahead. While Titan Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TTNP) is not a major contender for the vaccine, it does create therapeutics to treat chronic illnesses. TTNP stock is down 39.31% this year but shows promise for future growth.

On Sept. 15, Titan Pharmaceuticals announced that its partner company, Molteni entered a deal with Accord Healthcare. The healthcare company will commercialize and distribute Sixmo in the EU. According to Titan, “Sixmo is indicated for substitution treatment for opioid dependence in clinically stable adult patients.”

This could translate to increased revenue for Titan and improve its bottom line.

TTNP has been on an upward trend this past week and could keep going higher. Keep an eye on this penny stock.

Another industry that has seen a lot of activity this year is the food delivery services. As people work and play from home, food delivery has now become an essential service. One company that has benefitted from this trend is Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ:WTRH). Dubbed as “mini Uber eats,” Waitr stock is up roughly 700% this year.

Unlike larger companies like Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER) and Postmates, Waitr serves smaller communities. The company’s share price went as high as $5.85 this year before falling back to $2.57 this month. However, Waitr shows signs of its momentum picking up once again thanks to a tableside service app.

The new technology will allow customers to order food and pay their bill by scanning a QR code on the Waitr app. This means customers can enjoy a meal at a restaurant with zero contact. The pandemic is likely to change traditional dining as we know it and Waitr’s savvy new app caters to this “new normal.” If that takes off, then WTRH stock could as well.

Dynavax stock (DVAX) a gold and clear pill capsule contains a representation of a DNA molecule

Another penny stock that is a beneficiary of the biotech momentum is Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX). The company uses cutting-edge technology to produce vaccines for the masses. The stock is currently trading at $4.16 and analyst estimate the price could go higher.

This confidence stems in part from Dynavax’s involvement in the Covid-19 vaccine race. But it’s not developing the vaccine itself. Rather, it’s developing an adjuvant to be delivered in combination with Medigen’s vaccine. The dual therapy has been granted a subsidy by Taiwan’s government and clinical trials have begun.

And analysts also expect to see a resurgence in sales for its hepatitis B treatment, Heplisav-B. Maybe that’s why the analysts’ consensus price target is $12, suggesting over 200% upside.

If either of these two options takes off, it could make this penny stock well worth your time.

The name Rolls Royce Holdings (OTCMKTS:RYCEY) is often synonymous with luxury cars, but the actual company has little to do with the auto industry itself. Rolls Royce Holdings is in fact a major player in the engineering space and creates technology for aerospace, big data and defense.

But as pandemic brought its aerospace segment to a halt, the other businesses are picking up the slack.

Rolls Royce recently announced a new R&D investment in its Power Systems business for $13.9 million. The goal behind the investment is to grow its power generation facility in Minnesota. The company is one of nine members chosen to build a nuclear power station in the U.K. This is in an effort to reduce carbon emissions in the country. This power segment will be a huge growth driver for RYCYE stock in the future.

Neos Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NEOS) is another innovative company making waves this year. The company creates treatments for people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Neos hit some major lows these past few years but is finally putting its dark days behind. Trading at just 70 cents per share, the penny stock is a steal at this price

Sales of the company’s amphetamine treatment of ADHD became stagnant during the pandemic. However, as classes go back in session via remote learning, sales of the medication are picking up. In addition to this, the company has also introduced a new co-pay program, Rx Connect. The goal behind this innovation is to increase the profitability of each prescription.

Digital entertainment has become the next big thing this year as theatres remain closed for the foreseeable future. Cinedigm Corp (NASDAQ:CIDM) is an entertainment company with a growing presence in this sector. The company distributes its products for Hallmark and Televisa (NYSE:TV) among others while also partnering with bigger players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Although Cinedigm Corp has been on a downward trend, the company recently announced that it will be expanding its digital streaming segment through television. It has already secured partnerships with Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Samsung to spearhead this development. The new expansion will allow Cinedigm to reach over 15.2 million eyeballs.

At a current price of just 50 cents, CIDM is a penny stock that’s worth watching in November.

94,2020-10-29T10:30:15+00:00,We Have Learned to Live Without Movie Theaters,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the Covid-19 pandemic wears on and drives permanent changes to entertainment culture, Hollywood giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures appear to be turning their backs somewhat on movie theaters. The largest among the cinema chains, AMC Entertainment Inc., is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy at the same time that it celebrates its 100th anniversary. Just a few short months ago, it seemed inconceivable that the business of filmmaking could carry on without the box office and surrender almost entirely to online streaming apps. But now it’s clear that Hollywood and audiences can get along without cinemas.

More than $7 billion of market value has vanished from AMC, Cineworld Group Plc and Cinemark Holdings Inc. this year. Although the financial picture is less bleak at Cinemark, Cineworld has hired advisers to help with its balance sheet, and AMC may run out of funds before the new year. “AMC’s cash burn could worsen beyond $115 million a month, while its cash reserves are only about $418 million,” Amine Bensaid, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a report last week. Leawood, Kansas-based AMC is controlled by Dalian Wanda Group Co. of China, where the industry is healthier; China, in fact, recently overtook North America as the world’s largest movie market. Netflix Inc.’s annual revenue also tops the U.S. box office and has for some time. The symbolism weighs heavy on U.S. cinephiles, and the reality of it has studios rethinking strategy.Last month’s weak theatrical showing from Warner Bros.’s “Tenet” and strong streaming debut of Disney’s “Mulan” suggest that theaters either reopened too soon and consumers weren’t ready, or that they’ve already lost their relevance. Mask requirements have also hurt sales at concessions, which theaters crucially depend on for about a third of total revenue. While studios — along with everyone else — were hopeful that things would be back to normal by fall or winter, cases are instead surging again, with some news headlines mirroring those from March and April.

Story continues

Disney has since pushed back a number of its upcoming releases, including delaying Marvel’s “Black Widow” to May 2021, a full year from when it was originally scheduled. The same goes for MGM’s “No Time to Die,” which is now set to arrive in April, although the studio reportedly held talks about selling the film to Apple Inc. or Netflix for their streaming services. Even as key New York and California theaters reopen, all signs point to weak demand until the U.S. gets a handle on the coronavirus. Only 26% of millennials — and far fewer baby boomers — say they’re comfortable returning to movie theaters right now, according to a weekly Morning Consult poll. Attitudes toward concerts, gyms, theme parks and overseas travel are much the same.

No one would have predicted a sudden pandemic would cripple the entertainment industry all at once. But clouds were forming over movie theaters long ago and companies like AMC failed to prepare. Disney’s blockbusters had almost single-handedly propped up the box office in recent years, and rising ticket prices helped mask traffic trends. Disney’s “Avengers: Endgame” grossed $2.8 billion in 2019, making it the biggest film of all time. Still, 162 million fewer tickets were sold in North America that year compared with 20 years ago, according to The Numbers, a box-office data provider. Theater owners responded by renovating auditoriums, improving snack options, installing reclining seats and — buying one another.

Between 2016 and 2017, AMC acquired its rural U.S. rival Carmike Cinemas, Odeon & UCI in London and Sweden’s Nordic Cinema Group for a total of $3 billion including debt. London-based Cineworld Group Plc bought America’s second-biggest chain, Regal, for $5.9 billion. The virus scuttled its plan to buy Canada’s Cineplex Inc.

In a November 2018 earnings call, Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC, highlighted the company’s spending, pointing to its “robust dividend” and a $160 million special payout made to shareholders that year after it secured a large investment from a private equity firm. He also said that AMC repurchased some $500 million of stock, doubled its Dolby locations in the U.S. and was “renovating theaters like crazy in Europe.” Capital expenditures ballooned, and interest expense on AMC’s mounting debt began to eat up its operating profit — all before Covid entered the vernacular:

While the costly investments may have seemed wise at the time, they look much different through the lens of a Covid face shield. A strategy focused on fewer locations in the most profitable markets would have better prepared the industry for what’s to come in 2021: a massive downsizing.

AMC was among companies irked by the effects of a Financial Accounting Standards Board rule change last year that reclassified operating leases as debt, and its executives weren’t shy about saying so. The modification increased debt levels overnight and complicated the calculations of already squishy financial metrics used to compare businesses. After Covid shut AMC’s doors, though, the debt-like burden of those contractually obligated lease payments went from hypothetical to very real. In August, AMC said it reached agreements with landlords to “defer or abate rent” on about 75% of its 900 leases.

That was more than two months ago, and Covid-19 still hasn’t let up. It doesn’t look like a vaccine will fully thwart its spread in 2021 either. AMC and its rivals have no choice but to retreat from areas where the box office shows low odds of recuperating. Even then, how many theaters that remain can survive a streamer’s world?

96,2020-10-27T13:09:01+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy From the Prospering Entertainment Industry,"Companies of the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry like ViacomCBS (VIAC), News Corporation (NWSA) and Lionsgate (LGF.A) are some of the major beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic-led demand for media, music and news. The closure of movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines and restriction on travelling helped drive demand for digital entertainment despite coronavirus-induced production disruption.

Moreover, a steady recovery in the advertising spending environment bodes well for film and television production companies.

Industry Description

The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors.

The companies are heavily dependent on box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases and ratings of TV shows.

3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends to Watch Out For

Over-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are increasingly producing original and award-winning feed to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.

Binge Watching Driving Consumption: Moreover, factors such as binge watching, deepening Internet penetration and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. Emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preference. This is helping them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales & marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streamers like Netflix.

Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience. Increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.

ViacomCBS: This New York-based company’s solid cable network portfolio is a major growth driver. Growing traction of Showtime, BET, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon is expected to drive top-line growth.

In order to centralize a number of functional areas, the company launched a Shared Services program. The company is also well positioned to grab opportunities generated from technology sharing across geographies and businesses, and bundle offerings of enriched content to consumers and advertising partners.

News Corporation’s shares have lost 3.4% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #2 company’s fiscal 2021 earnings has been steady at 21 cents per share over the past 30 days.

Price and Consensus: NWSA

Lionsgate: The company is expected to benefit from a spurt in viewership of Starz’s content across all platforms as well as an increase in subscriber base of its OTT platforms as media consumption surged amid the coronavirus outbreak. Further, increased home-entertainment and library revenues, driven by strong demand for content and revenues, is a key catalyst. The Starz acquisition has helped Lionsgate strengthen its competitive position and maximize returns along with building a diversified portfolio for long-term growth.

Moreover, with people confined to their homes, the coronavirus outbreak has increased television and streaming consumption around the globe. This trend is benefiting Starz, which has experienced an increase in viewership of its content across all platforms as well as an increase in subscribers to its OTT services. Moreover, rising home entertainment demand bodes well for this Zacks Rank #2 company’s top line.

Lionsgate’s shares have lost 31.8% year to date. The consensus mark for its fiscal 2021 earnings has been steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days.

97,2020-10-20T00:36:10+00:00,SoftBank Amasses Over $20 Billion in Public Stock Unit,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. charged ahead with its new public stock trading arm, increasing equity positions to more than $20 billion despite an initially skeptical response from shareholders, according to a person familiar with the investments.

Bloomberg reported in August that SoftBank had been targeting more than $10 billion and that the sum could reach into the tens of billions. The Japanese conglomerate considered tempering its trading plans in early September after reports that SoftBank’s spending spree was stirring froth in tech stocks. The news erased about $9 billion in market value for SoftBank at the time.

Over the past few weeks, SoftBank renewed its commitment to the public equities trading arm, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The strategy is currently built around expectations of a volatile third-quarter earnings season, the people said. SoftBank has been buying out-of-the-money call options, which deliver returns when share prices rise, and selling calls at even higher prices, one of the people said. Call spreads, as they’re known, cap gains but reduce the initial cost.

A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment. Shares fell about 1.5% in Tokyo trading after hitting a new 20-year high on Monday.

Earnings season is proving to be especially unpredictable. On Oct. 12, the Nasdaq 100 index underwent the biggest rally since April, and options-derived measures of volatility also rose.

An unidentified trader recently purchased around $200 million worth of call contracts on tech stocks in a single day. Call open interest in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. has averaged 12.9 million contracts over the 30 days through Monday, the highest since early 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank founder who’s leading the effort to create the equities arm inside his company, has been reluctant to provide many details about his trading strategy. The company has talked more about a broader strategy of selling assets, paring debt and buying back shares that has been well-received by investors. The stock rose to a 20-year high Monday, the highest level since March 2000 in the midst of the dot-com boom.

Story continues

In August, SoftBank disclosed holdings of $3.9 billion in stocks such as Amazon, which reports financial results on Oct. 29, and Netflix, which reports Tuesday. It has bought a lot more stock since then. While focusing on major tech stocks, SoftBank has also been expanding to smaller companies. Last week, it invested $215 million in Norway-based Kahoot, which makes education software.

That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades as earnings season gets into full swing.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Procter & Gamble (PG) Top stock trades for PG

Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) quietly remains in a tight trading range near its highs as it gets set to report earnings on Tuesday before the open.

From here, bulls are looking for a breakout over the current range or a dip into support. If it’s the former, look for shares to clear $145.50 and rally up to the 161.8% extension at $147.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

A close above $147 puts $150-plus on the table.

On the downside, I want to see shares find support at prior resistance near $140 and the 20-day moving average at $141.25. Below could put the 50-day moving average in play, currently near $138.50.

As long as it holds up in this area, buying the dip doesn’t appear to be a horrendous plan.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Netflix (NFLX) Top stock trades for NFLX

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will also report earnings on Tuesday, but will do so after the close. This one has been very interesting. Although it’s a play on the novel coronavirus, it has had trouble breaking out of its incredibly wide trading range.

On the downside, shares are supported by the $465 area and the 161.8% extension. On the upside, the stock is capped by the $560 to $575 zone and the 261.8% extension.

Hovering closer to the latter zone than the former, bulls have to be thinking about a breakout on earnings. For me, I would love to see this one clear $580 — the top of the range — and remove any question marks about whether the reaction is bullish or not.

Doing so would put the three-time extension in play near $598, followed by a move into the $600s.

Story continues

On the downside, look to see if NFLX holds the 50-day moving average on a dip. Below puts that $465 to $470 area back in play. Below the 161.8% extension and Netflix may very well test the 200-day moving average.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: International Business Machines (IBM) Top stock trades for IBM

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

Keeping with the earnings theme, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is set to report earnings on Monday after the close.

IBM recently gave investors good news, as it looks to shift more toward growth by splitting up its business. However, the stock could not close above the 200-week moving average on a weekly basis, which has been resistance since the coronavirus selloff started.

Given how much of a laggard IBM has been, I’m not that interested in it on a dip. If it holds the 10-week and 50-week moving averages, then it still leaves bulls in a good spot. Below and they’ll have to hope $120 holds — and hope is never a reliable strategy.

On the upside, this name needs to clear and hold the 200-week moving average. Above puts this month’s high in play near $135.

With IBM in particular, I’d rather miss the bottom and buy with momentum than look for a dip to get long, as this one has lagged the overall markets so badly.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Halliburton (HAL) Top stock trades for HAL

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is about flat on earnings, which is better than collapsing lower, but it still needs to prove itself.

Shares remain trapped below the 20-day moving average. A rotation above this mark and this month’s high near $13 will put a test of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages on the table.

Above that and HAL could start to squeeze higher, potentially putting $17 in play.

On the downside, a break of $11.70 puts the October low in play at $10.60. Below that and the $9.60 mark is in play, followed by the 23.6% retracement at $9.20.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Alpha Pro Tech (APT) Top stock trades for APT

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

Alpha Pro Tech (NYSEAMERICAN:APT) found itself trending on Monday, as shares popped more than 11% as of this writing.

While $16 has been a notable level in the past, I would like to see APT stock close above this month’s high at $17.08. Above that mark opens the door to $20-plus and potentially puts $24 resistance on the table.

If the stock can clear $16 to $17, see that it holds the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Below puts the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) on the table.

I would be concerned with APT stock if it closed below $12.

99,2020-10-18T15:10:47+00:00,"Netflix, Tesla report earnings results: What to know in the week ahead","Earnings season is set to pick up this week, giving investors a better picture of the state of corporate profitability amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Results from last week were dominated by the big banks, which largely reported better than feared third-quarter results on the back of strong trading revenues and lighter reserve builds relative to the first half of this year.

So far, about 10% of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly results. Of these, 86% topped consensus expectations for earnings per share, according to data from FactSet as of Friday. The blended earnings decline for the third quarter – comprising of both actual and expected results – is so far 18.4%, or slightly better than the about 20% earnings drop the Street was bracing for heading into earnings season.

This week, a plethora of companies across industries are set to report results, including more airline carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), consumer giants including Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola (KO), and health care companies Biogen (BIIB) and Quest Diagnostics (DGX).

Reports from a couple of 2020’s closely watched tech names are expected to be a particular focal point. Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is set to report quarterly earnings results Tuesday after the bell, and Tesla (TSLA) is poised to deliver results late Wednesday.

Netflix

Netflix, a darling of the stay-at-home trade, has so far added a decelerating number of new subscribers over the course of 2020, following an initial surge in sign-ups during the first wave of stay-in-place orders.

Last quarter, Netflix disappointed investors after saying third-quarter global net subscriber additions would total 2.5 million, representing a major step down from the record performance Netflix posted for the first half of the year. More than 10 million subscribers joined Netflix during the second quarter, and nearly 16 million paying users were brought on during the first.

Story continues

“We’re expecting paid net adds will be down year-over-year in the second half as our strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year,” the company said in its July shareholder update.

Still, Wall Street has interpreted Netflix’s guidance as overly conservative. Consensus analysts are looking for new paid streamers to total 3.3 million, according to Bloomberg data, with the majority of these new users coming from less streaming-saturated geographies including Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and the Asia Pacific region. And while subscribers are expected to decelerate sequentially, Netflix’s revenue growth is expected to hold up more robustly, with sales growing 22% over last year to nearly $6.4 billion after a 25% growth rate in the June quarter. The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Netflix’s commentary around its outlook for late-2020 and early-2021 will also be closely watched. For the quarter ending in September, Netflix’s release schedule was somewhat lighter than in quarters prior, with “The Baby-Sitters Club,” “The Last Dance” and the second season of “The Umbrella Academy” among the highlights.

But looking ahead, the threat of a lighter content release schedule looms for Netflix and other streaming companies, with the pandemic and potential for a second wave of the virus having upended studios’ production schedules this year.

“We expect to gain more clarity on the company's content pipeline and any disruptions caused by pandemic-related production pauses,” Raymond James analysts Andrew Marok and Aaron Kessler, who rate Netflix as Market Perform, wrote in a recent note.

“While we continue to view Netflix as a long-term winner in the video-on-demand space, we remain hesitant around near-term factors including 1) uncertainty around the pace of subscriber additions post-pandemic; 2) the impact of the pandemic on content releases into 2021; and 3) the company's pricing power as new DTC services compete for market share,” they added.

Tesla

Tesla’s 425% stock run-up year-to-date has made it the second-best performer in the Nasdaq 100, bested only by Zoom Video Communication’s (ZM) more than 700% gain.

The company’s third-quarter results come after the company reported a record number of deliveries for the three months to September, bucking the trend of the broader auto industry, after most legacy automakers reported another quarter of declines.

Yet, Tesla’s 139,300 third-quarter deliveries still put the company’s previously stated goal of around 500,000 deliveries for 2020 at a stretch, according to most Wall Street analysts. For the year-to-date, Tesla has handed over nearly 319,000 electric vehicles, driven mostly by demand for the lower-priced Model 3 and newer Model Y.

“While we expect Tesla to maintain its target of 500k deliveries in ‘20, we believe it will be hard pressed to reach its target, as it would need to produce near capacity for all of 4Q,” Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy, who rates Tesla shares as Neutral, said in a note last week. “Yet even if Tesla misses its 500k target, we expected investors to look through it as the longer-term growth narrative is intact.”

Analysts anticipate 2020 volume will be about 486,000, which would still be within the guidance range CEO Elon Musk offered at the company’s shareholder meeting in September. There, Musk said full-year delivery growth would be between 30% to 40% over last year, implying a range of 477,750 to 514,500 cars. But the Street has homed in on that half-million figure, however, after Tesla said at the beginning of the year – but before the start of the pandemic – that deliveries should “comfortably exceed 500,000.”

Investors are also apt to focus on Musk’s discussions Wednesday around Tesla’s newly laid-out goals around manufacturing its own “tabless” batteries in-house, which are set to help reduce the company’s costs and improve the cars’ power and range.

These new batteries are expected to help the company eventually develop a $25,000 electric car, making the price to consumers much more appealing and competitive against the prices of existing combustion-engine vehicles. The new battery technology is not likely to reach mass production until 2022, however.

“Ramping manufacturing will determine success of the battery strategy,” Levy said. “Focus will sharpen on gross margin to see a path on cost improvements, and thus [opportunity] to expand volume via price cuts.”

100,2020-10-07T10:47:21+00:00,Netflix Wins Legal Battle to Screen ‘Bad Boy Billionaires’ Documentaries,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. won the right to stream a series featuring Indian tycoons who ran into trouble with the law, a victory that may boost its efforts to offer more local content in a crucial emerging market.

An Indian court allowed the American streaming giant to release a bulk of the episodes of its “Bad Boy Billionaires: India” -- a series that documents the travails of beer tycoon Vijay Mallya, diamantaire Nirav Modi and Subrata Roy, founder-owner of the realty-to-shadow financier group, Sahara India Pariwar. However, an episode on a software tycoon still faces challenge in another local court.

The win, after weeks of legal wrangling in Indian courts, bolsters Netflix, which is plowing hundreds of millions of dollars in India to offer more local content. The company is aiming for a larger slice of the biggest open market in Asia, with more than 500 million smartphones users.

The series “explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up -- and ultimately brought down -- India’s most infamous tycoons,” Netflix says on its website. The fourth episode of the series -- about B. Ramalinga Raju, -- remains on hold as Netflix is contesting a legal challenge on it. Raju confessed to inflating the assets of his software firm, Satyam Computer Services Ltd., by about $1 billion in 2009.

Netflix India declined to comment on the ongoing legal challenge and the recent legal win.

‘One-Sided’

Sahara India Pariwar, in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday, said the episode on Roy was “ill-motivated” and “contains various incorrect and misleading facts which depict only one-sided allegations.” The conglomerate, which got a stay order from court on the docuseries last month, has filed criminal cases against Netflix as well as its producers, directors and reporters, according to the statement.

Mallya, once called the “King of Good Times” for his extravagant lifestyle, is fighting his extradition to India. He was arrested in London in 2017 after 17 Indian banks accused him of willfully defaulting on more than 91 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in debt accumulated by Kingfisher Airlines -- a carrier he founded in 2005 and shut down seven years later.

Story continues

Nirav Modi, an ex-billionaire who used to be a jeweler to Hollywood stars -- Kate Winslet wore his creations to the Oscars -- is also fighting extradition to India where he’s accused of defrauding a stare-run lender of around $2 billion.

Falsifying Accounts

Roy was sent to custody in 2014 for his Sahara group’s failure to comply with an Indian markets regulator’s order for a $3.9 billion refund to depositors, forcing the tycoon to sell assets. He’s been out on parole since 2016. Sahara told the local court in its petition that the documentary demeaned Roy and his conglomerate and made baseless claims.

Raju was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2015 after an Indian court found him guilty of falsifying accounts at his firm, Satyam, by faking invoices, inflating cash reserves and understating debt. Raju told a Hyderabad court that airing the documentary would amount to defamation, while cases against him were still being heard in courts.

104,2020-09-23T00:20:39+00:00,A $50 Phone is Ambani's Weapon to Dominate India Telecom Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd. has asked local suppliers to ramp up production capacity in India so they can make as many as 200 million smartphones over the next two years, according to people familiar with the matter, a potentially enormous boost for the country’s technology ambitions and a warning shot to rivals such as Xiaomi Corp.

India’s most valuable company is in talks with domestic assemblers to make a version of its Jio phone that would run on Google’s Android and cost about 4,000 rupees ($54), said the people, asking not to be identified since the plans are private. The inexpensive phones will be marketed with low-cost wireless plans from Reliance Jio, the parent company’s carrier, they said.

Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani is aiming to remake the country’s smartphone industry much like he did in wireless services, where his aggressive prices and simple plans quickly made him the dominant force. The billionaire is also aligning himself with the Indian government’s plans to build more domestic manufacturing, a possible boost for local assemblers like Dixon Technologies India, Lava International and Karbonn Mobiles.

“We are of course trying to build our domestic companies. We have a sweet spot in entry level phones,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular & Electronic Association, during an interview on Bloomberg Television. “The world has realized that India is a great place to do business and a great place to do manufacturing also.”

In a sign that Ambani’s revving up his mobile campaign, Jio on Tuesday introduced a range of plans that, for as low as 399 rupees, offers not just data but also subscriptions to services from Netflix to Amazon Prime. Representatives for Reliance declined to comment on its production goals.

Reliance’s target of selling 150 million to 200 million phones over two years would represent a massive boost for local factories. India assembled an estimated 165 million smartphones in the year ended March, and about an equal number of basic feature phones, according to Mohindroo’s association. About a fifth of the smartphones cost less than 7,000 rupees, or about $100.

Story continues

Reliance rival Bharti Airtel is also in talks with assemblers to build its own 4G device, local media has reported. The Business Standard reported earlier that Ambani was considering outsourcing phone-making.

Reliance in July struck a broad alliance with Google, in which the Alphabet Inc. unit would invest $4.5 billion and cooperate on technology initiatives. The partnership is still under regulatory review so Reliance is proceeding with the mobile phone initiative on its own for now.

Ambani has drawn more than $20 billion in investments from U.S. giants like Facebook Inc. for Jio Platforms Pvt, whose subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is placing the order. It’s worked with assemblers on prototypes for at least two years in secret and can bring a phone rapidly to market, though it’s likely to miss the November Diwali shopping season, the people said.

If Reliance succeeds in popularizing the new gadget, it could lift the prospects for Jio Platforms, accelerating Ambani’s efforts to build an empire spanning e-commerce, social media and games. Many of Jio’s nearly 400 million users use no-frills second-generation devices, paying $2 monthly for voice and data -- a large potential market for the new device. It could eventually erode the market share of Chinese phonemakers such as Xiaomi.

“Jio has an opportunity to target more than half billion Indians who don’t own a smartphone and trigger a blue ocean market opportunity,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research. “With Reliance expected to work with Indian vendors, Chinese brands will lose out on a potential opportunity and market share.”

Reliance’s own requirements could hover around 5 million gadgets per month initially, but no single Indian company currently has that kind of capacity so the order will get split between multiple assemblers, the people said. At least two domestic smartphone makers are in discussions with the telecom giant, the people added.

Phones have become essential for accessing lite versions of apps from WhatsApp to YouTube in a country with an average GDP per capita of around $2,000. That’s why basic devices costing between $100 and $250 accounted for three-quarters of sales in the second quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint.

Reliance’s fourth-generation wireless gadgets -- one tier below 5G -- are aimed at the estimated 350 million users of basic or feature phones that now dominate India’s industry. Speaking at an industry event a few weeks ago, Ambani said millions were “trapped in the 2G era.”

“Their feature phones keep them excluded, even from the basic uses of internet at a time where both India and the rest of the world are standing at the doorsteps of 5G telephony,” he said.

The pandemic is spurring people to upgrade and creating new market opportunities. For example, parents are anxious to put a device in the hands of their kids so they can keep up with online lessons. There’re an estimated 250 million children between the ages of 6 and 16, according to UNICEF.

“If they’re successful in getting even 10% of this base to upgrade, Jio can become one of the leading smartphone brands of 2021,” Shah said.

106,2020-09-11T06:52:48+00:00,These Tiny Space Warriors Trump Tesla in Stock Market Race,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Thanks to Brexit and a dearth of racy, homegrown tech companies, the U.K. stock market has gone pretty much nowhere over the past five years. By comparison, an investor who bought an S&P 500 Index fund and reinvested dividends would have almost doubled their money.(2)

Happily, there’s a British company whose stock market performance has done miles better than that, outstripping even Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. Remarkably, the core of this business is unashamedly analogue, not digital.

I’m talking about Games Workshop Group Plc, the Nottingham-based manufacturer of tabletop, post-apocalyptic fantasy game Warhammer 40,000. Surprisingly high quarterly sales and profit, coupled with the promise of a chunky payout, lifted the shares by another 10% on Thursday, swelling the market capitalization to 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion). That’s more than U.K. high street clothing and food giant Marks & Spencer Group Plc.

The stock has gained almost 1,600% over the past five years and shareholders who reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 2,140% return, by far the best performance on the FTSE All-Share Index. In percentage terms only two Nasdaq 100 constituents — Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — have done better in the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Besides BlackRock Inc., Games Workshop’s largest shareholder is JP Morgan Chase & Co.’s asset management arm. Could it be that Jamie Dimon is a fan of miniature space marines and monsters?

For the uninitiated (I include myself in that description), Warhammer hobbyists purchase small plastic goblins and orcs and spend countless hours painting the miniatures and modeling fantastical landscapes. Battles are fought either at home or at one of the company’s retail outlets. The outcome is decided by rolling dice, along with the player’s tactics and strategic acumen, of course.

You might think this niche type of gaming would struggle in the era of elaborate and free-to-play mobile games such as Fortnite and Call of Duty. Social distancing rules have made it harder to meet up with groups of friends. But the in-person dynamic is clearly something Games Workshop is proud of. “Our games are played between people present in a room, not with a screen. They are truly social and build a real sense of community and comradeship,” the company states on its website. Collecting a mighty army doesn’t come cheap either — a potential problem during a recession.

Story continues

Yet business is booming, thanks to online sales and the company’s efforts to engage and connect players via social media and its website. Users of the Warhammer-community site increased by almost 40% to more than 8 million last year.

As with jigsaw puzzles, painting miniature space warriors is even more appealing when lockdowns mean there’s little to do in the “real world.” The company also publishes an extensive line of books. Of the 270 million pounds of total annual revenue, about three-quarters comes from overseas; North America is now the largest market. Teenagers aren’t the only target demographic — grown-ups are fanatical about the game too. It helps the hit Netflix TV series Stranger Things has given tabletop gaming a sprinkling of retro cool. Dungeons & Dragons, first created in the 1970s and now owned by Hasbro Inc., features prominently in the show.

Games Workshop stands out not just because of its unusual line of business for a high-flying stock, but also its conservative management style. Its financial statements are a model of clarity and devoid of flattering adjustments that feature all too prominently in many companies’ disclosures.

The company doesn’t have any debt and investments are funded entirely from its own cash flows. It’s all refreshingly old-school.

Thanks to a large cash buffer, Games Workshop didn’t face financial difficulties when its stores and factory were forced to close for several weeks in the spring. So it’s able to keep paying dividends. Sadly few U.K. retailers can say the same right now. (1)Operating profit margins are an astonishing 33%, or about the same as Facebook Inc. The retail outlets typically have just one enthusiast employee, which keeps costs down.

Of course, Games Workshop’s valuation is now well beyond what one might describe as restrained. The 42 times forward earnings multiple is a lot for a business that says it can’t know for sure what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be. Games Workshop already earns chunky royalties from licensing its intellectual property for use in video games and has talked about doing the same for television. Most of the latter type of projects remain at an early stage though.

Still, if someone tells you the high street has a dark future, remind them that selling table-top battle games is a path paved with gold, as well as gore.

(1) In local currency terms

(2) Games Workshop initially accepted furlough money but later decided to refund the government.

108,2020-09-09T20:40:12+00:00,‘There’s good value to be had’ for tech ETFs: Expert,"Yahoo Finance's Kristin Myers and Head of ETF and Mutual Fund Research at CFRA, Todd Rosenbluth, discuss the risk in investing in tech ETFs as the sector loses steam this week.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: --on research at CFRA. So Todd, I want to start off about the selloff that we saw, of course, led by tech. Now in the run up, a lot of people said, well, frankly some of these tech stocks are a little too expensive, so chose instead to get some exposure via tech ETFs. Now we're seeing we had this pullback, the rotation that we're seeing in the market. Are tech ETFs a little bit too risky to hold right now?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: No. We at CFRA still think there's good value to be had. We like technology ETFs. For example, XLK is it technology select sector spider. If you're going to buy tech ETFs, you really have to like Apple and Microsoft. Those are the two heavyweights, very concentrated portfolio.

We at CFRA have a bullish recommendation still on those companies, as well as companies like Visa that are also part of the portfolio. So we still think there's a good opportunity to be invested, but with the benefits of diversification using technology-- certain technology ETFs.

KRISTIN MYERS: So to that point, because I was reading your note, you don't see tech underperforming next year. And you're actually recommending that investors overweight the sector. I'm wondering what you're seeing coming up through to the end of 2020, but even ahead in 2021, any if there is at all a concern, perhaps, of a larger pullback coming in the next couple of months.

TODD ROSENBLUTH: Well, there's always going to be pullbacks that take place that give, perhaps, buying opportunities. We at CFRA have a few overweight recommended sectors, technology being one of them, communication services. Those are the more growth-oriented sectors that we like, and health care and consumer staples that are more defensive. So we do think you want to balance your portfolio out with both cyclical, risk-on, as well as more defensive, risk-off areas.

Story continues

Where we think there's still room to be had-- Apple has been performing very well, but has some news that's likely to be coming out that could drive the company forward. We think Microsoft has been a big beneficiary of the trend towards cloud. And again, those are the two heavyweight companies.

But there's also some good opportunities further-- slightly further down the market cap spectrum and with ETFs like XLK or VGT, which is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. You get that diversification. Or you can get a little bit more targeted with some more industry or thematic-oriented ETFs.

KRISTIN MYERS: Looking through your note, I was struck by the fact that energy ETFs most popular. And given the fact that energy has been lagging the broader market, what do you think has been behind that trend?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: So bottom fishing is likely what's happening. Investors have been looking to take the value opportunities and hope that there's going to be a recovery that's faster than expected. You're right XLE, which is the energy select sector spider, year-to-date through August had more inflows than technology-oriented ETFs.

The irony is that its asset base is largely flat where it was at the beginning of the year, despite having over $3 and 1/2 billion of net inflows. So 35%, give or take, of the assets grew because the portfolio was down more than 35%. So not a good investment. It has not worked out for many people.

But it's a sign that energy, as well as utilities, which was an area that's been underperforming-- investors are becoming more tactical this year, using sector-oriented ETFs. It's typically been a part of the ETF lineup. But it's increasingly been used as investors want to be focused on certain sectors, either growth or more value-oriented defensive sectors.

KRISTIN MYERS: So quickly, before I run out of time with you, Todd, I want to ask about actively-managed ETFs. They're growing in popularity. Do you think investors are better served with active management?

TODD ROSENBLUTH: Well, we're certainly seeing more of them. So we've had new entrants, like T. Rowe Price, enter the ETF market. We've got Fidelity and American Century. If you believe in active management, and there are many people who still think you can find value in outperforming the broader market, you get the tax efficiency benefits and liquidity that you're used to with ETFs. So really excited about what's happening. We've got some other players that are lined up to come to market, like JPMorgan, with active ETFs like this, as well as Invesco.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, thank you for joining us today.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The release of a Netflix series on four Indian tycoons facing fraud allegations has been put on hold following a state court order, two sources said on Thursday, in the latest legal tussle faced by the U.S. streaming giant in a key market.

The ""Bad Boy Billionaires: India"" documentary series about liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya, Subrata Roy of the Sahara group, founder and former head of Satyam Computer Services Ramalinga Raju and jeweller Nirav Modi was set for release this week.

The Araria district court in eastern Bihar state last week ordered a stay on its release after the Sahara group argued it would damage Roy's reputation, according to a copy of the order which is not public but was seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The court order said the series ""would certainly damage the reputation of the head of the Sahara family"".

Roy is currently on bail in a case where he has been ordered to repay billions of dollars to investors of a scheme run by Sahara which was found to be illegal.

Netflix had sought to appeal against the directive in the Supreme Court but was directed by judges on Wednesday to approach a higher state court first, the two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

""Netflix is currently deliberating what to do … the show's release is absolutely on hold,"" said one of the sources.

Netflix declined to comment.

The company counts India as a key growth market but its shows there have faced court cases and police complaints for obscenity or for hurting sentiments.

On Thursday, Netflix's website did not show a trailer or episodes of ""Bad Boy Billionaires"", but described it as an ""investigative docuseries (which) explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built up - and ultimately brought down - India's most infamous tycoons.""

Raju, who was accused of a $1 billion accounting fraud more than a decade ago, has also secured an order from another state's court against the show's release, the sources said.

Modi is facing extradition attempts by India after his arrest in London last year for alleged involvement in a $2 billion bank fraud, while Mallya too is in Britain fighting India's extradition bid for alleged fraud at his now defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

It was not clear if Modi or Mallya have filed petitions against the release of the series.

114,2020-08-31T22:00:07+00:00,You Think FAANG Is Distorting the S&amp;P? Consider ATM,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have lamented the lack of depth in the U.S. stock market, marveling at how a handful of big tech companies have grown to dominate almost a quarter of the S&P 500 and become responsible for all of this year’s gain. But that lopsidedness is nothing next to China, where the top three stocks in the benchmark MSCI China Index now have more than a 38% weight.

At this rate, instead of buying passive funds that track the MSCI index, investors might as well just pile into China’s version of FAANG, known locally as ATM: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and food delivery super-app Meituan Dianping.

There’s nagging unease that ATM’s economic prospects aren’t as sound as those of Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. In the U.S., deeply entrenched user behavior has protected tech companies from stepping on each other’s toes. Americans shop on Amazon, search on Google, and stream on Netflix.

In China, however, the competitive landscape is a lot murkier. Alibaba continues to face fierce competition from JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. Meanwhile, Jack Ma’s empire is still fighting with Tencent over mobile payments. As for Meituan Dianping, how many century stocks — companies with a market cap north of $100 billion — have rallied more than 160% so far this year? Meituan is eclipsed only by Tesla Inc. So it’s not unnatural to ask how much further ATM can go.

Passive fund flows, unleashed by the super dovish tone of the Federal Reserve, are propelling these three stocks even higher. That makes beating the benchmark MSCI China Index an impossible task. Value investing remains a losing game, because banks, the only segment big enough to tilt the index, are still struggling with bad loan writedowns.

To outperform the index and reduce reliance on ATM, then, investors have no choice but to hunt for smaller growth stocks. JD.com and Pinduoduo, for instance, are hedges against the Alibaba behemoth; both saw their market caps more than double this year. Electric vehicle startups XPeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have launched successful IPOs, as investors increasingly see the industry as recession-proof.

Story continues

Meanwhile, bullish equity analysts are telling tall tales to justify sky-high valuations. In mid-May, Zhongtai Securities Co. published a research report arguing that the baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai Co. is gold-like as an effective hedge against irresponsible central banks printing trillions of dollars of new money. Quantitative easing tends to benefit the rich, and has only created bubbles; as a scarce asset, Moutai is a good buy, the brokerage argued. The liquor maker hit a fresh high Monday, and is now valued at an eye-popping 48 times 2020 earnings.

While it’s understandable that the rich may want to celebrate their stock gains this year with a $300 bottle of Moutai, hot-pot chain operator Haidilao International Holding Ltd.’s meteoric rise is more puzzling. The Chinese are still apprehensive about dining out, recent macro retail data show, and Haidilao posted 965 million yuan ($139.5 million) in losses in the first half, versus 911 million yuan net profit in the same period last year.

But now Haidilao is seen as a robotics play. It opened its first smart, automated restaurant in Beijing almost two years ago. Once artificial intelligence is involved, profitability no longer matters.

There are plenty of other examples. Investors have crowded into expensive after-school education stocks as well as duty-free goods operators, all as attempts to diversify from ATM. When we’re in a bull market, pigs can fly.

For months, we’ve been worried that a top-heavy stock market would be vulnerable to a crash. One generous line of thinking has been that value stocks will perk up once economies recover, and indexes will look more balanced. That may well be the case, but until that day comes — and it could take years — the ATMs and FAANGs of the world have already distorted stock investing into an unrecognizable form.

116,2020-08-25T22:00:11+00:00,FANGMAN Is No Match for These 'Seven Princesses',"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many have marveled at how the U.S. stock market has become dominated by Big Tech. Just a handful of companies — captured by acronyms such as FANG, FAANG and even FANGMAN — have emerged as winners in the Covid-19 world.

This is by no means a phenomenon unique to the U.S. In South Korea, investors have crowded into what’s known locally as the seven princesses: two biotechs, two electric-vehicle battery makers and three internet companies. On average, they have rallied about 90% this year, outperforming FAANG stocks (Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent, Alphabet Inc.). Together, the princesses account for more than 18% of the Kospi Index, promising to overtake the ultimate blue chip, Samsung Electronics Co. as the dominant market mover.

South Korean equities have weathered a seismic shift this year. Retail investors, who dabbled in cryptocurrencies and all sorts of exotic structured products in the past, are now buying domestic stocks. They single-handedly supported the main stock index as foreigners fled.

But unlike investors from abroad, who see the Kospi as a mere cyclical semiconductor play, locals are hunting for the next Samsung, one that will thrive in a society rewritten by trade wars and Covid-19. In their view, the smartphone supply chain is yesterday’s story. U.S. President Donald Trump was unraveling it well before the coronavirus outbreak.

Instead, the Koreans are beaming with national pride at the sophistication of their advanced medical supplies and technology, and the country’s success in controlling the pandemic. Two of the princesses, Samsung Biologics Co. and Celltrion Inc., play right into that sentiment.

Just as its sibling Samsung Electronics makes memory chips for Apple’s iPhone, Samsung Biologics seeks to leverage the conglomerate’s manufacturing prowess to make drugs and vaccines for Big Pharma. Earlier this month, the company laid out an ambitious plan to build a fourth plant, its largest by far, boosting its total capacity 71% and turning it into the world’s largest biopharmaceutical manufacturer. Meanwhile, Celltrion is introducing two coronavirus testing kits in the U.S.; last month, its Covid-19 antibody drug entered phase one clinical trials.

Story continues

EV battery manufacturing is another sector many Koreans see as Covid-proof (just look at Tesla Inc.’s stock). It’s also an area where the country already has an edge, given Samsung SDI Co. and LG Chem Ltd. are global leaders. The battery makers can see rising demand ahead. China has extended its EV subsidies until 2022 to support the industry, while the European Union has earmarked 30% of its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion), seven-year budget for climate-related spending.

And don’t forget, Korea has state-of-the-art internet infrastructure, which enables e-commerce and video gaming when people are stuck at home. Unlike traditional retail sales, Korea’s lockdown didn’t even make a dent in e-commerce. Online shopping has bigger penetration than in the U.S., accounting for about 30% of the total retail value versus 20%. This benefits Naver Corp., Kakao Corp. and video-game developer NCSoft Corp., the three internet princesses.

On a traditional price-to-earnings basis, none of the seven princesses is coming cheap. But what’s valuation in the world of easy money? As the Bank of Korea pushes its benchmark rate to near zero, future earnings — as far as a decade down the road — don’t need to be discounted.

You could even go a step further and argue the princesses are a more diversified bunch than FANGMAN, which all orbit around smartphones. The Koreans know better than to pin their hopes on one prince charming.

Partner said on Tuesday it earned 7 million shekels ($2.06 million) in the first quarter, up from 3 million a year earlier. Revenue dropped 1% to 774 million shekels, hurt by restrictions on international travel that lowered roaming services and reduced activity in shopping malls.

""The strengthening of the fixed-line segment and our status as a communications group contributed to our ability to remain stable during this period,"" said CEO Isaac Benbenisti.

Partner said it cut costs by putting ""a significant number of employees on unpaid leave"" and found alternative channels for equipment sales.

Still, ""continuation in the international travel cessation will result in a material negative impact on the company's results of operations for the second half of 2020,"" CFO Tamir Amar said.

The company's cellular subscriber base climbed to 2.708 million in the quarter from 2.676 in the previous quarter.

The number of subscribers to Partner's Internet-based TV service grew to 215,000 during the quarter, while its fibre optics network now reaches 657,000 households.

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Britons spent 40% of their waking day watching TV and online video at the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in April, including spending twice as long watching streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video, regulator Ofcom said.

Adults, who were advised by the government in late March to stay at home, spent on average six hours and 25 minutes a day watching news and entertainment, Ofcom said, a rise of almost a third on the same month a year ago.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on May 10 that lockdown measures would be eased was the most watched programme of the year so far, with 18.7 million viewers, while the imposition of lockdown on March 23 was second with 14.6 million.

Queen Elizabeth's broadcast to the nation was third with 14 million.

When they were not watching news and information about the pandemic, Britons increasingly turned to video streaming services for entertainment.

An estimated 12 million adults signed up to a new streaming service in the first weeks of lockdown, of whom 3 million had never subscribed to one before, Ofcom said.

Disney+, which was launched by the U.S. entertainment group in Britain on the first day of lockdown, made an immediate impact, attracting 16% of online adults by early July to become the third-ranked service behind Netflix, which had 45%, and Amazon Prime Video, with 39%.

Traditional broadcasters, led by the publicly funded BBC and its commercial rival ITV, briefly achieved their highest combined share of broadcast TV viewing in more than six years in March.

But the boost proved short lived and their share dropped back by June as the pandemic interrupted the production of soap operas, major sporting events and entertainment shows, Ofcom said.

121,2020-07-15T22:00:00+00:00,REFILE-FOCUS-Rupert Murdoch's big investment headache: Australia,"(Refiles to add dropped word ""up"" in first para)

By Byron Kaye

SYDNEY, July 16 (Reuters) - The birthplace of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp's Australian business, is shaping up as a trouble spot for the global firm, following a billion dollar writedown and a move to stop printing more than 100 regional newspapers.

It's an emotional challenge, given 89-year-old Murdoch's ties to his native country where he turned a single newspaper inherited from his father in 1952 into one of the world's most influential companies.

The Australian arm faces a double incursion: the broadcast business, Foxtel, is fast losing subscribers to streaming giants like Netflix Inc, while the print arm, like its rivals, is ceding advertisers to Facebook and Google.

""You couldn't engineer more pressure, I don't think, than what Foxtel is under at the moment,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the company's Australian strategy, speaking on condition of anonymity.

""The business should have moved much more aggressively into the streaming space than it did.""

The Australian arm was the only part of News Corp left unchanged when the company spun off its broadcast business in 2013, keeping publishing assets like The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins and a string of British newspapers.

Along with more than 100 newspapers controlling two-thirds of the Australian market, the unit included a stake in real estate website REA Group Ltd and struggling pay-TV group Foxtel.

Now, it is proving to be the biggest single drag on earnings for News Corp globally.

In a statement to Reuters, News Corp Co-Chairman and Rupert's son Lachlan Murdoch reinforced the company's commitment to its Australian operations.

""No media company is in a stronger position to face the uncertainties of the digital age than News Corp. We have incredible strength in print with publications such as The Wall Street Journal, the Sunday Times, The Australian and our dailies in Australia,"" he said.

Story continues

""Our company began in Australia and Australia remains a critical part of our future.""

FOXTEL WOES

Started in 1995 as a joint venture with local telecom Telstra Corp Ltd, Foxtel, which used satellite dishes and television ""set-top boxes"", once seemed primed for home viewing dominance against a handful of free-to-air TV channels.

Then Netflix arrived, and Foxtel's subscriber numbers swooned. At end-March 2020, Foxtel had 2.9 million subscribers, barely changed from 2016, while Netflix has at least double that number, according to figures supplied by Foxtel and Roy Morgan market researchers.

In the March quarter, Foxtel's earnings fell 31% from a year earlier, while News Corp took a $931 million impairment charge on the value of the pay-TV service, pushing News Corp to a $1 billion loss.

Earnings have been hurt by subscribers taking up cheaper - and lower revenue - online offers from Foxtel itself, while it now faces a pandemic-related shutdown of sports, its main competitive difference.

News Corp owns 65% of Foxtel - paying about A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2012 for an extra 25% stake, implying a total value of around A$8 billion - while Telstra holds 35%. In May, Telstra valued its stake at just A$450 million, implying that all of Foxtel is now worth around A$1.3 billion.

JPMorgan analysts put the value at A$1.1 billion including debt, which stood at roughly A$1.7 billion in 2019, based on figures in News Corp's annual report.

""I've had a view it's worth nothing for a long time,"" said Rhett Kessler, a principal at Pengana Australian Equities, a top-20 shareholder of Telstra.

Telstra declined to comment.

News Corp declined comment beyond Murdoch's statement. It has said a new streaming service, Binge, will capitalise on Australians' appetite for content during prolonged periods at home due to the coronavirus response.

ACCELERATING CHANGE

Globally, News Corp is benefiting from a campaign to build digital subscribers and cut reliance on advertising, led by subscription surges for high-end titles like Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal.

In May, the Australian arm said it would stop printing 112 regional newspapers. While many will be published online, some 36 titles were shuttered altogether.

Analysts said the move was a step in the right direction, with bigger national titles like broadsheet The Australian more likely to be able to win digital subscriptions.

Still, short-sellers - investors who profit when stocks fall - are targetting the stock. Since March, News Corp's Australian-listed CDIs, which offer indirect share ownership, have been the most shorted instrument in Australia most days, industry figures show.

Its $7 billion market value is less than that of its assets combined. Its 61% stake in listed real estate website REA Group Ltd is worth about $6 billion, while The Wall Street Journal, if valued on the same multiples as rival The New York Times Co, is worth about $4 billion, Australian shareholder L1 Capital noted recently.

Accelerating change in Australia may fall to Lachlan, 48, when Murdoch senior cedes control, analysts and people with knowledge of the company say, with the company taking a more commercially focused approach.

Foxtel will replace its set-top box model with streaming inside a decade, they say, although this will generate a fraction of current revenues per customer and the company will be competing in a crowded market.

Still, Lachlan shares his father's belief that news is central to the business model and is unlikely to shut the main newspapers, keeping the Australian unit as part of News Corp's sprawling global business.

""His responsibility now is to transform the business from a traditional media business that could be going the way of the dinosaur to something that will be survivable for the next few decades,"" said JPMorgan analyst Eric Pan.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: --Sachs, as I had mentioned, out with a good earnings report today. They actually had beat on the both top and bottom lines. That stock right now up just over 1%, so paring some of the gains they had a little bit earlier today.

When you're looking at today, right now, energy, industrials, and financials are all leading today. Tech starting to flip into the green right now. Microsoft still in the red. However, Apple and Facebook-- Facebook a little bit flat right now, but Apple now in the green, up about 3/10 of a percentage point.

And on the coronavirus front, as I just mentioned, Moderna coming out some positive news when it comes to that vaccine. But they're not the only ones. AstraZeneca also announcing that they would be having some good news to share with us on the vaccine front as early potentially as tomorrow. That would be Thursday.

Current case count right now nearing 3.5 million, which means we leapfrogged past that 3.4 million number. If you guys remember yesterday, it was just under 3.4 million. Now steadily approaching that 3.5 million number. New York state, sad news here, has now surpassed 25,000 deaths due to COVID-19. And in Oklahoma, Governor Kevin Stitt says that he has actually tested positive for coronavirus.

Now, as I mentioned, markets had been popping a little bit more earlier today on that positive vaccine news out from Moderna and AstraZeneca. Goldman Sachs, also as I mentioned, out with some positive earnings. So for more on what we're seeing in the markets today, we're joined now by Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab. Thanks for joining us, Jeff.

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Thanks for having me on.

KRISTIN MYERS: So in a recent blog that I had been reading, you had written, quote, in these uncertain times, it may be comforting to know that the markets are making some sense. So where are markets making sense in your mind? And where does the confusion still remain?

Story continues

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, you know, one of the things that's important is the biggest driver for stocks over the long term are earnings. But even in the near term, stocks and the direction of earnings estimates should be lining up. And although we are seeing a bit of an uptick here in the last month or so in earnings estimates, the actual level, the number, it's a guess at this point.

But the fact that we're seeing more analysts raise the-- raise their numbers for companies then cut them is important. And that's something the stock market has been tracking really all year. As analysts were cutting estimates, stocks were falling. And now as we're seeing a larger and larger number of companies seeing upward estimates, stocks have been tracking that.

And that's really important. As we go through the earnings season here, I think we're going to see more of this. You're going to hear more of these results, exceeding expectations. About 80% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far-- I know it's early-- but they have exceeded expectations.

And what we've seen in recent business surveys around the world-- Australia, France, Germany, the US-- is an uptick in business leader confidence. And that may translate into better guidance and the continuation of this trend of upward earnings estimates. So that's a positive for the markets.

Where I'm seeing a disconnect, just to jump to that, is in the expectations for dividends. The financial sector is a great example. We got some results this morning. We'll get more this week.

Analysts are more optimistic on the return of dividends later this year, both for US and international financial services companies. Not true in the markets. If we look at dividend futures, markets are still expecting those dividends to basically remain at the levels they are now post-COVID all through next year.

So there's a potential there for an upward revision to dividend expectations, which could provide further upside to the financial sector, one of the areas leading today.

KRISTIN MYERS: So Jeffrey, I want to ask you about that guidance point, especially as we're looking out a little bit further into Q3, Q4, and even into 2021. As you're mentioning, analysts really downbeat on this quarter when it comes to earnings. Do you see a revision in the future, more optimism there, raising the bar that some of these companies are going to have to beat in future earning-- future earnings reports for coming quarters?

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Yeah, it's true that the bar may go up a little bit here. And companies-- yeah, it's a little bit harder. But look, the market's hardly raised that bar. We've seen such a rebound in the stock market. We need to see that follow through in terms of earnings expectations to support these valuations.

Yeah, down the road, third quarter, fourth quarter, companies are going to come up on those hurdles that may be a bit higher. And they're going to have to clear them. And so that could be a challenge down the road and lead to more of-- maybe more volatility in the markets later this year.

But for now, to support this upside move, we continue to see these upward revisions. So in the near term, that's good news. It does create a higher hurdle down the road.

KRISTIN MYERS: So on the vaccine front, as I had been mentioning, we got some positive news out from Moderna, AstraZeneca. We've heard a lot of positive news from Gilead, BioNTech, Regeneron. The list kind of seems to be going on.

And I feel like we're in this environment that we were in before when it came to the US-China trade deal. It almost feels as if we are in this binary moment, a will they, won't they when it comes to the vaccine. So, I mean, how do investors manage on just trading on whether we are going to get a vaccine or we are not going to be getting a vaccine?

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Right, there will certainly be a big difference. A vaccine is an important accelerator of economic activity. So it's understandable the market's reacting in such a bifurcated way, I mean, especially where the number of cases continue to climb, like in the US and in Brazil and in India.

It would also be a welcome relief for lagging industries, like the airlines and hotels and restaurants. We're still seeing pretty soft things like weekend box office revenue. Even though movie theaters are now open in much of Europe and Asia, even where the virus has been defeated, like Japan or Korea or France, people aren't really returning to movie theaters or flying on airplanes, for example. So a vaccine could see a sharper service sector recovery and really lift the stocks in some of those areas.

But the good news is a recovery is still underway, even without a vaccine. And this is what investors should focus on. Business surveys, as I mentioned, in the past week in France, in Germany, Australia, other places, do reflect the V-shaped recovery in at least business leader confidence. And that's important as we look to the future for the labor market, which is so critical to our consumer-driven economy.

KRISTIN MYERS: So I want to ask you about tech right now. As I mentioned, tech wasn't doing so well today, although we have now seen some bigger FAANG stocks flipping into the green. Now anyone that read the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief-- I want to give a shout out there to Myles Udland and Sam Ro-- they were talking about investor worries about betting big on tech.

So I'm wondering, Jeffrey, in your mind, how much risk is there in the high weighting of tech stocks right now? And in the brief, I kind of want to quote here that they noted a net 42% of investors are overweight technology stocks, the highest of any sector.

JEFFREY KLEINTOP: It's easy to let your portfolio drift into that position. I do think that's a risk. We are not overweight the technology sector. We were for many, many, many years. And we have taken that down.

We're now overweight financials. Here's an area where probably most investors are underweight in their portfolio. After many years of disappointing performance, we think there's a rotation taking place from growth to value. And we're seeing this show up even in day like today, where again, financials are outperforming the tech sector and they have for the last couple of months.

This is not just a theme in the near term. We think it will unfold through this entire economic cycle. So it's important for investors to get ahead of this and rebalance their portfolios back to a more balanced representation across growth sectors, like tech, and value ones, like financials.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, we'll have to leave that there.

Caterpillar gives Dow a late surge

Shares of the Deerfield, Illinois-based heavy equipment manufacturer closed at $136.88, up 4.83% from Monday's close of $130.57. The stock helped the Dow post a 556.79-point gain, a 2.13% increase from the previous close of 26,085.80. becfb54f20c2c492f5aebdd2c8938d55.png

On the other hand, FAANG stocks like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) finished in the red: The Nasdaq Composite Index increased just 0.94% following a 2% decline on Monday. 19df0e9b5a29e5ef51b465b56409b996.png

According to CNBC, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said that the third quarter could see a mean-reversion in cyclical sectors, sectors that could have been oversold during the coronavirus pandemic.

Investor sentiment increased on the back of Florida and California, two states that have seen surging coronavirus cases over the past week, report new cases slightly lower than the seven-day average.

As such, investors might find opportunities in farm and machinery companies with strong balance sheets and are thus capable of weathering the virus outbreak.

Caterpillar gives Dow a late surge

Shares of the Deerfield, Illinois-based heavy equipment manufacturer closed at $136.88, up 4.83% from Monday's close of $130.57. The stock helped the Dow post a 556.79-point gain, a 2.13% increase from the previous close of 26,085.80. becfb54f20c2c492f5aebdd2c8938d55.png

According to CNBC, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said that the third quarter could see a mean-reversion in cyclical sectors, sectors that could have been oversold during the coronavirus pandemic.

Investor sentiment increased on the back of Florida and California, two states that have seen surging coronavirus cases over the past week, report new cases slightly lower than the seven-day average.

As such, investors might find opportunities in farm and machinery companies with strong balance sheets and are thus capable of weathering the virus outbreak.

Telkom said the decision came after a ""change in the U.S. company's approach to the country"". This includes Netflix offering parental controls as well as agreeing to examine complaints from Indonesia's government or regulators over content within 24 hours.

After Netflix launched in January 2016 in Indonesia, it ran afoul of the Indonesia's film censorship board in 2016 for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual. It was subsequently blocked by Telkom, who said it would continue blocking the service until it adhered the country's regulations.

The world's largest Muslim-majority country, with a youthful population of 270 million, is experiencing a boom in its digital economy, which is seen reaching $130 billion by 2025, according to a study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company.

State-owned Telkom, which operates a mobile carrier with 170 million mobile subscribers as well as a home internet company, is aiming to increase the availability of content providers to its users.

Netflix business development manager Tizar Patria Irsyadi said in a statement that they were ""delighted that Netflix is now accessible through Telkom.""

""We look forward to continually improving our service for all Indonesians as we introduce more local shows on our service,"" he noted.

The announcement comes the same day that Netflix was named as among several foreign internet firms that would be required to pay a 10% value-added tax in the country, which a spokesman for the U.S. company said it would comply with.

Telkom's vice president for corporate communications, Arif Prabowo, said he hoped that Netflix would advance the country's entertainment industry by increasing the number of local productions.

Prabowo separately told Reuters that as part of its digital push Telkom had held discussions with Disney's Disney+ platform, but that no agreement had yet been reached.

Disney+ is currently in the middle of a hiring spree in the region and is expected to launch in Southeast Asia as early as 2021.

128,2020-07-02T17:42:04+00:00,Nifty FAANG and Other 'One Decision' Investment Strategies,"If in early January, you'd have described to us everything that was to happen with the world and global economy and then asked us to guess where the stock market would be, we would not have guessed it would be at today's level.

Looking at the stock market today, the first thought that comes to mind is that it is divorced from economic reality. The S&P 500 is only a few percent away from where it started 2020.

SPY 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of SPY Peter Lynch Chart of SPY

On the surface it looks like stocks discount one incredibly rosy version of the future. In that version everything goes back to normal like nothing happened; we basically just entered and quickly exited a sharp recession and earnings came back to pre-coronavirus normal. Though that is a possible outcome, it is not a probable one, judging by what is happening right now. We'd like to note that, in any scenario, we'll exit with close to $10 trillion of additional debt on the government's and the Fed's balance sheets

I used the word discount. To discount something you bring future earnings (cash flows) at a discount rate to today's dollars. The Federal Reserve bought trillions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds of suspect quality through ETFs, taking interest rates to almost zero. This act has pushed the discount rate lower and wound up the spring of the music box in the Fed's game of musical chairs. So the market behavior to a large degree reflects not the sum of future scenarios but the much lower discount rate by which these scenarios are discounted.

Since the Fed is buying, the music is playing, and investors keep dancing (speculating). Greed is back. It seems that this music just keeps on playing.

But will it?

The economy is a very complex organic system created by trillions of individual transactions. The Fed's involvement introduces inorganic matter into the ecosystem that slowly poisons and atrophies the system. The Fed's active involvement distorts price signaling (higher prices lead to higher demand and vice versa) as it manipulates the price of the most fundamental commodity in the system - interest rates (the price of money).

Story continues

The Fed's buying junk bonds through ETFs has brought us closer to a Walking Dead economy. It has given a further lease on life to mostly dead companies that otherwise would have perished. But it's easy for me to sit here and criticize. If I ran the Fed in March 2020, I probably would have done the same thing - the possible cost of doing nothing would have been a global depression. The bottom line is that the Fed temporarily stimulated a humongous amount of greed in a system that was shaking in fear.

We are not investing in the economy we'd like to have, but in the one we have. However, this dance cannot go on forever or at some point the Fed will own all financial assets and the U.S. economy will turn into a Potemkin village. This is why, though it has been unfashionable and even counterproductive lately, we'll keep sticking to buying great, undervalued companies, not just great companies irrespective of price.

Nifty FANGAM

While you are pondering on this, here is another observation.

If you look deeper under the hood of the stock market, you'll see that there is a significant dichotomy between bytes stocks and atoms stocks. The atoms are losing to the bytes, badly. If you compare performance of the S&P 500 (SPY) traditional market-capitalization index - the one you see in the news - to its less-known cousin, the S&P 500 equal-weighted (RSP), you'll see a significant disparity in performance.

In the market cap-weighted version, the top five stocks (all five are members of FANGAM gang - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) now represent 21% of the capitalization of the index (the last time this happened was 1999) and thus account for 21% of the returns. In RSP these stocks have a weight of 1% (they're just 5 out of 500 stocks).

SPY is down 6% for the year, where RSP is down 16% - remember, same stocks, it's just that SPY is heavily weighted toward bytes stocks, as they have larger market caps, and RSP treats bytes and atoms equally. The virus has been much kinder to bytes than atoms stocks; it has benefitted those companies as our world has become a bit more virtual and atoms were impacted by social distancing. The problem is, bytes were very expensive going into the coronavirus crisis, and they just got even more pricey (unless their businesses have improved to a greater degree than their stocks prices appreciated, which is possible but unlikely, with the possible exception of Amazon).

Just as any propaganda needs a certain germ of truth to grow from, so do bubbles. The FANGAM are incredible companies (germ of truth), and they function better in the virus-infested world (another germ of truth). But at the core, their existence is grounded in the world that is built of atoms, not bytes.

For instance, Google's advertising business will continue to take market share from non-digital forms of advertisement (not sure if any are left), but atom-based companies are the largest source of Google's advertising revenue. If the atom world is not doing well, neither will Google. Also, the law of large numbers usually kicks in at some point: A company cannot grow at supernormal rates forever or it will become bigger than the market it is serving.

The Nifty Fifty stocks come to mind here. Those were the fifty stocks - the who's who of the 1960s -that made America great (then): Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG) ... the list goes on. Though today we look at some of them as has-beens, in the '60s and '70s the world was their oyster. Coke and McDonald's were spring chickens then, spreading the American health values of diabetes and cholesterol (okay, maybe I'm being too hard on them) across this awesome planet.

Although it was hard to imagine in the '70s that any of these companies would not shine forever, they are a useful reminder that even great companies get disrupted. Avon (AVP), Kodak (KODK), Polaroid, GE (GE), Xerox (XRX) -all were Nifty Fifties, and all either went bankrupt or are heading towards irrelevancy.

In the 1960s and early 1970s these stocks were one-rule stock - and the rule was, buy! They were bought, and bought, and bought. They were great companies and paying attention to how much you paid for them was irrelevant.

Until.

The Nifty FANGAM is arguably not as expensive as the Nifty Fifty was in 1972. Lawrence Hamtil put this nice table together, using data gathered by The Brooklyn Investor blog, which divides the Nifty Fifty stocks into two groups. The cheap basket traded at around 28 times earnings and the expensive basket at about 60 or so. Neither the cheap nor the expensive basket did well in the decade of the '70s. Today, FANGAM stocks in general trade closer to the cheap basket's valuation.

If you bought and held Coke or McDonald's in 1972 (or any other Nifty Fifty stock), then you experienced a painful decade of no returns; in fact, at times you were down 50% or more. Coca Cola was as great a company in 1974 as it was in 1972, but the stock was down 50% from its high. Okay, Coca Cola was trading at 47 times earnings in 1972. But even a company like Procter & Gamble that was trading at ""only"" 32 times earnings in 1972 was down almost 50% in 1974 from its 1972 high. It took until the early 80s - a decade - until investors who bought Nifty Fifties at the top broke even - and this applies to almost all of them.

Nifty Fifty (1970's)

In today's far less patient world, that decade might as well be infinity.

As I am writing this I am struggling with a few issues. First, interest rates and inflation were much higher in the '70s and early '80s. Now, interest rates are at zero, going to negative or to ... no idea what level. Globalization was deflationary, thus de-globalization will likely be inflationary; but automation may dampen the inflationary impact, at least some of it. If we get negative rates, then on one hand they should boost stocks' price-to-earnings ratio. (Paradoxically, the further a company's cash flow is in the future, the more it is worth in today's dollars. Yes, makes little sense to us, either). On the other hand, if we have negative rates, that means we are desperate and thus earnings are collapsing.

In an inflationary environment, most earnings growth will be eaten away by declining price-to-earnings, as it happened in the '70s.

Another issue: If you held many Nifty Fifties for 20 years, from 1972 to 1992, they would have delivered a decent (10%-plus) return. This sounds great in theory; however, most people would have run out of patience after a decade of no or negative returns and thus not have been around for the fruits of the '80s decade. In other words, shareholders who bought the stocks in 1970 were not the ones who benefitted from the returns in the late '80s.

Today the Nifty FANGAM has turned into one-rule stocks - buy! (irrespective of price). If you did not own them over the last decade, your portfolio had an enormous headwind against it.

But what the Nifty Fifties showed us is that company greatness and past growth are not enough. Starting valuation - what you actually pay for the business -matters. The great companies will still be great when their stocks are down a bunch and they have a decade of no returns. Dividends aside, stock returns in the long run are not just driven by earnings growth but by what the price-to-earnings does as well. If price-to-earnings is high, it's mean reverts - declines - chipping away at the return you receive from earnings growth. I (this is Vitaliy) wrote two books on this topic.

The '70s were almost fifty years ago. Fine, just look up Microsoft, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Coca Cola, and Wal-Mart (WMT) stock charts from the late '90s, and you'll see that history repeats itself, again and again (see charts below).

What you pay for even a great company matters. Paraphrasing the great Freddie Mercury, there must be more to the stock market than FANGAM (though that has not been the case lately). They were the tailwind for the S&P 500, but they'll likely turn into a headwind over the next decade, and become an anchor around its neck.

Nifty Nineties (1990's)

I am not a journalist or reporter; I am an investor who thinks through writing. This and other investment articles are just my thinking at the point they were written. However, investment research is not static, it is fluid. New information comes our way and we continue to do research, which may lead us to tweak and modify assumptions and thus to change our minds.

We are long-term investors and often hold stocks for years, but as luck may or may not have it, by the time you read this article we may have already sold the stock. I may or may not write about this company ever again. Think of this and other articles as learning and thinking frameworks. But they are not investment recommendations. The bottom line is this. If this article piques your interest in the company I've mentioned, great. This should be the beginning, not the end, of your research.

MUMBAI, June 29 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's streaming service Disney+ Hotstar plans to premiere seven big ticket Bollywood films originally meant for theatrical release this year, as it seeks to expand its lead in subscribers over rivals Netflix and Amazon's Prime Video.

Monday's announcement follows similar moves in India by Netflix and Prime and deals a fresh blow to movie theatre operators like PVR and Inox Leisure, which have seen a raft of likely box office hits opt for digital releases due to theatre shutdowns in the COVID-19 pandemic.

""This is something that we've been thinking of for a long time. The pandemic provided this opportunity because a number of films that are ready or about to be ready don't have any clarity on when they can be released,"" said Uday Shankar, who heads Disney's operations in India.

India has eased restrictions around its more than two-month long nationwide lockdown, but malls, multiplexes and theatres largely remain shut.

Streaming platforms like Amazon and Netflix have in the past signed deals with Indian studios for digital rights, but mainstream releases have prioritised theatrical revenues in the past.

Shankar said direct-to-digital releases were always on the horizon, due to a lack movie screens and limited release windows in India, but the lockdown had accelerated the idea of releasing films digitally.

Hotstar reported 300 million monthly active users last year. Most use the free, advertising-supported service, but Disney has said it aims to convert many of these users into paying subscribers.

Disney acquired Hotstar via its $71 billion purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox's film and television assets in 2019. It rebranded the service as Disney+ Hotstar in April.

Hotstar said the first release, a Bollywood remake of the Hollywood hit ""The Fault in Our Stars"", will be released on July 24 this year.

130,2020-06-26T16:07:22+00:00,Best ETFs for 2020: The Communication Services SPDR ETF Is on the Mend,"This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com’s Best ETFs for 2020 contest. Todd Shriber’s pick for the contest is the Communication Services SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLC). Best ETFs for 2020: Communication Services SPDR ETF Is on the Mend

The Communication Services SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLC) probably won’t catch some of the leading contenders, such as cloud computing and innovative technology funds, in the 2020 edition of the Best ETFs Contest, but give XLC some credit, as it has recaptured nearly all of its March losses. In fact, as of June 25, it resides just 5.51% below its record high.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

A second-quarter gain of almost 30% fueled in large part by internet behemoths Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is helping the exchange-traded fund climb out of the hole caused by the novel coronavirus earlier in the year. XLC allocates more than 45% of its weight to those three securities, so saying they’re important to XLC’s fortunes is an understatement.

Facebook retured almost 50% in the April through June period, which was a boon for XLC. This is particularly important because the social media giant is once again the center of political controversy. Politicians aren’t just concerned about the monopoly-esque status enjoyed by Facebook (Alphabet is part of this conversation, too), but also the company’s perceived political leanings.

Alphabet and Facebook traversed political waters before and with polls suggesting the occupying party of the White House and Senate majority will flip come November, analysts aren’t shying away from upgrading the two internet giants.

Covid-19 Concerns

The recent resurgence in coronavirus cases can affect XLC in either direction. Getting the fund’s vulnerabilities out of the way first, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is a top 10 XLC holding, accounting for 4.32% of the ETF’s weight.

10 Consumer Stocks to Buy to Ride the Post-Covid-19 Wave

Disney is modestly higher over the past week, but there’s headline risk here, including the delayed reopening of Disneyland in California. Florida, home to Disney World, is also experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases. The Sunshine State is loathe to implement another shutdown, but Disney can do that on its own and it would likely hamper to stock. None of that includes potential delays to the restarts of the NBA and NHL seasons or the possibility that either college football and the NFL won’t start on time this year — all scenarios that would weight on Disney’s ESPN unit.

Story continues

In better news, XLC is also uniquely positioned to withstand another shutdown and not simply because folks will be killing time Googling stuff or posting on Facebook. In lieu of a proper streaming entertainment ETF, XLC is an adequate proxy with robust exposure to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), among other streaming stocks. Put simply, Netflix is one of the best-performing S&P 500 stocks this year and shelter-in-place directives are a big reason why that’s the case.

Likewise, video game stocks are on a roll this year, ranking as the other segment — in addition to streaming — that’s benefiting from stay-at-home policies. Even if another shutdown doesn’t come to pass, XLC’s video game exposure is meaningful because it’s derived via game publishers. With a console upgrade cycle coming later this year, gamers will want new software to test out the new hardware and that could be catalyst for several XLC components like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision-Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).

The Bottom Line on XLC as One of the Best ETFs

As noted above, XLC is behind some of the other competitors in the Best ETFs fray, but that’s not a reason to dump or ignore the fund.

Alphabet and Facebook sport pristine balance sheets, sit on mounds of cash and are proving largely immune to political pressure. Additionally, the fund’s exposure to the disruption offered by the gaming and streaming industries is compelling for long-term investors that don’t want to stock pick in those arenas.

That is to say, with few exceptions, XLC’s holdings are mostly growth stocks and growth is on a multi-year run of crushing value.

The Comcast unit announced the move after a two-month lockdown to curb a coronavirus outbreak when Italy's data traffic using fixed lines almost doubled as people worked and studied from home, and spent their free time streaming videos.

""We're interested in becoming the main player in people's living rooms and the rest of their homes,"" the head of SKY's Italian operations Maximo Ibarra said in a presentation, adding that the plans did not include offering mobile services.

Italy has one of the lowest fiber-to-the-home usage in Europe. Demand for ultrafast home connections is expected to rise in the coming months, as many people are expected to continue working from home.

""We have been forced home, putting the Italian telecoms infrastructure under great stress,"" said Ibarra, a former top executive at Dutch telecoms operator KPN.

SKY has invested 230 million euros ($261 million) to launch its broadband service in Italy, he said.

SKY will provide the service using the fiber-optic infrastructure of wholesale broadband firm Open Fiber, jointly owned by Italian utility Enel and state lender CDP.

SKY's service will start in 26 cities this month and will extend to 120 during the summer.

Ibarra said it would be extended further as Open Fiber's coverage expanded. In the meantime, SKY has signed a deal with Swisscom's Fastweb to reach clients in areas not currently covered by Open Fiber.

SKY's entrance in the broadband business will add pressure on former state phone monopoly Telecom Italia, which has steadily lost market share in the fixed-line segment.

The content services offered by SKY, which has 5.2 million customers, are facing increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

* Deals position MultiChoice for future

* Streaming uptake in Africa currently relatively small

JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Reuters) - Adding streaming services will give Africa's biggest pay-TV group, MultiChoice, a head start when online viewing takes off on the continent, it said on Thursday, after revealing it had deals with Netflix and Amazon.

CEO Calvo Mawela, in a presentation on Thursday, did not name the partners or give further details of the partnerships but the deals with Netflix and Amazon were included in the company's results presentation on its website.

""We need to start preparing ourselves to make sure... we become the platform of choice for people to consume these services,"" he said, in the presentation on Thursday, referring to streaming.

""If you are a one-stop-shop where they can get all of this... we position ourselves very well in the market for us to gain customers,"" he said.

Netflix poses a growing competitive threat to MultiChoice and its own streaming service, Showmax, and the partnership move marks a shift in MultiChoice's strategy from trying to compete with such players to working with them instead.

MultiChoice declined to answer Reuters when questioned on the partnerships.

Netflix and Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

MultiChoice currently serves 19.5 million households in 50 African countries, but outside of its home market, South Africa, it believes poor internet access currently makes a rapid uptake of streaming services unlikely.

Chief Financial Officer Tim Jacobs said on Wednesday that because there was still limited overlap between the services the company sees all of them as complementary.

MultiChoice on Wednesday reported its first annual profit since being spun off by parent Naspers.

133,2020-06-10T10:10:51+00:00,Big oil might really see a decade of change in one year: Morning Brief,"Wednesday, June 10, 2020

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET.

When the industry is in secular decline, recessions accelerate trends.

A common phrase that has become received business wisdom in this pandemic crisis is that 10 years of change will happen in one year.

Some of the early returns on this are mixed.

Shares of Zoom (ZM), for instance, have gone up a lot as people do more video calls. Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) shares have outperformed amid increasing demand for at-home deliveries and at-home entertainment.

But not all changes forced upon us because of shelter-at-home policies and concerns about public health seem likely to stick around.

Working from home, for example, is fine for a bit. And indeed, some tech companies like Twitter (TWTR) will give employees the option to work from home on a permanent basis. Other tech leaders including Google (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai, however, have expressed some skepticism that distributed workforces will be the rule instead of the exception in the future.

And with the arrival of summer and broad state reopenings in the U.S., we see consumers returning to restaurants, casinos, and traveling. In recent weeks, airline, casino, and cruise stocks have rebounded sharply as investors cast doubt on the idea that our post-COVID future will look nothing like the past. And this coming despite the virus still spreading at a faster rate in several states.

But for industries already in the midst of secular upheavals, the coronavirus pandemic does indeed seem to be an accelerant for permanent change in the way that pundits predicted.

Few industries entered like the 2020s facing a decade of transformational change quite like big oil.

And the industry's pandemic response has indeed been swift and large-scale.

On Monday, BP (BP) said that it would lay off 15% of its workforce, or about 10,000 of its 70,100 employees, according to Reuters.

Story continues

Reuters added that BP CEO Bernard Looney told staff, ""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower-carbon company.” A BP spokesman added that the pandemic ""amplified and accelerated"" BP's transition plans, according to Reuters.

Other companies in the energy space including Chevron (CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-A) among others have also announced planned reductions in their workforce.

Goldman Sachs strategists highlighted commentary from Schlumberger’s (SLB) earnings call in a report last month after management told analysts that, “we have accelerated our remote operation and automation of some of our operations. In the month of March, we had more than 60%, 6-0, 60% of our drilling [operations]...that were using remote operation.”

Because while the price of oil has rebounded over the last six weeks following the unprecedented move into negative territory in April, the industry is still facing a future in which demand for oil will be lower while demands for reducing negative climate impacts will be higher.

The rally in stocks like Nikola (NKLA) and Tesla (TSLA) — while certainly part of a mania sweeping through the retail segment of the market — can also be seen as part of a future in which the shift to clean energy is less talk and more action.

And a future that may indeed bring a decade’s worth of changes to big oil in the next year alone.

134,2020-05-22T14:33:31+00:00,3 Top Trades As We Head Into the Last Week of May,"Each week I try to identify a key theme that defined the movement in stock prices over the past 5 days. But unlike many investors, my searching isn’t based on news, it’s based on price.

The charts tell the tale, if investors are keen to listen. This week’s exercise revealed clear rotation going on beneath the market’s surface, and directed me to these top trades for your consideration.

The first part of the shift was money flowing out of leaders and into laggards. Large-caps have long been leading the market recovery, while small-caps have lagged.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But not this week! The switcheroo saw little guys pick up the torch and lead their bigger brethren to victory. As of Thursday’s close, the S&P 500 was only up 3% but the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), which represents small-caps, was up 7.3%.

The second shift is partially related to the first. Stocks benefiting from the novel coronavirus saw profit-taking while economically sensitive equities (like small-caps) surged. That’s a welcome development that points to risk appetite continuing its return.

7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar

Here’s the silver lining. If you’ve been waiting for a dip before buying companies outperforming during the Covid-19 crisis, then here’s your chance. These three stocks have attractive setups that make them top trades for the week:

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) Newmont Mining(NYSE:NEM)

Let’s take a closer look at their respective pullbacks and build trades to profit.

3 Top Trades for the Week Ahead: Netflix (NFLX)

Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade

Netflix is the type of no-brainer stock that should leave investors who didn’t buy during the March crash kicking themselves. NFLX was bound to do well during a time when content-hungry consumers were ordered to stay home.

Netflix was one of the first stocks to recover and has since gone on to record highs. This week’s rotation saw profit-taking strike the streaming king even as the rest of the market rallied.

Story continues

The pullback tested the rising 20-day moving average and held on Thursday. But even if the stock dips further, I think you have to view the weakness as a golden opportunity to get in on one of the top trades in the market at lower prices. Since it’s always wise to have a plan in case you’re wrong, I suggest watching $400 or the 50-day moving average as your line in the sand. If we push below that, then I’d change my bullish tune.

Its higher price tag makes NFLX stock a great candidate for bull put spreads. We can create a wide profit zone in case the retreat continues before buyers emerge.

The Trade: Sell the June $395/$300 bull put spread for around 90 cents.

Citrix Systems (CTXS)

Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade

Citrix Systems has been among those tech stocks seriously benefiting from the work from home trend. Its share price was up 40% year-to-date before the recent drop.

This week’s selling did inflict damage to the overall trend by jamming shares below the 50-day moving average. It’s the deepest retreat we’ve seen in CTXS since March, so I suspect some would-be buyers are hesitant.

The reason I don’t mind putting money to work here is twofold. First, we can wait for the stock to return above the 50-day before pulling the trigger. That will invalidate the breakdown and return CTXS stock to a healthy status.

Second, the underlying themes driving CTXS haven’t changed this week. And that makes me believe this is a simple correction, rather than the beginning of a trend-ending sell-off. We can deploy a strategy that gives the stock some room to flounder and still profit.

7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar

The Trade: Sell the June $125/$120 bull put spread for 70 cents. CTXS options aren’t that liquid, so you must use limit orders.

Newmont Mining (NEM)

Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade

Gold and gold stocks have been on fire this year. Economic upheaval and the printing of trillions of dollars is breathing new life into the bullish thesis for owning precious metal related products. And the Vaneck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) has more than doubled from March lows.

As one of the largest players in the space, Newmont Mining has been riding the rising tide. It even came within a whisper of all-time highs, which is incredible given that the sector fund (GDX) is still 50% off its peak.

NEM stock’s leadership makes it a top trade pick if you’re looking for exposure to the yellow metal. Buying an outperforming stock in an outperforming sector means you’re betting on the strongest possible candidate.

This week’s rotation saw profit-taking strike and is creating a classic buy-the-dip opportunity. Every pullback this year has been a great chance to buy, and I see no reason why we should view this one differently. If you want to increase your odds of success, I like selling naked puts. You’re essentially getting paid for your willingness to acquire the stock.

The Trade: Sell the June $60 put for around $1.45.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Well, you have been watching the panel hosted by Fed members, including Jerome Powell. You also heard from lael Brainard, just discussing how the coronavirus has been impacting the broader economy, really all aspects of the economy. They talked about jobs. They talked about what some of the different programs have done in order to try and help boost the economy.

So for more reaction, I want to bring back in Brian Cheung. And we're also joined by Kristina Hooper, Invesco chief global market strategist, once again. And Brian, I mean, just some of the headlines that stuck out to me was Powell really at the beginning just talking about this burden and how it's been widespread, but not evenly spread. And that's been placed on those who are least able to bear it.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Yeah, that's right. So you heard from Jay Powell. He actually just jumped in, in the question and answer portion of this discussion, which, as you notice, has been fairly informal. It's not like those usual speeches that you hear from these Fed officials. And Chairman Powell asking a lot of these participants, hey, are people going back to work? Are jobs starting to come back? As we know, in certain [AUDIO OUT]

SEANA SMITH: Brian, it looks like you just jumped on mute real quick. There you go.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Sorry about that, Seana. But as I was mentioning, Chairman Powell asking the question, are people going back to work? And I think this really signals that the Federal Reserve is interested in, I guess, the speed at which we might start to see a recovery happen, right? So we already know, based on what Fed officials have already messaged, that the second quarter, which would cover the period of April to June, is going to be very bad.

Story continues

But as we get closer to the end of May, if people do start to come back to work, that could be a hint that we might get to see some of that recovery in the second half of this year, as the Federal Reserve has acknowledged.

But I think largely what is unique about this appearance is that the Federal Reserve is reaching out to specifically these community members who can share their side of things. You heard that very human story from BAFL CIO representative, who said that he had to drive his family member who had cancer around, you know, and trying to protect and make sure that his family wasn't getting COVID if they were already vulnerable, but have to go to a job that requires them to be interfacing with other people-- a very dangerous situation.

So this is a moment where the Federal Reserve, which we tend to associate with big macroeconomic terms that most people don't understand, is trying to kind of get to the mainstream level and message and have that conversation and dialogue about how this crisis is really affecting those on Main Street. Because as Chairman Powell had said, those are really the people that are being most affected.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Kristina, I want to bring you back into the conversation here. Because when we talk about Main Street, I also just want to relate it into Wall Street and really, how Wall Street is digesting some of those comments from the Fed today, just exactly what it means just in terms of the pace and the timeline, potentially, of this recovery. Kristina, it looks like you are muted, so if you could take us.

KRISTINA HOOPER: Sorry about that. It looks like Wall Street isn't that concerned with the economic scenario because of the decoupling. But the reality is that the Fed is very concerned about it. We saw that today in the comments from Jay Powell and lael Brainard. And in fact, we also saw it in the FOMC minutes yesterday.

There was something that I don't think got a lot of attention, but the Fed staff talked about the base case scenario in terms of an economic recovery, but also noted that their bear case scenario was just as plausible. And so I think there is a lot of concern on the part of the Fed. Of course, the Fed has a limited tool box, and so many of the policies that it would employ to try to help the economy might benefit markets more than it actually benefits the general economy.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Kristina, just how do you take this all into account when you're trying to come up with your own forecast and your own models? Because we heard Fed chair Jerome Powell saying in his prepared remarks that economic forecasts will be very difficult at this point, just because there is so many unknowns out there. Because a lot of it just pertains to really just trying to mitigate the spread of this virus.

KRISTINA HOOPER: Absolutely. There are so many unknowns. We just don't know a lot about the virus itself. We're learning more information on a daily basis. In addition, of course, we don't know what's going to come in terms of fiscal stimulus. How much are we going to get to maintain solvency for households and businesses?

So I think it's very, very difficult to predict what's going to happen. Our base case is that we see a slow and uneven recovery to start with. But certainly, the path of public policy, whether it's health policy or fiscal policy or monetary policy, will certainly help dictate the different macro scenarios and how likely they are to come to fruition.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Christina, it's Brian here. I wanted to ask. I mean, what do you think is the dashboard of data that the Fed Reserve is closely dialed into? We know this story on the jobless claims. We know this story on GDP. It seems like they already have expectations. But the Fed is going to have to start modeling their own forecasts in the June [INAUDIBLE] figures. What do you think is going to be the big key on the either prices side of things or on the employment side of things to watch for?

KRISTINA HOOPER: Well, I think that anything that is more leading in nature. So initial jobless claims are going to carry a lot of weight with the Fed. But I'm sure that they're going to look at a wide variety of data. Keep in mind when Janet Yellen was Fed chair, she looked at a mosaic of 19 different metrics just related to the labor market.

And so there's just, I think, a voluminous amount of data that the Fed will be paying attention to that will paint a mosaic that helps them try to divine where the economy is. But again, there are so many unknowns, and so much of it is health related, which is completely out of the area of expertise of the Fed.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Yeah, and as we mentioned, Kristina-- thanks again for pointing that out. But you know, the Federal Reserve is also really paying attention to the forward guidance aspect of things, right? That's something that the Federal Reserve is definitely going to have to watch here. Actually, in the Fed minutes yesterday, there was debate about whether or not it should be outcome-based or date-based. But regardless, a lot of things worth watching there.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/feds-jerome-powell-u-economy-194711962.html?.tsrc=rss,"['BA.US', 'CAT.US', 'CLN19.NYM', 'CPB.US', 'DE.US', 'DJI.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'NFLX.US', 'TNX.INDX', 'TVIX.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VIX.INDX', 'XLB.US', 'XLE.US', 'XLF.US', 'XLI.US', 'XLK.US', 'XLP.US', 'XLPI.US']","['BRIAN CHEUNG', 'CHAIRMAN POWELL', 'FED', 'FEDERAL RESERVE', 'JAY POWELL', 'JEROME POWELL', 'LAEL BRAINARD', 'THE FED']","{'polarity': 0.995, 'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.074}"
136,2020-05-13T14:36:23+00:00,Mediaset CFO says ProSieben important partner but not the only one,"MILAN, May 13 (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset has built a stake in German rival ProSiebenSat.1 Media because it sees consolidation in the industry as inevitable but it will retain a flexible stance and may consider other partners, CFO Marco Giordani said.

Milan-based Mediaset wants to merge its Italian and Spanish businesses into a Dutch entity, dubbed MediaforEurope (MFE), and use this to pursue tie-ups in Europe to take on competition from streaming apps such as Netflix and web giants like Google.

In emailed comments to Reuters, Giordani said that the group controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was ""receiving a lot of interest from investors and other media operators in Europe around our (MFE) project.""

""(ProSieben) may be an important partner for that project but it is not the only one,"" he added. Earlier on Wednesday, Giordani had said the group was happy with its 24.2% stake in ProSieben.

He said Mediaset had no plans to appoint a representative to ProSieben's supervisory board at the German group's annual general meeting on June 10.

""It is not our style to make aggressive moves or to appear as a hostile shareholder. We will remain at the same time flexible and long term committed to our idea of industrial development,"" he said.

""The decision to increase our stake in ProsSieben has been taken from this perspective: consolidation in Europe will happen in any case.""

137,2020-05-07T19:28:43+00:00,Nasdaq Stock Exchange president on IPO outlook amid COVID-19,"Nasdaq Stock Exchange President Nelson Griggs joins Yahoo Finance’s Seana Smith to discuss market operations amid the coronavirus and the outlook on IPOs.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance's live market coverage. Now, the coronavirus outbreak has upended US equities trading. The New York Stock Exchange has closed its trading floor, and the NASDAQ has closed its option floor in Philadelphia. Now, all of this happening, of course, as we've seen market volatility spikes.

So let's get more on this. And for that, we have Nelson Griggs, president of the NASDAQ stock exchange. And Nelson, thanks so much for taking the time to join the show this afternoon. We're excited to have you on. I guess let's start with-- give us a sense of what the last two months have been like with your entire operations working remotely.

NELSON GRIGGS: Sure, well thanks for having me. So historically, we are about a 4% work from home and very quickly went to a 98% work from home. If you think about the exchange's responsibility, though, we have been through shutdowns before over Sandy, et cetera. But most of the BCP planning, the backup planning, is thought about in terms of days and weeks, not globally for months. So we did very quickly put plans in place. We were pretty early on this because of what we saw happening with our operations in Hong Kong.

So we have been incredibly resilient, I think not just NASDAQ but the entire Street. I think we all feared the worst, in terms of what it would be like to work from home. And it has been really-- from a market operations, obviously there's a lot of volatility, but it's been really seamless.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, can you talk about-- I mean, at a time when there's so much uncertainty and there's so much volatility in the markets, it's spooking a lot of investors out there. What kind of relief measures are you providing to listed companies at this point?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think the one thing that comes up in times like this, and we saw this as well in the financial crisis, is companies that are on what we call more of the smaller cap end of the range, concerned about rules around having that minimum dollar bid price, minimum market values. And the SEC has been great to work with. Both ourselves as well as the competing exchanges have come up with plans that have been very-- the SEC has been very receptive to give temporary relief for those companies with the idea is that this is probably more of a temporary downturn and then we'll come back. And we saw that in the financial crisis.

Story continues

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Nelson, you talk about the fact that it could be a temporary downturn. We have shifted our focus almost, or I guess the direction of our conversation recently, talking about people getting back to work, the return to work here, and the potential return to-- I don't know if we want to put it in quotes, but what normalcy will look like going forward. What do you think that could look like?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think what's interesting to us is-- so we do operate in over 30 countries. So it is a very country by country, even-- and then you get to the US, it's state by state. There's a lot of local regulations and rules to figure out about what we actually can do with our employee base. So it's going to be gradual.

We are fortunate. Our business is very resilient, so we're not forced to go back early, by any means. But our hope is that we see gradual returning to work with a lot of precautionary measures around temperature testing, social distancing. The biggest thing to figure out early are transportation-- public transportation and how do you get a workforce to work?

So it's a daily call we have with our executive leadership team to talk about how that could look, but I think we all have to be understanding that it's going to take some time and it's going to be gradual and we should expect it to be-- you know, have a bit of a lumpy effect.

SEANA SMITH: Hey Nelson, so when we talk about returning to work, some of the questions I guess that have been raised I've been reading about is whether or not US exchange trading floors are still going to be relevant post-coronavirus. I know the NASDAQ in particular, it's mostly remote trading. You mostly do it all online. But what are your thoughts on that, just in terms of what we could expect going forward and what will be necessary going forward?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, I think we'd separate the equities market from the options market. There's unique components of the options market. We still see value in a floor. But it's pretty clear during this time with the equities market, most of the volume today is happening away from a floor environment, as is we measure the quality of trading. And we do feel that NASDAQ does electronic trading the best in the world. But electronic trading better serves investors because there's not really that conflict of interests that we see in the floor-based models for equities.

So you know, we'll see how the floor-based markets-- there's really only one left, how it comes back. But I think at this time, investors are actually being served very well with tight spreads, liquidity, and we're seeing the markets operate very, very efficiently.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, I want to hear your thoughts on the IPO market because it's come to nearly a standstill over the last several weeks. So how do you think-- or how has coronavirus reshaped the 2020 IPO timeline?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, well, it certainly has reshaped it. It hasn't come to a complete stop. We have had six health care companies, biotechs go public, and we do believe we'll have more. And there actually is a small pipeline developing of companies that were on the cusp of going public in February and March that still have an active dialogue going about a June, July timeframe.

But clearly, the biggest challenge for a companies when you do go public is you need to forecast your-- you know, your financials for the remainder of the year, the coming year, and that's gotten very hard for many businesses. So we still think there can be an IPO market.

That's part of the reason why you see health care being successful is because the lack of need for forecasting. They're talking about, you know, two years, four years, five years down the road for developing drugs. But we do think we'll start seeing the IPO market open up a bit in June, July, August, but be fairly slow. And then we do think it'll pick up more robustly as the year progresses. There's a lot of companies would like to go.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Nelson, you mentioned the fact that you've had six companies go public. How are you facilitating those virtual IPOs. What exactly does that process look like at this point?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, that's a great question. So as mentioned, we've been incredibly impressed with our partners, the trading firms, the banks that do trade through NASDAQ. So they can really operate as they do today. NASDAQ operates, as we always have-- we provide a very robust tools-- toolkit to companies, investors to go public-- or sorry, the trading desks. And we have our team that does that. So that that's been very, very fluid.

The challenge for companies is if you think about what a roadshow used to be, it used to be going for eight days to all these different cities on planes. And now it's usually been four days on video. But I would say the deals that have come out have all been received very, very well. They've traded well. And I think that companies were able to get their message across, you know, clearly enough to drive that investor demand, so different but also surprisingly successful.

SEANA SMITH: Nelson, real quick, in your line of work as the president of the NASDAQ stock exchange, you talk to a lot of executives because it's in your line of business. What are you hearing from these CEOs? What are you hearing from these executives, just about their outlook over the next couple of months?

NELSON GRIGGS: Yeah, and I think we look-see a little bit that's developing actually in the market in performance. It clearly has been a market where technology, health care have done very well. The averages there-- the NASDAQ 100, the NASDAQ composite, the biotech-- are actually positive now for the year. Clearly, value stocks in certain sectors have been hit very hard.

So I think you do need to look at the market, look at companies on a very individualist basis. What does their sector look like? But clearly, everyone says a lot of consistent themes. They think about their employees, their health, their safety and well-being.

And then depending on which side of the market they're on, it's either how do I accelerate through this and find new opportunities? For some, they're thinking about, OK, I need to really conserve cash, find cash, and prepare myself for, you know, a handful more quarters or even a year or so, what's going to be a slower market for their businesses.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Nelson Griggs, president of the NASDAQ stock exchange, thanks so much for joining me today.

138,2020-05-06T22:00:36+00:00,Crazy Trading on China's Nasdaq Has Its Own Logic,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Old habits die hard. China’s Nasdaq-like ChiNext board has staged a comeback this year, rallying 17% to trade at an average of — yes, really — 70 times earnings. Is this misguided enthusiasm by an investor base that infamously engineered a stomach-churning crash just five years ago?

All the conventional wisdom points to irrationality. The ChiNext is composed mostly of young, small and volatile enterprises, whereas blue chips are far better placed to weather the coronavirus outbreak. First-quarter earnings reports from China’s domestically listed companies just drove home the point.

The data show an irrefutable connection between market value and earnings resilience. Companies with a market cap of more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) increased their sales and operating profit at the median, despite the virus-related lockdowns. By contrast, the median smaller company recorded a double-digit decline in earnings.

What’s surprising, though, is that not all earnings for ChiNext members are bad. The new-economy market is a story of ice and fire. While more than half of companies reported a drop in net income, almost a quarter posted earnings growth of at least 30%. In other words, performance was either sub-zero or very hot, with little in between.

That makes the ChiNext an attractive market for stock pickers who fancy they can pick the hot prospects from the frozen waste. This makes sense for investors, since China has no equivalent of the FANGs — the mega-cap technology stocks that have made the U.S. equity market the world’s best performer. In China, the well-loved large caps are in booze and drugs — and these are already richly valued and crowded.

A case in point is Kweichow Moutai Co., maker of the fiery liquor known as baijiu and the world’s most valuable distiller. Moutai’s 1.6 trillion yuan market value is now equal to the entire gross domestic product of Guizhou province, where the company is based. How much upside can there be left for an alcohol producer whose basic product costs just shy of 2,400 yuan, or close to $340 a a bottle? That’s more than the minimum monthly wage in China’s capital, Beijing. Unlike FANG members Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc., Moutai surely can't be considered a play on middle-class consumption.

Story continues

Chinese investors also have a different vision of value. For them, value isn’t about cheap metrics such as low price-to-book or price-earnings ratios. Rather, it’s determined by how fast a small cap can morph into a blue chip. This explains why investors love Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., which supplies batteries to Tesla Inc. They hope it can become as indispensable to Elon Musk’s electric-car maker as Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. did to Apple Inc.

To be sure, this is all risky business. Beijing recently approved plans to move to a registration-based system for initial public offerings on ChiNext. That means a flood of new companies with even less vetting will be arriving on the board. It’s also worth noting that the quarterly earnings of these young and inexperienced companies aren’t audited.

But then traders on ChiNext aren’t buying stocks so much as options. They’re sifting for China’s future FANGs.

139,2020-04-30T19:48:09+00:00,Tesla turns negative after David Einhorn questions billing practices,"Yahoo Finance’s Emily McCormick joins Seana Smith to break down why short-seller David Einhorn is questioning Tesla's billing practices.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Tesla shares reversing and are now down more than 4%. Now this comes despite the fact that the company revealed a surprise profit in the first quarter.

For more on this, we have Emily McCormick in. Emily, it's a little bit interesting when you take a look at the stock performance today. We were up over 4%, now down in the red, off over 4%. Why are we seeing a reversal so far today?

EMILY MCCORMICK: Well, Seana, we did have some news come out partway through today's session. We had David Einhorn, the president of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, challenging Tesla's billing practices in an open letter to Elon Musk posted on Twitter earlier today. He specifically took issue with Tesla's accounts receivable, particularly since Tesla still posted solid results even though the company likely saw sales lower at the end of the quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic, and that's usually the part of the quarter that Tesla relies on to really see a bump for quarterly results overall.

So that call-- getting that called into question is something that really sparked the reversal that we're seeing. The stock had been up more than 8% during the overnight session and earlier on around market open, and that was because of these much better results that we saw for the first quarter. So that was a first-quarter profit that had been unexpected as well as an about 30% rise in sales to nearly $6 billion.

We did see free cash flow about negative $895 million. But for at least the overnight session, that was something that the Street wasn't as focused on. Really, there had been a lot of optimism around the ramp of the Model Y, the fact that we had automotive gross margins improving to 25 and 1/2% in the first quarter, which was an improvement versus just about 23% over last year. And still a pretty good margin at 20% even when you exclude those regulatory credits.

Story continues

So an interesting story that we've seen play out between the earnings, the David Einhorn challenge this afternoon, and then now seeing the stock down about 4%.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Emily, I want to ask about the coronavirus impact that that's going to have on Tesla. Do you have any more information about that? Because it was interesting just in terms of what Elon Musk was saying about-- when he was asked about a potential slowdown. He said it was still pedal to the metal on new products and also plans for expanding the company.

EMILY MCCORMICK: Right. Well, Elon Musk did give a rather colorful earnings call yesterday after market close. He called the coronavirus social-distancing measures akin to, quote, ""forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights."" He later conflated it with fascism. So he definitely didn't have a lot of positive things to say about the coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures that have emerged because of it.

Now, Tesla did have to shut down its Fremont factory, its flagship Fremont auto facility, at the end of the day starting March 23. So that's been a weeks-long closure that is really threatening Tesla when it comes to those delivery goals that it had at the beginning of the year. In January, Tesla said it had hoped to-- or it believed it would comfortably exceed 500,000 vehicle deliveries this year, although analysts are now saying that that's much more unlikely given the nature of the pandemic and the way that it's impacted both the supply chain and demand for autos overall.

142,2020-04-28T14:46:57+00:00,Peloton Meets Greengrocer: Farmshelf Launches Home Version of Indoor Farming System,"By John Jannarone

From Peloton Interactive Inc. to Netflix, Inc., companies offering at-home technologies to keep people busy, healthy and entertained during the lockdown have thrived. The latest high-tech offering: a fully-automated indoor farm for greens and herbs, all housed within a sleek case the size of a bookshelf.

Farmshelf, which currently sells a professional device popular with celebrity chefs like José Andrés, has launched Farmshelf Home, a slightly smaller version designed specifically for home use. Farmshelf Home, which is available for pre-order, features a remotely-controlled hydroponic system and an app that monitors the miniature crop with cameras and sensors. Everything from hydration to airflow to nutrients are controlled by the machine, with owners simply needing to occasionally refill water and harvest plants.

“Our mission has always been to make it easy for people to grow their own food where they live, work and eat. We started where they work and eat at restaurants and corporate cafes, now we are coming to the home,” said Andrew Shearer, founder and CEO of Farmshelf. “Giving people the opportunity to harvest food as it’s needed will not only elevate the idea of ‘farm to table, but help reduce the ongoing cycle of food waste.”

Farmshelf Home is truly the first of its kind. While other contraptions exist such as a tabletop system from The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, they are relatively small. Farmshelf Home produces enough to cover a meaningful part of a weekly shopping list: a sample harvest includes 8 heads of lettuce, 8 bunches of herbs, and 8 bunches of greens.

“The food we eat was not designed to ship 1500 miles,” Mr. Shearer said. “We are going from shipping food miles to shipping food a few feet. It really changes the equation.”

Users can choose from a diverse menu of over 40 different herbs, leafy greens, and edible flowers. Choices include staples like romaine lettuce along with more exotic plants such as shiso and viola flowers.

Story continues

The system also reduces food waste because users simply trim whatever ingredients they need for a meal. Farmshelf estimates the system, which sells for $4,950 on pre-order and has a $35 monthly fee for seeds and other essentials, can save users up to $2,500 a year in grocery bills.

The system also has advantages over normal gardening. Thanks to the controlled atmosphere and technology, plants grow three times as fast and need 90% less water. There’s also no need for pesticides or herbicides, meaning users technically can eat greens without washing them.

While away from home, users can keep an eye on their plants through the mobile app. It features live camera views and sends alerts for needs such as a water refill.

The success of the professional model suggests Farmshelf Home will be a hit. Farmshelf is very popular with superstar chefs like Mr. Andrés, who actually has a professional version in his own home. He recently tweeted a video of one of his Farmshelf units, raving about romaine lettuce.

Farmshelf also serves large groups of diners at schools and corporate cafeterias. American Express Company, for instance, uses multiple Farmshelf systems to serve 3,000 people per day.

To date, Farmshelf has raised over $8 million privately. Mr. Shearer said the company may seek more capital in the future as it continues to grow.

143,2020-04-28T01:25:11+00:00,"Google, Starbucks, AMD earnings: What to know in markets Tuesday","Earnings season kicks into high gear Tuesday. A slew of big names will deliver quarterly results, but the spotlight will be on Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) after the closing bell.

Alphabet is expected to report adjusted earnings of $13.97 per share on $32.56 billion in revenue during its first quarter. The tech giant’s results could be negatively impacted by its exposure to the travel industry, which accounts for approximately 11% of search and revenue. Ad revenue will have likely taken a hit amid COVID-19, but Alphabet’s cloud business could remain a bright spot, according to analysts.

“We believe Street estimates for Q1 are likely optimistic, given the material pullback in ad spend due to COVID-19. Management commentary on near-term Ad Revenue outlook will be key,” RBC analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note April 24.

So far this year, Alphabet shares are down 4%, while the broader market declined 10%. In the same period, Facebook (FB) sank 6%, Netflix (NFLX) soared 31%, Amazon (AMZN) jumped 30% and Apple (AAPL) fell 3%.

Coffee giant Starbucks is estimated to report adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share on $5.90 billion in revenue during its fiscal second quarter.

Starbucks provided a business update on April 8 and outlined the impact that it had seen as a result of COVID-19. At the time, the company said that same-store sales in the U.S. during the quarter fell 3% and same-store sales in the last week of March declined 60% to 70%. Meanwhile, sales tanked 50% in China during the quarter, according to the company.

Last week, Starbucks announce that it would be offering Beyond Meat (BYND) products in China. Shares of the coffee chain are down 11% this year.

Finally, chipmaker AMD is expected to report adjusted earnings of 18 cents per share on $1.79 billion in revenue during its first quarter. While COVID-19 likely hit AMD’s PC and gaming chip businesses, data center CPU & GPU sales to cloud customers probably benefited this year.

Story continues

“Tailwinds [for AMD] include strong cloud demand, low exposure to enterprise, and resurgent gaming,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note April 27. “Risks include 2H PC/console pull-ins/delays. However, AMD's smaller footprint in PC's (15% share) and competitive new products mitigates PC risk, in our view. On consoles, while a delayed launch is possible, demand should be fine, given major spec upgrades, and a re-invigorated/re-engaged gaming demographic.”

Other major earnings reports scheduled for Tuesday include PepsiCo (PEP), Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM), Pfizer (PFE), DR Horton (DHI), Harley-Davidson (HOG), UPS (UPS), Southwest Airlines (LUV) before market open; Mondelez (MDLZ), Ford (F) after market close.

Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley joins Seana Smith to discuss.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Let's talk about Apple. The company is reportedly delaying mass production of its 2020 flagship iPhones. Now the Wall Street Journal's saying that it'll be pushed back by just around a monthly. We have Dan Howley here with us to discuss this story.

And Dan, you and I have talked about in the past, we've heard rumors and the fact that Apple could potentially delay some of its new iPhones. Wall Street Journal now saying that this will, in fact, happen just in terms of production being pushed off. How significant do you think this is? Because I think a lot of the investor excitement for this year's 5G release was really what helped send Apple shares to record highs earlier this year.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, this is already basically built into the stock price, the 5G iPhone. And I think the expectation that it may not launch on time as well has been priced, and I think the issue for Apple would be how long of a delay it could be. Now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that it would be about a month off of the normal schedule for when it would be released as a result of mass production, issues related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic.

We were previously discussing with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives about Apple potentially putting off the unveiling of the device itself. Usually, what happens is you see a new iPhone come out around the September 12th, second week of September time frame. And then the device itself comes out two weeks later, and then you have that continued push of buyers up until the holidays, where you get the real huge uplift. And then that continues into the first half of the year and then slowly trickles off as a newer iPhone comes out that next September.

But if they end up pushing it off, I think really what you're going to see is just built up anticipation for this device. And then when they do have it released fully, can Apple keep up with that anticipation? Because this will be the first 5G device reportedly that Apple is expected to release, and that will be a hot seller, especially with all the hype around 5G.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-delays-mass-production-2020-192837024.html?.tsrc=rss,"['$E@EMCF.US', '0E7A.DU', '0J2X.XETRA', '0P00000PQH.F', '0P0000WN2O.LSE', '1096.HK', '58F178.KO', '6824.TSE', '91USC.NX', '9A90B.NX', '9E91B.NX', 'A50HZ.NX', 'AAPL.BA', 'AAPL.MI', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.SN', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL.VI', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AAPLC.BA']","['APPLE', 'DAN HOWLEY', 'MASS PRODUCTION', 'WALL STREET JOURNAL']","{'polarity': 0.895, 'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.056}"
145,2020-04-27T17:28:42+00:00,Why nobody on Wall Street really cares that Apple is reportedly delaying new iPhone releases,"If you’re Apple (AAPL), it pays to have gobs of cash and a gazillion plugged in sell-side analysts obsessively covering your stock. That’s especially so right now amidst a global health pandemic that has crushed the global economy and has made buying a new $1,000-plus iPhone sometime this year seem silly (if not financially impossible for many).

Shares of the tech behemoth barely budged on Monday following a story in the Wall Street Journal that Apple would push back the production of its latest iPhones by roughly a month. Apple typically releases several new handsets in the fall just before the holiday shopping season.

The company is reportedly working on four new iPhones for release this year, some with 5G capability.

Two Apple spokesmen didn’t return Yahoo Finance’s request for comment on the WSJ report.

At first blush, one would think news of a delay of any kind for fresh iPhones would be negative to Apple’s stock price. Not necessarily for a few reasons, strategists say.

First, a delay in the production ramp has been discussed at length on Wall Street and factored into a good chunk of profit estimates on Apple and the stock. Apple shares are down about 4% year-to-date, lagging the gains in other Big Cap tech stocks such as Microsoft (+10%), Amazon (+30%) and Netflix (+30%).

“This is right in line with our and many Street expectations with 5G slated to hit in late November/early December pre holidays,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

More important is that Apple is still — apparently — planning to have its new iPhones in the market before the critical holiday shopping season. By then, many would agree the U.S. economy will be in far better shape than it is today and interest in buying a new iPhone higher.

“This is something that was expected. The going thought is we push it forward or back a little bit [iPhone production]. That still gives people enough time to purchase devices for the important holiday season,” explained Futurum Research founder Daniel Newman on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Story continues Rows of iPhones are displayed Saturday, March 14, 2020, inside a closed Apple store in downtown Brooklyn in New York.

In the meantime, while major production delays would cripple the finances of most manufacturers, Apple is not a normal manufacturer. It’s a tech beast selling hardware that generates real-time money through various services and downloads. In turn, sell-side analysts estimate Apple will produce nearly $60 billion in free cash flow this year. That will easily allow Apple to fund a solid dividend and steady stream of profit-cushioning stock buybacks.

Apple ended its fiscal year (year ended Dec. 28) with more than $107 billion in cash and short-term investments.

“With a company with that much cash on their balance sheet, they are in a strong position to weather volatility,” notes Apple bull and chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments Victoria Fernandez.

And weather production delays, too.

146,2020-04-27T13:20:20+00:00,In Case Whitney Tilson Is Right About Netflix This Time,"Whitney Tilson Warns Netflix Longs

Former fund manager Whitney Tilson has been busy recently. In addition to offering his readers a deal on toilet paper and other household goods, and “partnerships” in his newsletter, Tilson also warned them about holding Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) at current levels:

The first-quarter results were impressive in terms of net subscriber additions and operating margin expansion, but Berna [Barshay, Tilson's colleague] has a warning for investors... I would be cautious chasing the stock here, and if I was long, I would consider taking profits on at least part of my position.

Readers who recall that Tilson shorted Netflix ten years ago, and are mindful of the stock's performance since... Whitney Tilson Netflix

Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more

May view Tilson's word of caution on Netflix now as a contrarian indicator. And indeed, my own system, Portfolio Armor, is bullish on it now, as you can see in the screen capture below, where it came in at #33 on our daily ranking of securities on Wednesday. Whitney Tilson Netflix

Screen capture via Portfolio Armor's admin panel.

But what I wrote about Amazon (AMZN) recently applies to Netflix too:

The market’s rebound since late March suggests investors are optimistic about a v-shaped economic recovery following the contraction caused by the lockdowns. That’s in contrast to economists who suggest the recovery could take years. If the market ends up agreeing, we could see another leg down where leveraged investors are forced to liquidate even their best performers

There remains a strong possibility that the market rebound since late March has been a bear rally. In the event that's the case, let's look at a couple of ways Netflix shareholders can stay long while strictly limiting their downside risk.

Bear Protection For Netflix

For these examples, I'll assume you own 200 shares of Netflix and can tolerate a decline of 22% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below come from the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.

Story continues

Uncapped Upside, Positive Cost

These were the optimal puts, as of Wednesday's close, to hedge 200 shares of NFLX against a greater-than-22% decline by late November. Whitney Tilson Netflix

The cost of this protection was $7,990, or 9.48% of position value, calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts (in practice, you can often buy and sell options at some price within the spread between the bid and ask.). That worked out to an annualized cost of 16.4% of position value, so fairly pricey.

Capped Upside, Negative Cost

If you were willing to cap your possible upside at 22% over the same time frame, you could have used the optimal collar below to get the same level of protection as above. NFLX NFLX

You might have noticed that the strike on the put leg of this collar is different than the strike on the puts in the previous hedge. After an iterative process taking into account the net cost of the collar, the hedging algorithm was able to use a less expensive strike for the put leg here, one where the cost was $5,180, or 6.15% of position value (calculated at the ask). That was more than offset by the income generated by the short call leg: $5,580, or 6.62% of position value (calculated at the bid).

So the net cost of this collar was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $400, or 0.47% of position value, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads. That worked out to an annualized cost of -0.82% of position value.

Wrapping Up: Trading Money For Time

Both of the hedges above used our default options expiration date, which is the one closest to six months out, but app users can use the drop-down to experiment with different expiration dates to see how the both the absolute cost and the annualized cost varies. As of Wednesday, for example, you could find the lowest (most negative) hedging cost not at the third furthest out expiration date (June of 2021).

147,2020-04-27T10:47:43+00:00,Coronavirus unleashes insane bubble in these 5 stocks and it could end badly for the bulls,"This market rally may be as fake as some of the bootleg hand sanitizers being hawked on Amazon and eBay at crazy prices to the worried quarantined masses.

Despite 26.45 million Americans having filed for unemployment claims the past five weeks and first quarter earnings season so far being as painful as being forced to watch “Tiger King” for the third time, the S&P 500 has rallied about 27% from the March 23 lows. The S&P 500’s forward price to earnings multiple of 21 times or so is at its highest level since right before the tech bubble back in December 2001.

Insane.

One would think we are amidst a solid economic expansion in the U.S. and accelerating EPS growth among businesses, not something as debilitating as the coronavirus pandemic.

“All the data is horrific. But it’s getting less bad than it was say a couple weeks ago and that’s especially true with jobless claims. So markets are focused on that marginal rate of change and and they think that the worst will be behind us when we move to May and June,” said Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Point well taken.

But the question right now the bulls should be asking themselves is how strong is the rally from the March lows, really? Are the bulls truly buying into the view the U.S. economy is back to its job creating, growth self this summer? Or, is the rally a mirage being fueled by heavy-hitting speculators (we see you, hedge funds) going back to tried and true winning trades in big cap tech? And in turn, this is creating the momentum that lures in the suckers just before the bottom drops out of the entire market again.

The data supports the latter observation.

The five big cap tech stocks

Coming into 2020, the five largest S&P 500 stocks comprised 18% of its market cap, matching the share at the peak of the tech bubble in March 2000, Goldman Sachs strategists note. Since then, those stocks — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook — have risen to account for 20% of the S&P 500’s market cap.

Story continues The statue of the charging bull is pictured on April 20, 2020 in New York City. - Wall Street opened lower on Monday as traders grappled with a drop in oil prices to 22-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand for energy.

(Photo by Johannes EISELE / AFP) (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)

Looked at another way, all five of those big cap tech stocks have handily outperformed the S&P 500’s 14% drop, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data — led by a 30% pop in Amazon. In effect, investors have pretty much forgotten about the other 495 stocks in the benchmark index because they have less belief in their ability to navigate the coronavirus situation for whatever reason.

A healthy market rally, however, would be under-pinned by a belief that more than five companies will successfully come out the other side. Where are the bets in industrial names? How about taking a stab at battered oil stocks — if the economy is going to burst back into gear later this year, surely we will need greater oil than the present right?

“Many market participants – ourselves included – have expressed incredulity at the fact that the S&P 500 trades just 17% below its all-time high amid the largest economic shock in nearly a century. Below the surface of the market, however, the median S&P 500 constituent trades 28% below its record high. This 11 percentage point gap is one measure of market breadth, which now stands roughly a standard deviation below its historical average,” the Goldman Sachs equities strategy team writes.

Such narrow breadth in the market comes with a warning from Goldman, as it should.

Says Goldman, “In addition to the Tech Bubble, breadth narrowed ahead of the recessions in 1990 and 2008 and the economic slowdowns of 2011 and 2016. Historically, sharply narrowing breadth has signaled below-average 1-, 3-, and 6- month S&P 500 returns as well as larger-than-average prospective drawdowns.”

And who is to say Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are worthy of their even more premium current valuations? None of these companies have reported first quarter earnings yet.

You mean to tell me 26.45 million jobless Americans doesn’t equate to reduced spending on cloud computing upgrades this year (it does)? A severe economic downturn in the U.S. like we are experiencing doesn’t mean sharply lower consumer spending (it has already, per retail sales data) and downside financial risk for Amazon? Small businesses going under will pressure advertising on Facebook.

The market will do what it wants to do in the end. What’s right though is a pause in the upward momentum in stocks, especially five enormous tech stocks.

148,2020-04-25T14:49:11+00:00,How coronavirus could accelerate the demise of cable TV,"Streaming is ballooning as the coronavirus pandemic locks most citizens indoors, and a new survey suggests it could also hastening the long-term trend of cable-cutting.

According to The Trade Desk, which surveyed nearly 3000 Americans recently, 64% of the respondents said they have either cut the cord, are planning to do so — or simply never subscribed to cable at all.

That number jumped to 75% for those aged 18-34 — suggesting that interest in cable is dwindling, especially amongst the younger generation.

“With only a quarter of young adults having any long-term interest in traditional cable TV, in a few years we won’t be talking about linear or cable TV at all. It will all be online and streaming,” The Trade Desk Chief Strategy Officer Brian Stempeck said in a statement.

A ‘billion dollar question’ The coronavirus could lead to an increase of cable-cutters as 64% of U.S. households reported a lack of longterm interest in cable TV plans (Source: The Trade Desk)

To further illustrate that point, 11% of those households that still do have cable said they plan to cut the cord by the end of this year — with 18 to 34-year-olds once again leading the charge. These trends are expected to continue, as Americans adhere to stay-at-home orders — and streamers are capitalizing on this unprecedented moment.

Netflix (NFLX) reported a record number of subscribers in the first quarter of 2020, nabbing nearly 16 million new accounts. That momentum is expected to continue even after the pandemic subsides.

“We anticipate the step-up will result in a permanent increase in penetration for Netflix's subscriber model and see its low price-point and staple nature supporting healthy fundamentals performance in a recession, even after stay-home orders are lifted,” Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler said recently. Netflix adds 15.7 million global users in Q1 2020 amid coronavirus pandemic (Source: Netflix, NYT)

Furthermore, the absence of live sports is also causing subscribers to rethink their cable plans. The majority of Americans (60%) say watching live sports is the primary reason they’ve kept their subscriptions in the first place, according to the survey.

Still, a larger question remains of whether or not streaming services will be able to keep people entertained when life eventually returns to normal.

Story continues

“That is the billion dollar question right now,” Raymond James analyst Justin Patterson told Yahoo Finance this week.

The answer, Patterson said, likely lies in Netflix’s ability to continue to provide localized content to its various international markets — and the platform is willing to cough up big bucks to do just that.

The streamer announced on Wednesday that it will raise an additional $1 billion in debt to fund original programming and acquire new content, positioning itself as a major threat to U.S. studios whose futures now hang in the balance.

149,2020-04-25T11:58:44+00:00,No more new TV shows or movies. Here's how to survive,"Only a few months ago we were complaining there were too many TV shows to watch, and that it was impossible to keep up.

Now is the time to catch up.

The coronavirus has stopped the production of movies and TV shows cold. In a matter of weeks we’ve gone lickety-split from peak content to trough content, i.e., no new shows.

What does this shutdown mean for Disney, Netflix, YouTube, and HBO et al., and never mind the media-entertainment-complex, what about all of us couch-potatoing our lives away during the pandemic?

I put those questions to legendary media investor Mario Gabelli, and he suggested all this was going to engender some serious seismic change.

“You have a lot of stuff that was put in the pipeline,” Gabelli said with his usual rapid-fire sagacity. “But who has the library and content and how do they keep it fresh? And you will get some strange things, and there will be those that structurally change. Will movie studios look to go direct to the consumer and bypass the theaters? Those are the questions we ask.”

This wither-the-entertainment-world question is no small potatoes, sideshow matter. Hollywood (writ large) is one of America’s last great businesses. (Software being another.) The United States doesn’t make the most steel or the most ships or the most cars anymore, but we do make the most content. And not only do we make the most, we make the best. Our story-telling, narratives, visual motifs and production values are emulated around the world. And we’re not going to relinquish that leadership position anytime soon. (Yes, I know Hollywood makes a ton of trash. And yes I love foreign films too.)

It’s also the case that entertainment has become vastly more important in our lives. BC (Before Covid), you’d ask someone what they were watching when the conversation flagged. AC, it’s pretty much the third thing you want to know. As in: “Are you and your family OK? How’s work? What are you watching?”

Watching content has become completely core.

Story continues

And so thanks to fortuitous timing, shows like “Tiger King,” the Michael Jordan docuseries “The Last Dance,” and Season 3 of “Ozark” are literally off the charts. Here are the numbers: Some 6.1 million watched the MJ doc, according to ESPN, a record for the network. Netflix’s “Ozark” tripled its viewership so far over Season 2 and according to Indiewire, is “projected…[to] have a viewership of 29 million within its first four weeks.” As for “Tiger King,” Netflix is saying 64 million households chose to watch Joe Exotic et al. (That’s a global number, but just for a point of reference there are 128 million households in the U.S.)

That’s an insane amount of eyeballs. A man looks at a mural depicting Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as ""Joe Exotic,"" in Dallas, Friday, April 10, 2020. The Netflix series ""Tiger King,"" has become popular watching during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maldonado-Passage was convicted in an unsuccessful murder-for-hire plot. (AP Photo/LM Otero)

And guess which company’s benefiting?

“The best positioned is Netflix,” says Deana Myers, research director at media & communications for S&P Global Intelligence. “They spend a lot on fresh content and have a vast library of acquisitions or older content. The company has so much in production and can hold out for the longest period. For another six months they could have significant fresh content.”

In case you missed it, Netflix reported beyond-boffo growth this week, adding 15.8 million new subscribers in the first quarter, more than double the expectation. The question now is how do CEO Reed Hastings and chief content officer Ted Sarandos proceed?

You can’t just flip a switch to make a show. These babies typically take many months to make, (especially since Netflix typically releases its shows in one fell swoop.) Take “Ozark” for instance. There was a 13-month gap between Season 1 and Season 2, and a 19-month gap between 2 and 3. Season 4 hasn't even been greenlit (though it almost certainly will), so we’re talking a release date of late 2021 or 2022 even.

Neflix gave details in its just released letter to shareholders:  “...we’ve paused most of our productions across the world. No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production.”

But the release continued, “In Q2, there is only a modest impact on our new releases…we are working hard to complete the content we know our members want and we’re complementing this effort with additional licensed films and series.” And: “Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content.”

If Netflix is in the catbird seat, relatively speaking, who’s not?

Myers has concerns about traditional TV. “Streaming services in general are in a better position than broadcast or cable networks, which rely on sports programming — that’s a tough position. [And they] don’t have vast [amounts of] new programming. There wasn’t a lot teed up right now.” BTW, Netflix never getting into sports looks pretty smart—or lucky—right now.

Adds Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at TV[R]EV, author of “Over The Top: How The Internet Is (Slowly But Surely) Changing The Television Industry”: “If the economy goes really bad we think cord cutting will pick up tremendously. People will say I don’t have $50 to $100 to spend on stuff I hardly watch, versus pay $40 and have four services.”

Now let’s turn to some streaming upstarts, where the jury is out.

-Take Quibi. The new mobile-only streaming app launched on April 6 is off to a respectable enough start with 2.7 million downloads. “Quibi is building nicely,” chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg told me. “Especially given how crazy the environment is that we’re all living with. Quibi will not have a content delivery issue. We are fully supplied into November.” Myers though wonders if that will be enough.

-NBC’s Peacock, which did a limited rollout on April 15, goes full bore on July 15, but without the Olympics which was to give it a boost. That might end up being a blessing though. “About a year from now, we may get a content drought,” says Wolk. “That could work to Peacock’s advantage if the Olympics go on, and people would be tuning into that.”

-What about Disney+? “They’re in a tougher position. They have a lot in production,” says Myers. “But they’re not going to be able to finish a lot and air it.” On the other hand, Myers says, Disney will benefit from its strong line-up of kids’ programming, as Myers notes, “children will watch the same video 800 times.”

-Apple TV+? “The service that might get hurt I think is Apple, in terms of nobody will subscribe,” says Wolk. “They don’t have a deep library.” Wolk worries value-conscious consumers will balk.

‘Creative people are, well, going to be creative’

As for TV and movie producers who actually create the content, work has become a risky business. “We backed up all of our footage on drives and did a massive move of equipment to the editors’ and assistants’ homes,” says Daphne Pinkerson, producer at Blowback Productions, which has made a number of award-winning documentaries for HBO. “We had two films in The Tribeca Film Festival so it was pretty crushing when it was canceled. One was our Quibi series, “I Promise,” on the new school started by LeBron James and the other was an HBO film on Stockton, Calif.’s millennial mayor, Michael Tubbs.

“If we are not able to start new films soon because of social distancing, we are not going to survive,” she says. “Either that, or all our characters will have masks on. Maybe we can create transparent masks so we can see their lips move!”

Actually there are a few forms of media-making that continue unabated. If you’re a kid—or a fan of that, to my mind, awkward category of grown-up animation (“The Simpsons,” “South Park,” “Family Guy,” etc.) —good news, your game is still on. That’s not lost on Netflix which noted in its shareholder letter that “within two weeks of the shelter-in-place orders coming into effect in Los Angeles, most of our animation production team was back up and running, working from home.” Wolk thinks you may see even more animation coming out of Netflix. Disney too. The Simpsons: (l-r) Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Marge and Homer with dog, ""Santa's Little Helper"", photo

Another category going full tilt is audio books. “Because we’re a virtual, digital platform we're in good shape,” Audible founder and executive chairman Don Katz told Yahoo Finance. “TV shows are being canceled, and movies and Broadway are closed down. We have a network of individual studios and actors and a lot of famous people who know how to do this at home. We're trying to put a lot of people to work.”

Even with most of the entertainment business closed, creative people are, well, going to be creative. “People will start rolling out things that can be produced,” says Wolk. “Hollywood is putting minds together, maybe people will double or triple down on animated series and documentaries, things that don’t require a cast. We may even see, I don't know how feasible it is, innovations with computer generated actors.” And who knows, something like John Krasinski’s at home show, “Some Good News” which gets some 10 million views, might have staying power.

Remember too, what Gabelli alluded to. You are likely going to see mergers and deals. Some big ones probably. (Think at the Apple, Disney, Netflix level.)

But here’s the rub for all of you at home (ha.) Given the crazy number of TV shows and movies made over the past decade, there is no way anyone is going to run out of things to watch. Good things too.

Netflix alone released more than one new show or movie a day (270) in 2019, according to an analysis by Variety, more than the entire industry created in 2005. Bet you haven’t seen 10% of it. (BTW, ‘South Park” parodied all that content creation in an amusing send up: “Netflix. You’re greenlit. Whom am I speaking with?” SNL did a similar bit.)

Look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to catch up, an opportunity we hope to never see again. So go ahead and run through all those best streaming show lists. (I’ve seen only five on this one.) There’re a million shows out there. Seen “Giri/Haji?” Or “Stisel?” Or “Babylon Berlin?” Good stuff there.

Sometime in 2021 you may have had your fill and by then, with any luck, we will be back to some kind of normal. And soon enough, new shows will be on the way!

Video Transcript

JEN ROGERS: We're just about 20 seconds away from the closing bell on this Friday, where we are pushing toward session highs here. Our biggest decline here though in the red on the Dow, that Boeing. Only three names, though, [INAUDIBLE].

[BELL]

That's going to do it for us. So on the Dow, again, Boeing the laggard. Home Depot to the upside here, tacking on almost 5%. A lot of green here. As Jared Blikre has noted earlier, this is the fourth Friday afternoon where we've seen sort of this late day surge here in trading. Again, also like to note that we have the Russell here outperforming. Also, hey, check out crude. Check out oil. It's not negative. Remember Monday and Tuesday, what a wild ride we've been on with the commodity?

A lot of the names that we have watched this week, including Netflix, a stay-at-home play, that's off. We've also got Zoom off here today, Facebook coming out, announcing a Messenger Room, where you can go and talk to about 50 people, that hitting Zoom stock this afternoon, after Zoom had been up on news that it's going to be added to the NASDAQ 100 come April 30th.

I want to bring in my co-host Myles Udland and take us back to an old name, Beyond Meat, Myles. Have you seen it lately? It's up, like, 40% since this week. So we talk about that, look, we had that rally for two weeks. And now we are definitely in a different phase, right? It seems that whether this is consolidation, this is a breather, this is a pause, this week felt a little bit different than the last two.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. I sort of wonder, were the last two weeks trying to fake us out of this still being the same phase if we want to kind of talk about it in those sorts of time frames. I mean, the crisis period only kicked off late, late February. We started to see markets down 2% or 3% in a single session, which was kind of a shocker, given what we had become used to in late '19 into early '20.

Story continues

And so I think some of the visceral reaction we saw from investors the last two weeks say, how can the market go up this quickly? Perhaps those folks were vindicated a bit this week because while things seemed tamer on today's close and we've got a VIX weekly close under 40 for the first time in a while, I mean, negative oil prices are a reminder that this market is still pretty much broken.

And so I don't know what the next catalyst is going to be. I think we've got a lot of big cap tech earnings next week that could move the market. They might not, but they are decent candidates to be market movers. But I think after we got off that ultimate low, what did consensus become? Consensus was we're going to retest that low.

Well, we haven't done that yet. But I think this week, for all of its seeming calmness that still, when you look at those shorted names or Beyond Meat's, there's still a lot of stuff in this market that is pretty fundamentally broken. And I think investors would be wise to respect the market on that basis. It can go up or down, but it's not a healthy situation by any means.

You know, and it wasn't the last two weeks, but the price of-- the oil action this week was a more firm reminder of just how dangerous this situation is right now.

JEN ROGERS: And in this time frame that we're in, we're also in earnings season. Our parent company is Verizon. Julie Hyman did an interview with the CEO Hans Vestberg earlier today about those results.

HANS VESTBERG: [INAUDIBLE] revenues is coming down, and of course, small and medium businesses are investing far less at this moment. The hardware business, as I said, is coming down, as people are trading much less. The switcher pool is less. So there are a couple of factors that is making it up.

And what we have said that we want to continue with the guidance on EPS, even though the range is a little bit broader, and we also said that we're assuming that it's going to be sort of a fairly normal basis in the second half of 2020. That's an assumption we don't know, but we thought it would better for our shareholders to get our transparency on how we see the situation right now. That's why we kept our guidance.

JEN ROGERS: So I think what's really interesting about Verizon's earnings and what we can take away from it to look at other companies is that Verizon, your phone is something you need, Rick Newman.

And Verizon even lost subscribers in Q1, as we saw this shift. And we talked about this a lot with Netflix this week-- Netflix, by the way, the only thing that's down today-- people trying to figure out, like, the changes that we're seeing right now in this crisis, something that's going to stick around and how we kind of figure that out for all these different companies.

RICK NEWMAN: As I'm trying to puzzle through this, I just don't think you can even make much out of what happened in these first quarter earnings results. Remember, we're talk-- we're basically talking about two to three weeks at the end of March, which is just a portion of the first quarter. And this is before many people actually began to feel the pain this is causing, or they started to get a sense of it.

But the second quarter is the one that's going to be off the charts. So are people going to actually start to cancel Netflix to save 13 or 15 bucks a month? Are they going to actually start to cancel their cell phone subscriptions or extra features they have on those subscriptions, which is what the Verizon earnings suggest?

I have no idea, but people are going to be in much worse shape at the end of the second quarter than they were at the end of the first. And that's when we're going to get a lot of the holy crap moments in earnings.

JEN ROGERS: I mean, I frankly thought the Discover Card call where the CEO came out and just talked about how far we've seen sales falling, if you go everyday, sales were down 14% year over year. Travel, I mean, was down 99%. You might expect that.

But to Rick's point-- and we've been talking about this here, is, how do we take this data, whether it's economic data that might be backward looking, whether it's this earnings data, and we're trying to get a picture of where we're heading.

So here, on a Friday, when we can look back at what we've traced this week, I mean, how do you think about some of these numbers that we've gotten from companies so far?

AKIKO FUJITA: Well, I think to Rick's point, I mean, the thinking is that it's going to get worse before it gets better, right? Everything we have heard over the last month, let's say, has been about the bounceback that we're likely to get in the second half. And increasingly, we're hearing, well, maybe that's not in the third quarter, but maybe that is in the fourth quarter.

And a lot of that, I know we've repeated this over and over, but a lot of it will have to do with the timeline of the reopening. And we have seen this get pushed back. When you think about even some of these companies that kept their guidance, you know, initially, it was because the expectation was this is only going to be a month and a half to two months.

Well, now we're hearing, potentially in some of the hardest hit cities, maybe not until June, maybe not until July, large gatherings are going to happen until maybe next year. And so as those forecasts get more and more dire, I think that the economic data is going to start to reflect that. And, you know, I think the earnings we've gotten so far, it's only just a few weeks into this. The second quarter is really, we're going to see the most realistic impact of all of this.

RICK NEWMAN: Think about consumer psychology as we're going through this. So many of the job losses we've seen so far, those are supposedly temporary furloughs. But we don't know if they're temporary. I mean, we hope they're temporary. But, you know, think about people who've been laid off. And they think, well, I will be going back to work in a couple of months, and in the meanwhile, I've got a $1,200 federal check.

How are they going to feel in two months if they're not back to work yet? I saw an amazing survey today or yesterday that said more than 50% of all workers, you know, once you figure out the numbers, think that their job or their income is in jeopardy in 2020. I mean, that's astonishing. And if that is not-- if this has not gotten better by a couple of months, I mean, we're going to see massive downturns in consumer spending.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-recap-friday-april-24-204038111.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0BYH.DU', '0E7A.DU', '1A86Z.NX', '31A.F', '52EJ04.KO', '6RL.MU', '8B51V.NX', '91USC.NX', 'A50HZ.NX', 'BAC.BE', 'BAC.DU', 'BAC.F', 'BAC.HA', 'BAC.HM', 'BAC.MU', 'BAC.STU', 'BAC.XETRA', 'BRE.MI', 'C9DK.MU', 'CD4PH.NX']",['NETFLIX'],"{'polarity': -0.489, 'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.047}"
151,2020-04-24T20:30:53+00:00,Why coronavirus may accelerate cord-cutting: Survey,"64% of U.S. households may lack interest in cable TV, according to a new survey conducted by The Trade Desk. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal breaks down the impact on Yahoo Finance.

Video Transcript

ZACK GUZMAN: Meantime, I'm not sure if you caught the NFL draft last night, day one of the NFL draft, but things were a little bit different. It looked a lot more like our show here as we're all staying at home trying to flatten the curve. When you look at it, though, it might be impacting the way that Americans are rethinking their cable subscription, as live sports continues to be postponed.

For more on that, I want to get to Alexandra Canal for the latest in our Fame or Fortune segment. And Ale, I mean, a recent survey indicated that things are not looking good for a lot of Americans thinking about sticking with cable.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. So it's no denying that streaming has ballooned amid the coronavirus, and according to a new survey by the Trade Desk, it could be impacting how some people are considering their cable subscriptions moving forward. So according to the survey, 64% of US households have either cut the cord, are planning to cut the cord, or haven't even subscribed to cable.

And if you break that down by age groups, those age 18 to 34, that number jumps to 74%. So if you think about it, only about a quarter of young US adults have any long-term interest in cable. So if you picture that media landscape 5, 10, 15 years from now, it's very possible that cable could become obsolete and the focus could remain on just online and streaming.

To further illustrate that point, of those that have cable, 11% said they plan to cut the cord by the end of this year, that number once again jumping for those age 18 to 34 to 18%. But these trends are only going to continue to accelerate as people remain stuck at home due to the coronavirus, and as you mentioned, live sports remain off the air because that's really important to cable subscribers.

Story continues

For example, 60% of those that were interviewed in this survey said that's the main reason that they even have a cable subscription. So as live sports remain off the air, it's going to convince more people to try out different services like Netflix, like Hulu, like Disney Plus. So it's clear that this pandemic is tilting in the favor of those streaming services.

Just take a look at Netflix's impressive earnings report. They nabbed 16 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2020. And considering a lot of businesses are struggling right now, they're able to capitalize on this moment, and they're doing just fine. And then cable just seems to be a little bit behind the eight ball here.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, I mean, you raise a good point. When we look at those, those record subscriber ads from Netflix's latest quarter, it's still trading near all-time highs.

But when you think about it, they got to feed the beast. We did hear that they had most of their content in the can, but when it comes to Netflix maintaining that growth, it's going to require a lot of new content to come down the chute if people are chewing through all this content so quickly. So what are they doing on that front to make sure they can keep pace with their already record breaking pace here?

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, they're still feeding the beast. If you remember back in 2018, Netflix and Ryan Murphy signed a massive reported $300 million deal over the next five years. And coming May 1st, Ryan Murphy will be releasing his second project for the platform. It's called ""Hollywood."" And it tells the reimagined story of a much more inclusive 1940s industry.

So they released the trailer earlier this week. It created a lot of buzz on Twitter. I have a little snippet from that that I want to play for you guys. So take a look.

- If you changed the way that movies are made--

- Coffee, Miss Lara?

- --I think you can change the world.

- I want you to be the star.

- Really?

- If you want something, you have to declare it.

- I'll do anything.

- I am not just a star. I am a star maker.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, so you see there's a lot of familiar faces in that trailer, including Darren Criss, who has appeared in multiple Ryan Murphy productions in the past, such as ""Glee"" and ""The Assassination of Gianni Versace."" But what this show illustrates is Netflix's arsenal of content, talent, and resources. They said on Wednesday that they plan to raise an additional $1 billion to fund new programming, as well as acquire new content.

So they're really willing to put their money where their mouth is here. And that's going to help them win this streaming fight. We still have yet to see the emergence of some competitors. We'll see HBO Max make their grand debut in the streaming wars next month. But for now, Netflix is still the leader in this space. And they're still creating a lot of content that people are craving right now.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and at least the surge in subscribers making the cash burn a little bit better than we've come to expect, averaging about three billion a year, now down to just one with the surge in new subscribers.

152,2020-04-24T14:29:46+00:00,"Peloton Attracts a Record 23,000 People to Single Workout Class","(Bloomberg) --

The home-fitness cycling company Peloton Interactive Inc. said it set a record Wednesday for the most people streaming a single live class, with 23,000 participating.

The coronavirus pandemic has hit gyms and real-world cycling classes hard, but it’s been an opportunity for Peloton to sign up new customers as millions around the globe shelter in place. Just as Netflix Inc. is setting records for video streaming with 182.8 million subscribers, Peloton’s business seems built for a world where people need to work out at home.

Peloton said in a statement Friday that it now has more than 2 million members worldwide. The shares surged more than 6%.

The participation record came as the company’s head instructor streamed from her home. “This is the first time that Peloton has filmed classes outside of its two studios after the temporary suspension of streaming live classes from its studios in New York and London,” the company said.

153,2020-04-24T12:19:04+00:00,What's the Point in Downgrading Italy's Debt?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s like the 2012 euro crisis all over again, as Europe awaits a decision on Italy’s sovereign-debt rating from S&P Global Ratings after Friday’s market close. The country’s current BBB (negative outlook) is just a couple of notches above the junk-bond category, so there’s plenty of investor interest in what happens. Moody’s Investors Service will assess its rating, which is one notch lower, next week.

It doesn’t make much sense that the finances of one of the world’s largest economies are beholden to Delphic judgments from commercial agencies.

It’s unlikely that Italy will be cut to junk. Even if it is, the European Central Bank will keep buying Rome’s debt. But an eventual loss of the country’s investment-grade rating would matter. Many bond funds would have to sell Italian sovereign debt and other related credits. It could cause financial distress to the nation’s finances, and to the European Union.

Surely we need a more realistic, and more flexible, rating system to avoid a credit shock during the Covid-19 crisis — which is no individual country’s fault.

Both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank appreciate the dilemma and are making efforts to either purchase higher-quality junk-rated debt, or to accept it as collateral, but we need to change the way we rigorously evaluate credit risk. What’s the point of creating “fallen angels” — the name given to bonds that have dropped below investment grade since the pandemic struck — if the world’s biggest bond buyers then have to implement special measures to ignore the downgrades?

S&P downgraded six times more companies in the first quarter of 2020 than it upgraded. Moody’s has taken negative rating action against nearly a quarter of the companies it classifies as speculative grade, largely because of the coronavirus. It expects the gap in creditworthiness between junk and investment grade to widen. This deluge needs to be managed before it overwhelms even the best efforts of the world’s central bankers.

Story continues

Credit ratings are too blunt an instrument right now, given the vast — and necessary — escalation of debt. The requirement of investment-grade bond indexes to only allow specifically rated bonds is an accident waiting to happen. A wave of more downgrades is coming.

The agencies could help by adopting new methodologies to make it less binary for bond indexes and fixed-income funds when credit is downgraded. With so much debt being reclassified downward, we need a system that considers creditworthiness relative to other sovereigns and corporates, rather than looking at individual cases in an absolute way as we do now.

With half of America’s investment-grade companies sitting in the BBB bucket (just above the junk divide) and more than 200 billion euros ($216 billion) of European credits close to the edge, there’s an overwhelming need to address this anomaly.

The penalty for falling on the wrong side of the divide is too severe. It has a sizable effect on credit spreads (the difference between a bond’s yield and that of its benchmark), with a one-notch downgrade often being punitive. The average spread between junk BB-rated European credits and investment grade BBB stuff blew out to almost 400 basis points from an average of about 100 basis points at one point during this crisis.

The credit markets themselves function pretty well in determining how a bond should be valued. Netflix Inc., for example, managed to achieve its lowest-ever yield Thursday for a $1 billion debt sale despite only having a relatively lowly BB- junk rating. That makes sense for a company whose business model is suited to people staying at home. Investor demand was more than 10 times what was on offer. On the flip side of the coin, Carnival Corp., the ailing cruises company, had to pay nearly 12% to raise funds in March despite being technically still investment grade. Investors know how to price this debt.

In fairness, the ratings agencies can’t provide real-time credit validation when they rely on actual data rather than presumption. But they need to adapt to the changing reality of Covid-19 — and quickly.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: We are joined now by Mario Gabelli. He is the Chairman and CEO of GAMCO Investors. Mario, great to talk to you. Thanks for joining today. Let's just start right now with how you are thinking about this environment, how you are trying to sift through all the mess we've seen in the market and the uncertainty of the economy to find attractive or interesting areas.

MARIO GABELLI: Yeah that's a great question, great way to start. You know, back in February I was out in Las Vegas on the middle of, last week of February. And at that time, everybody was worried about the supply-- but we-- shortages and supply chain disruptions that we had. Obviously, what happened in South Korea and Italy. And then we became very aware that it was the consumer that was going to get hit.

And we have a health challenge, and the markets, in the last week of March, had all the stress testing you wanted, all the algos, ETFs. And you just had somebody on on the oil patch, and obviously negative oil was just an example of what happens when you have leveraged ETF's that people had to unwind. And lots of interesting disruptions from mechanical trading.

But the Fed went into what I call hypersonic. Like a mach five, as opposed to a mach one, in terms of putting money in the system. Fiscal policy is catching up. We've got an infrastructure bill likely somewhere in the next horizon. And so you have a lot of pluses. Right now, you're going through the earnings season. I listened to several this morning.

And obviously, lots of earnings releases in the market for some stocks, like Belmont, went up and some had some challenges. Independent of that, we get past the second quarter and then we start thinking about, is there going to be a second wave of COVID-19. But independent of that, what happens in the first half of 2021?

Story continues

So we have always done what we did in the '60s, when I covered conglomerates as an institutional research analyst. What are the leading indicators? What are the coincidental? What are lagging? Which stocks will do well?

At the same time, we have to be realistic. 100 years ago, we had an Industrial Revolution in this country, and today we're seeing the dynamics of a digital revolution. What is going to change? When I order online, am I going to stay with a brand? What's happening to brand identification? How do-- if the consumer spends 2% shift from eating out to eating at home, is this permanent? They stocking their shelves or the pantry, or are they going to start?

And so what companies benefit from that. So those are the dots that we're looking at. And from my point of view, also following cyclical companies, how bad is bad? I've gone through like five auto cycles. Maybe six. How long will it last? And then how good is good and who is going to be the beneficiary of bringing a artificial intelligence, bringing the EB, being better, and shifting everything? Who's going to be the [INAUDIBLE], the entity that goes into the Amazon distribution centers and automates it, and how are they going to put in battery-powered vehicles?

And then we obviously have what I call the bottle stocks. BOTL have had a challenger. The banks, with the stress testing. The oil patch you talked about earlier, no need to echo on that. That's a great beneficiary for consumers in China. Great beneficiary of the US, but bankruptcies will happen to the producers. And we'll work our way through. Then travel and leisure.

Do I want to go back to Las Vegas? When will they open? How will they space the dynamics there? What happens to convention center hotels? What happens to the whole infrastructure? Will I get into an Uber without, you know, worrying about who was there before? Will I do Airbnb?

So you do have lots of the dots.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

MARIO GABELLI: And that's what we look at every day.

ANDY SERWER: Hey, Mario. Andy Serwer here. Sorry to jump in. I just want to ask you about streaming, entertainment, TV, Hollywood, because you are the media maestro investor of all time. And here's the thing. You know, we were talking about peak content just a couple of months ago. And now, are we going to be looking at trough content going into 2020-21 because there's no production going on. Are we going to run out of content?

MARIO GABELLI: Well you have a lot of stuff that was put in the pipeline, like classic films that would have been enormous box office successes. You know, Tom Cruise had one. Some of the Disney movies, they've all been pushed forward. I just talked to a movie theater operator today, and you know, how are they going to position themselves? They have an ability to space everyone six seats apart. And how much of that is going to come back?

In China, which is 40-- the US box office, Andy, was $42 billion last year. $10 billion in China. They just shut the theaters down. Now that's going to come back, slowly. I mean, we have an office in Shanghai, we have an office in Hong Kong, and they give us an update of traffic patterns and what people are doing.

So there will be a gap in creative content. Netflix mentioned that. Anybody reading the Hollywood Reporter, Variety knows that, and that's a reality of the dynamics that we're facing. Independent of that, who's got the library, and who's got some content, and how do they keep it fresh? Will Sony, which has a great music, what are they going to do with their film entertainment business?

Will they now look to, find Tencent to do something with? Will they do something with Alibaba? Will they do something with the companies in China? Or will they do something with the companies up in Seattle? Will Amazon say, hey, listen, let's do a deal where we put it together with Paramount?

You saw that in streaming, in the music world today. John Malone and Greg Maffei put together a transaction, which is classic you know, quilting together their Formula One entity and shifting Live Nation over to Liberty Sirius. Liberty Sirius is also-- has great care-- own Liberty-- they own Sirius. They're trying to figure out what they do with Pandora.

So streaming music is up sharply. That helps companies like Vivendi, where they sold 10% of it to Tencent for a very interesting market cap. Will Sony do something like that?

Independent of that, clearly there will be those that structurally change. Will direct to the consumer of a theater bypass the window and not go to the theaters? Or will they have to open box office? Those are the questions we will ask. On the advertising front for television, if you're a TV station, the local, 70% or 80% of your revenues were derived from local.

No car sales? At 40% to 50% or 60% down, what we thought with Bloomberg and Steyer would carry through the year, I still think you'll have significant political in the second half of the year. And that's a plus. I think car sales have come, not roaring back, but come back. And they've start advertising again.

So the local advertisers, unfortunately, they are cash to-- the debt-to-EBITDA has gone for 4 times to 8 times, since that's high leverage, but they've got huge cash flow coming up in the next six months. So we're trying to figure out which ones we want to own, which ones we'll consolidate, which will be part of a consolidation process.

And the same thing with regards to Spectrum. The FCC is going to have a new Spectrum auction with the T-Mobile Sprint deal being done. What does that mean? So those are the kind of dots in the environment of the film entertainment. Then you get some strange things. You've got the WWE, World Wide Wrestling was considered essential in Florida, so they're opening up. Tonight you've got the football draft. That's going to be quite entertaining.

Then you've got Tiger Woods doing a foursome of golf carts apart. And so we've got to bring it back. So one of the stocks I like is baseball. I still like the Atlanta Braves. The stock is selling at $17.18. And with a 60 million shares, you're talking about a billion market cap, a real estate's worth of debt. And can I buy a baseball team? Yeah I want you to buy it for your granddaughter. I want you to buy it for a grandson. You can buy a Madison Square Garden, which went through financial engineering today.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah. Well, Mario, let's talk a little bit about, let's talk a little bit about MSU. Last time you and I spoke, a year ago, I think, I outlined some MSG case. You told me I had it all backwards. We were waiting for Zion Williamson to arrive in town. When you look at a company like that, and some of these live assets, you know, where you're looking at a building, how can companies try to outline what the next 18 months might look like? I mean, when are the fans going to be in the building, when are you gonna be able to have a concert? These sorts of things.

MARIO GABELLI: Well, a concert is something different. I think that there is a great deal of interest in tribal relationships, sports in particular. You know, the concert streaming does help those that don't copyright and own content. Even with the modern music act, the helping out the way the fees are calculated and collected. But basically, you go back to question, will the baseball season start? Will they have an opening day in one location? Will everybody play? Will basketball play in Phoenix, as they're talking about and have all the teams there, all the players, and have a finish? Work in progress.

Goes back to one giant step, Andy. Testing. OK? How do we ramp up testing? How do we increase the capacity for a second wave? How do we prepare? Every drug company we talk about, in terms of testing, has gone up 20%, 30%, 40%. One [INAUDIBLE] has gone from like, 60 to 120-- 125.

The digital world is-- Teledoc-- has gone from 75 to 170. So you have a lot of these dynamics occurring, and you know, what price do I want to pay and what valuations do I want to get. And even this morning, you had the BlackRock talk about financial engineering, and how they're seeing significant opportunities. And then you'll have structural changes. JC Penney's gone bust. Lord and Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and what happens to shopping centers? What happens to commercial buildings?

MELODY HAHM: Yeah, Melody Hahm here. When you think about the leadership that you're hearing from as you tune into these earnings calls, with so much murky guidance ahead, we've seen a lot of crisis-management leadership, right? Whether it's the Bob Iger's of the world choosing to come back. We saw that New York Times piece on Bezos really stepping back up to that CEO role, and living into that title. What leaders are you really looking towards, and effective leadership strategies?

MARIO GABELLI: Well that's totally different. I was down in Florida visiting with Nextera Energy. They're clearly one of the leaders through an entity that I like called, the National Energy Partners, NEP, which is their play on wind and solar. As an example, Madison Gas and Electric has a wind farm going up. Google's taking their wind because they are still sensitive to climate change.

And as a result of that, which companies have that kind of a skill set? Offshore wind, offshore solar, battery technology for storage, and obviously transmission. And how do we protect transmission from cyber security? Those are still the dots that we connect.

And so that's why I like Avangrid at $44, $45, it's $310 billion shares, of which $250 million are owned by Iberdrola, which is one of the leaders on the global basis. And then in terms of leadership, Valmont, as an example-- a couple of you wouldn't know much-- but they're in a variety of businesses. They gave you the dots.

So analysts can do and connect. They don't want earnings guidance. I want the dots. How much is CapEx, what's your effective tax rate, what's your cash tax rate, what's going on. And then we worry about next year when somebody has to pay the bills, and the Fed holds off from putting incremental money into what happens to T-bills, what happens to commercial paper, what happens to money markets, and financing.

MYLES UDLAND: All right. Mario Gabelli, always great to get your thoughts. Mario Gabelli, of course, the Chairman and CEO of GAMCO Investors. Thank you so much for taking the time today. Hopefully we can talk to you soon.

ANDY SERWER: Hey, Mario, Andy Serwer here. I want-- sorry to jump in. I just want to ask you about streaming entertainment, TV, Hollywood because you are the media maestro investor of all time. But here's the thing.

Independent of that, who's got the library? And who's got some content? And how do they keep it fresh? Well, Sony, which has a great music-- what are they going to do with their film entertainment business?

157,2020-04-23T17:27:59+00:00,Investors think the coronavirus has put the US economy into another Great Depression: strategist,"It’s always next to impossible to pinpoint precisely what the stock market has priced into valuations. Although right now, equities strategists would universally agree the market has factored in two quarters of outright economic ugliness in the United States at the hands of the deadly coronavirus.

The wild cards sitting here today is how the market will react to finally receiving the economic dread it has come to expect since the health pandemic erupted in early March. And then, has the market bounced too hard from the March lows on the expectation of V-shaped economic recovery later this year that may not appear, given the realities of a post pandemic world?

“I think the expectation of market participants is that we’re in the Great Depression and that in a sense, the news can’t get much worse,” said BNY Mellon chief strategist Alicia Levine on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

To Levine’s point, it’s interesting to see the market continue to rally in the face of brutal reads on the U.S. economy. It only fuels the thesis that the bottom in the markets formed on March 23, which may be a flawed view. The latest upbeat market response arrived on Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 300 points in the face of news that another 4.427 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. A Salvation Army relief worker tends to a line at a local soup kitchen during the Great Depression. Nearly a century later, the U.S. economy is all but shut down, and layoffs are soaring at small businesses and major industries. A devastating global recession looks inevitable. Deepening the threat, a global oil price war has erupted. Some economists foresee an economic downturn to rival the Depression. (AP Photo)

Since mid-March, 26 million more people have applied for jobless benefits. This would mean an unemployment rate of 20.6%, per math from MUFG chief economist Chis Rupkey, who points out the rate is closing in on Great Depression levels where a quarter of all jobs are lost.

“It is going to take years not months to put these pandemic jobless workers back to work at the shops and malls and factories and restaurants across the country. What are stock market investors thinking? There's at least 33 million people out of work in the country. Investors should be running for their lives,” Rupkey contends.

Rupkey notes the stock market fell 57.7% at the worst point of the Great Depression. The S&P 500 was only down 13.3% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close of trading.

‘I would be hedging myself’

Moreover, big cap tech stocks such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Netflix continue to trade as if this was the 2019 economy, not one where a quarter of jobs in America have vanished within two months. The Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 ratio has climbed back to 2000 dot com bubble highs, points out researchers at SunDial Capital.

At some point soon, the market could be forced into pulling off its rose-colored glasses. Sure, extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve is a major backstop to equities as history has proven again and again. But for investors to completely ignore jarring information on the economy seems absurd.

“I would be hedging myself in this marketplace. There is still a lot of uncertainty, there is an outstanding number of people that are not working right now,” says Advisorshares CEO Noah Hamman. “I’m optimistic that the economy is going to turn around. But it doesn’t mean that the stock market is going to follow along with it.”

Sounds like reasonable insight inside of a Great Depression.

Noah Hamman, AdvisorShares CEO joins Yahoo Finance to discuss.

Video Transcript

BRIAN SOZZI: Let's stay on the markets here with Noah Hamman, CEO of Advisor Shares. Noah, always good to see you. Give us some positive news. Give us a good trade to be making in this-- not us, but viewers-- a good trade to making this environment. The initial jobless claims data wasn't good, had new home sales data just hitting tape. That's not good either. What should investors be gravitating to?

NOAH HAMMAN: I think probably getting hedged. It's the same message from last time. I know it's probably not the news that people want to hear, but I would be hedging myself in this marketplace. There's still a lot of uncertainty. There's an outstanding number of people that are not working right now. The number is just a pile-on from the previous numbers. I think the total now is somewhere close to 25 million people out of jobs. And so the numbers aren't great.

You've got to look at something like a HDGE or a DWSH. They're two short equity ETFs that can actually add some performance to your portfolio, probably not today. It looks like the markets are heading up, which is terrific, but I think over the course of this year, they're going to add some value to your portfolio.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: But Noah, you actually point out that it's really important for investors to be careful they're using the right ETF to hedge their portfolio. What's the criteria here in this environment for the right ETF?

NOAH HAMMAN: It's just understanding what the ETF does, right? So we've seen the news this week with the USO ETF and people kind of understanding that hey, this isn't following the price of oil. It's following the price of this futures contract that then that, in and of itself, went sort of crazy. And we run into the same thing, having alternative investment strategies in our lineup, like the two products I mentioned that are short equity strategies, there are some products out there that are called inverse funds. They're passively managed.

Story continues

They just provide the inverse of an index, but they only do it for a day. And so the product sponsors are great about articulating that, but investors, you know, similar to probably what we saw with the USO ETF, don't maybe always understand what that means. And so if you are hedging over a market cycle because you think it's going to be bad for a while, you want to be careful of those products.

And just as an example with some numbers, the inverse-- single-data inverse, passively managed ETF with the ticker symbol SH, I believe is up-- let me look at the numbers-- 8.37. And this is as of-- this is year-to-date through April 21, but the market's down 13%. Some investors-- not all-- think that that fund should be up 13%, and it's not. And it's because of its daily investment objective.

So short funds like DWSH or Hedge, for example, over the same time frame are up upwards of-- I think HDGE is up 23.18%, and DWSH is up 35% just this year to date. So understanding the difference, if you're the type of investor to HDGE, and you always want to be careful and know what you're investing in, but understanding those differences are critical.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, just a quick follow-up, March new home sales down 15.4% month over month, just stunning data we continue to get from the US economy. Noah, what is-- we're in the eye of a storm of earnings season. What are some of your takeaways so far?

NOAH HAMMAN: Well, the target numbers were incredibly impressive this morning, right? In some ways, not surprising as we think about who's benefiting and what companies and sectors are benefiting in this environment. But I think, you know, more pain for longer, unfortunately, between the unemployment numbers, not surprising to see lower housing start numbers.

You know, maybe there's some value to be found in the energy space, even though we're mostly short some of those equity positions. But maybe there's some opportunities there as things start to turn around a little bit. And I think that's the important thing. I'm so optimistic that the economy is going to turn around. It doesn't actually mean that the stock market's going to follow along with it.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: And Noah, you know, I just want to bring to your attention and to our viewers' attention to the latest economic report showing a record drop in business activity, and according to IHS Markit. And this, of course, is consistent with figures we're seeing come out of Germany and Japan, Australia indicating a worldwide recession. For those who don't want to play in equities right now, US or otherwise, where should they put their money, or do they just sit on some cash at the moment?

NOAH HAMMAN: I would go cash. Or I think that one of the things we talked about last time, which I think is still a good position, which is probably a longer maturity treasuries. I don't think interest rates are going to be heading up anytime soon. And in fact, there still could be more downward pressure. You want to be in a safe type of investment, treasuries are there. But given where I think interest rates might be going, you can actually see some total return or some capital appreciation with that allocation.

And it's not, you know, sell everything and forget about it, right? There is a portion of my portfolio that is for the very, very long term, for my retirement, which is hopefully out in the future sometime, but that I'm not getting too aggressive on. I'm still dollar-cost averaging. But if you have the ability to protect yourself and/or you're looking for places to put new money today, you want to be defensive. Either get hedged or look at cash or look at longer-- long-- longer-term dated treasuries.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, no retiring yet, Noah. We still need your market insights. Don't leave us so quickly, all right?

NOAH HAMMAN: Thank you, I appreciate it.

BRIAN SOZZI: How do you play-- you're the ETF master here. How do you play rising bankruptcies in the US? I'm worried about retail. I'm worried about a lot of industrial companies, also worried a lot about US-focused small businesses.

NOAH HAMMAN: Right, it's a tough one. I think, you know, shorting is the way to do it. Getting out of the way with cash is the way to do it. There's actually not a lot of investment options in terms of, say, inverse credit. Those are very difficult products to build because in the times where things are good, the decay, with the interest payments, can make those products very challenging. So I think you're only places to go, you know, are probably-- well, and big blue chips, right? Hang out there.

The target numbers, I would look at that. When I think things are going to start to turn, it'll bring the blue chips back up. And like we saw early in the cycle where the smaller caps and the micro-caps were the first to indicate there's problems ahead, they'll be the last then to turn. So I would just stay in high-quality equities. If I have to be in the market, I would go to cash, treasuries. Or if you're comfortable, shorting the market can provide some positive returns, maybe in a small allocation in your portfolio.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Noah, we talked before about the energy sector, not doing what it's doing right now, I mean, an unprecedented cratering for the oil markets. But I know you don't have a lot of exposure in that space, but what do you have right now, and are you holding it, given this unprecedented drop in oil prices?

NOAH HAMMAN: Sure, so I think Chevron is the name that I just saw come up in the double-line equity. It's a value ETF strategy. They have a small allocation to energy. They're under weighted compared to their benchmark of the Russell 1000 value, but they are picking and choosing some companies in there that they think could be the beneficiary of a change in those oil prices.

So-- and I think that's, in general, where we are. And I'm biased when I say this because all of our strategies are actively managed, but this really should be the environment for active managers to shine. You can find those opportunities even in a tough sector like energy. You just got to be stock selective and have some very good insight in those companies.

BRIAN SOZZI: Noah, one thing that has caught my attention, I got a note from one of my friends this morning, the NASDAQ 100 to S&P 500 ratio is at its highest level since 2000, the dot-com bubble. Are we seeing some kind of bubble in tech stocks, and does that surprise you?

NOAH HAMMAN: Well, you're definitely seeing them being a bit more defensive in this market. It probably doesn't surprise me, you know, no different than seeing online sales for Target go up dramatically. You're seeing some of the numbers you saw from Netflix the other day. It feels like in this, you know, current, not fair to say post-pandemic world yet, I think the tech companies are going to do well.

Look at what's happened with Zoom stock, and look at the aggressive moves that Microsoft with Teams and even Google is making with their own Meeting software, seeing that this isn't going to probably slow down any time soon. So I don't-- you know, it's-- they haven't tracked or declined as much as the regular-- the rest of the equity space.

But I don't know that I would call the tech space a bubble just yet. I mean, overall market decline, sure, but I think they're going to weather it probably better than others, certainly the retailing and consumer cyclical space, things like that that are I think absolutely going to underperform the rest of the year.

BRIAN SOZZI: All right, let's leave it there, Noah Hamman, CEO of Adviser Shares. I will reiterate, no retiring.

160,2020-04-22T20:10:24+00:00,"Wall Street bullish on Netflix following Q1 results, but concerns linger","A slew of Wall Street analysts reacted to Netflix’s first quarter results, with most still bullish on the stock. As of Tuesday, it had a consensus rating of 29 buys, 8 holds, 6 sells, with an average price target of $428.07, although a few analysts expressed concerns over a strong dollar, retention and pricing.

Video Transcript

MYLES UDLAND: Let's take a look at shares of Netflix right now. That stock is off right around 2 and 1/2% following its latest quarterly report published last night. And let's take a look in our Call of the Day at two separate notes on the stock. We've got Piper Sandler raising their price target to $500 per share, maintaining an overweight rating. Meanwhile, Stifel lowering their outlook for the stock, decreasing their rating to hold from a buy.

So, Dan Roberts, last night, we saw Netflix essentially, you know, post double the number of subscriber gains that the company had-- that Wall Street had forecasted, and I think the debate here kind of splits pretty cleanly along two lines. One, this is great for Netflix, everyone's watching it. Or two, they're pulling forward any demand that they were going to enjoy kind of smoothly over-- over the years to come.

DAN ROBERTS: Yeah, I'm with Piper on this debate, Myles, because, you know, the pull forward argument is one that we just discussed Monday of this week on this show about Peloton, the fear that, oh, times look good right now, but we're worried about the back half of the year and-- and once we emerge from coronavirus. I understand the thinking of, you know, wanting to see that the company is putting its house in order for when we get through this. But again-- and I said this about Peloton-- it's a good problem to have.

I mean, there are companies that are struggling right now and will thus be struggling also when this time ends. And so in contrast with those, it seems to me pretty good news if you are seeing a lot of additions right now. I know that, you know, there was an-- an Ever quarter note that said this is probably peak net additions, to bring in a third analyst note into our discussion. This is probably going to be, you know, peak Netflix net additions in a quarter, and it's anyone's guess. I think that's kind of a big call to make.

Story continues

You know, more anecdotally, I would also add, on this show we've talked often about the idea that, you know, as more and more competition comes around and other great original shows are going to be on other platforms, is Netflix really as dominant a king in the next year or two? Is it going to still kind of wear the crown? And anecdotally, I think yes, and it's because of the kitchen sink. I mean, I'll use myself as an example. Just last night, we were on Netflix and we were looking at the home page, and I saw the show ""Waco,"" which I know you watched when it was a Paramount exclusive, with Taylor Kitsch from ""Friday Night Lights.""

And I remember wanting to watch that show, but not having the Paramount service. Well, lo and behold, it has made its way to Netflix, which is always a nice thing to see. I mean, the-- the platform is always getting more content. And I also saw on my homepage recommend to me that ""Wild, Wild Country"" documentary, which I remember people buzzing about months and months ago, and I didn't watch it at the time. And I thought, oh, another thing for me to add to my watchlist.

My point being, you know, people say, well, now that I've seen ""Ozark"" and I've done ""Stranger Things"" and I've done ""Breaking Bad,"" and I don't know if there's so much that's exciting and new on Netflix. It doesn't need to be all new shows. It's always adding stuff, and there's always stuff to discover on there. And I just think-- I have a hard time believing that all the people who've newly added Netflix during coronavirus will cut it when the economy reopens.

MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, Jen, let me tell you, I mean, you know, cults and David Koresh, that is the kind of pandemic viewing that I know I'm interested in.

JEN ROGERS: Yeah, I mean, look, I don't want to be too flip, but let's get to the Stifle note. If you were a Hollywood writer and you needed to write the perfect scenario for a streaming company to do well, this is it. This is, the-- the note from Stifle, as good as it gets. We're all trapped in our homes, OK? And they still have-- do not have free cash flow. They adjusted their guidance for free cash flow to be a billion. That's better than they're-- expected, but it's because they've halted production. I mean, they still are not free cash flow positive. And what could be better than having everybody trapped in your house?

MELODY HAHM: Yeah, and just to that point, Jen, I-- I do want to note that Reed Hastings mentioned yesterday that production has actually resumed in South Korea and Iceland, with plans to reopen certain projects around the world. And then on that advertising side of things, when we think about all the other platforms where there's the premium service or the free service or the in-betweens that offer minimal ads, I think we've-- we've talked to a lot of analysts and we've heard a lot of chatter, right, leading up into the pandemic that Netflix needs to add that model, needs to offer multiple tiers in order to gain more revenue.

But I think this is one of those instances where they're so well-positioned, regardless of the shrinking budgets of every single company around the world to invest in marketing and ad spend, Netflix is fine, right? And they have so much backlog of a lot of content. And to Dan's point, they have so many licensing deals in the works that the likes of Quibi and even Disney have not been necessarily able to forge. So yeah, being an incumbent in this space definitely helps during this time.

MYLES UDLAND: But to that point, Melody, I saw that-- that commentary from Netflix, and I was-- I'm a little skeptical that their production schedule is totally fine. And-- and I think that they-- they maybe can paper over some of that because of the backlog that we've discussed. Whereas, you know, Disney puts a movie in the theaters, it either moves the theater window or it doesn't. I feel like Netflix is going to be able to say that nothing changed when really things probably did.

MELODY HAHM: Yeah, and we know that just by that $100 million fund that they created to help their own employees, to help the entertainment industry here in LA as well. But I think in terms of positioning among all of its counterparts, there certainly is that expediency or that ability to short circuit some of the lag time perhaps that a brand new player was-- would necessarily be facing right now.

JEN ROGERS: And just real quick on the Stifle note, since they were the bear case, I mean, Netflix is a great business. Even-- even they like it, they like it at 300. That's it.

MYLES UDLAND: Right. Stock was at a record high last night briefly, so you have to like it a lot, I guess. We'll leave it-- we'll leave it with that.

ZACK GUZMAN: And I don't want to end our discussion with you, since it's been so long since we chatted, on a negative note here.

MARC RANDOLPH: Thank you.

ZACK GUZMAN: I always get yelled at every time we have you on and I don't ask this question, because we are of course, spending a lot of time at home-- in terms of passing the time right now, when it comes to what you're watching as the co-founder of Netflix, who apparently also and Disney Plus, what is it that you're turning to, Marc, during these times?

MARC RANDOLPH: Well, Zack, the thing is, my watching is going way up. And of course, we burned through Tiger King-- of course, spectacular. All right. I'll admit it-- I did watch Love is Blind and thought that was pretty great as well.

We're almost to the season finale of Ozark. But the thing that I'm kind of most amazed at is, I'm finally watching the show which is the most popular show outside the United States. Do you know what that is?

ZACK GUZMAN: [NO SPEECH] Is that the one you're talking about?

MARC RANDOLPH: That's the one. And I go, I probably should watch this show. And it's actually surprisingly good. A little soap opera-y. But it's actually pretty compelling.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yes, Money Heist, for those English speakers out there as well. I noticed they changed the title. But I'm right there with you. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I watched Love is Blind as well. Very interesting content choices being made out there at Netflix.

Video Transcript

ZACK GUZMAN: Now, we're also keeping our eyes on Netflix shares, off just slightly, off about 3% despite the overall rally we're seeing in the market right now. Of course, the streaming giant reported earnings yesterday, and revenue came in mostly in line with expectations. Earnings per share was off just slightly due to currency effects there off of a stronger dollar.

But the big takeaway was that Netflix added an impressive record 15.7 million subscribers across the globe, that a high watermark for Netflix. And for more on the quarter and the way that it's navigating the benefit here from a lot of people staying at home, I want to bring on the co-founder of Netflix, Marc Randolph, also the first CEO of Netflix as well, before Reed Hastings took over, and the author of ""That Will Never Work."" He joins us now.

Marc, it's good to see you again. When we look at the quarter, obviously, clearly, we heard on the earnings call that they did catch a benefit from more people in lockdown mode, staying at home, turning to Netflix, to streaming these things. What's your take on I guess that trend and how it could maybe we could see that even off, as we move along here in the year?

MARC RANDOLPH: Well, listen, first of all, I've got to start by crowing a little bit about this accomplishment and having this level of subscribers. I mean, you have to keep in mind that we started this subscription business almost 20 years ago. And back then, our analytics were pretty weak, so we only got these subscriber numbers once a week. And I remember, it was like a teenager waiting to see his Instagram likes come through, just waiting to see what these numbers were.

You know, I've even got framed in my office the print out of hitting 500,000 subscribers. But it took us 10 plus years to hit 16 million total, and Netflix hit that in a single quarter. So what is it 183, 182 million total paid subscribers? These numbers just absolutely remarkable, but you know, the thing is-- and you probably picked this up from the earnings call-- is that, you know, they were very, very cautious about saying that these were most likely one-time-effect numbers.

Story continues

And in fact, even more cautionary that these probably reflected numbers being pulled in from future quarters. And here's the real insight that I took away from listening to the earnings call yesterday is they used the word guess. Reed was saying, this is a guess. There's lots of guesswork here, and in 25 years of working with Reed and watching Reed, I have to tell you, he does not use the words guess and guesswork lightly. And I think that really fundamentally is a reflection on the times, is that we really don't know what the future holds, not just for Netflix but for business as a whole.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, but I mean, at least he did give, I mean, we've seen so many companies cut guidelines and estimates. At least he was sticking with something to give investors there when we look forward, but there was also a couple other things there. When you looked into the numbers itself, of course, Netflix has been spending a lot on its content. That has been the case for quite some time.

When you think about the numbers that they spend to, I believe it was, RBO Capital Markets looking at-- or BMO Capital Markets looking at how much they could spend. They'd spent about $15 billion for content last year, could top $17 billion, according to them, this year, but on a cash burn basis, $3 billion has been historically what Netflix has been burning per year. They said that number could drop to $1 billion this year.

So I mean, when you think about how much money is going into the content side here to keep up, especially as we have a whole bunch of entrants, I'd be curious to know what you're watching at your own home too. Is it Disney Plus is out there now, and you've got Peacock coming too. I mean, what's your idea here, and what do you make of the way that they continue to spend on content and as it gets more competitive?

MARC RANDOLPH: You know, well, certainly, Netflix is staking its future on its content, and they're certainly spending commensurate with the size of their audience and commensurate with the fact that they are in the clear, dominant leadership position. I mean, even with the announcement of suspension of production in so many places, you know, Netflix announced yesterday that, in fact, they pretty much had 2020 in the can. And so these delays are going to be pushed out to 2021, but it's going to be faced by every single streaming service at the same time.

But you know, I'm not overly worried about the size of the spend. I mean, especially if you look at its commensurate with subscriber growth. And I think it really is a dominant thing for them to be able to outspend so dramatically players like Disney and players like Apple and Prime.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and I mean, you mentioned Reed Hastings, and I know you guys you documented your relationship with him in the book ""That Will Never Work."" I loved reading about how you guys operated together in the early days. He did have a lot of praise though for one competitor, Disney Plus, on the earnings call. I just want to play what he had to say about their growth so far and then get your reaction on the other side. Here's what he said.

REED HASTINGS: You know, I've been so impressed with the Disney Plus execution. You know, over 20 years of watching different businesses, incumbents, like Blockbuster and Walmart and all of these companies, I've never seen such a good execution, you know, of the incumbent learning the new way and mastering it.

ZACK GUZMAN: He's there. You know him. I mean, what are your thoughts on the way that he's not necessarily fearful of the competition here and actually giving praise to Disney?

MARC RANDOLPH: Well, I must echo. I've got to echo what he's saying, is I'm actually very impressed with the job that Disney has done. I mean, even from the moment that I first signed up for that service, I said, wow, the real fit and finish here is pretty superb. And it hasn't diminished, and they certainly have really blown a lot of people away by hitting 50 million subscribers in six months. That's probably years ahead of what the schedule was.

But you know, despite Disney's success, it's really hard to build in two years something Netflix has been working on for 22 years. I mean, there are certain advantages to having 180 plus million subscribers and all the data that comes with that direct relationship. You have this history of remarkable execution, and you really have what I consider the secret weapon which is focus.

You know, Netflix is not worrying about theatrical releases. It's not worried about theme parks. It's not worried about cruise lines. It's not worried about live sports. There's a certain advantage to being in some ways a pure play. And we haven't even mentioned the amazing fact that, a few days ago, Netflix passed Disney in market cap, which I never in a million years could have seen coming.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and I mean, I'm sure it's kind of crazy to watch, you know, this baby that you helped create back then and were the first CEO of back then. And seeing how fast it's grown here to become the leader in the space, when you think about the streaming space back, when you were sending DVDs in the mail. But when you look at it too, it's interesting, because this is the first time, of course, Netflix will be navigating in what is pretty much guaranteed to be recession territory here, when we look at it, maybe since, you know, since the Great Recession we saw back in 2009. But when you look at it, is there truth in your mind to the idea that it is kind of a recession-proof stock here, recession proof company. As it is kind of, I guess you can make the case, replacement for going to theaters, as more Americans are kind of afraid of doing just that.

MARC RANDOLPH: I think certainly the events we've seen in the last few months have driven a lot of people to watch a lot more television, and that certainly does help a company like Netflix, as it helps all of the streaming providers. But I think, fundamentally, this is a much longer term play. I mean, what we're seeing is the fact that internet TV is the future, and the people who are really taking it on the chin is linear TV.

And we're going to see all of these companies have a long future, and yes, it'll be rocky. It'll be uncertain. There'll be a lot of volatility over the next 12 months, as the coronavirus shakes itself out. But fundamentally, long term, this is all about the migration from linear to internet TV and whether Netflix can maintain its commanding market share as that builds out, and I'm personally pretty confident that it can.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah. All right, and even despite the fact that you've been a big fan of Disney Plus as well and what they have built there, it sounds like a subscriber to them as well.

MARC RANDOLPH: Well, you know, it's an amazing time to be a consumer. You know, just a couple weeks ago, we had Quibi coming out. We had Peacock doing their soft launch. We have HBO Max coming out next month.

I mean, it's pretty remarkable to see all these options for us as consumers, and I think, quite frankly, it's a great thing for all these companies, because it keeps everyone on their toes. I think one of the reasons that Disney is doing so well and executing so clearly is because they know they have to. This is by no means a layup, and I think, ultimately, it's going to keep Netflix on its toes too.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-co-founder-platforms-q1-180835033.html?.tsrc=rss,"['0E7A.DU', '0P000132WB.SA', '0P00014M3G.F', '0P0001IHIR.TO', '31A.F', '52EJ04.KO', '8B51V.NX', '91USC.NX', '9673S.NX', '9A60B.NX', 'A50HZ.NX', 'ABC200131P00088000.US', 'ALGN190719P00170000.US', 'AMZN200117P02117500.US', 'ANTM200918C00280000.US', 'ARNA201218P00070000.US', 'BHC200717P00017000.US', 'BKNG191129C02160000.US', 'BKNG191227C01930000.US', 'BKNG200619P01110000.US']","['NETFLIX', 'REED HASTINGS']","{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.137}"

BRIAN SOZZI: There's is one tech company out there whose platform is insuring your work-from-home life goes as smoothly as possible. That will be PagerDuty. Here with us now is PagerDuty CEO Jennifer Tejada. Jennifer, good to finally speak with you. Thanks for taking a few minutes this morning. How exactly is PagerDuty playing in this whole work-from-home movement that we're all experiencing right now?

JENNIFER TEJADA: Good morning. Well, thank you so much for having me, Brian and Alexis. It's nice to see you, PagerDuty is basically supporting an invisible front line, the IT teams that sit behind all of your favorite on-demand digital brands that you're-- you're engaging with now that you've had this societal shift and the change we work, in the change in the way we work and we live.

So as your home doing your work also on Peloton. You're ordering stretchy pants from Lululemon because it's all about the-- you know, the work-from-home pants. You're leveraging your e-commerce websites, whether it's Home Depot or others because you're nesting around at home. They're see-- all these companies, they're seeing a dramatic surge in interest and engagement in their web and mobile apps. And PagerDuty helps IT teams ensure that everything's working the way it's supposed to and the right person gets orchestrated to the right opportunity or problem in-- in real time and at the right time.

And we do that through automation and machine learning. What's been really interesting is for most of our customers, where, like I said, some of the biggest brands that you would recognize-- we serve nearly 60% of the Fortune 100. Most of these teams have been sent home. So they're no longer sitting together in a network operating center, where they can talk amongst each other, solve these problems as they come up. And in some cases, some of these industries are seeing 10, 11 times the number of incidents that they saw-- than they saw before COVID-19 because people are online more hours of the day more frequently, looking for those services, whether it's entertainment or on-demand delivery to their homes.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Jennifer, how is all of this going to change our workplace when-- when we're-- when the pandemic is behind us? And what role do you see PagerDuty playing in all of that?

JENNIFER TEJADA: It's a great question. I think the way we work has been changed forever. I think our employees who have been working from home since March 9 have really experienced an increased efficiency and frankly a deeper one-on-one connection with their team members because you're seeing people face to face in Zoom or whatever conferencing solution that you're using. And that means that you actually can connect in a way differently than you would conference room to conference room or with people who were remote while you're in the office.

And so that connection's become, I think, really important. The efficiency of meetings has really improved. The fact that people are gaining time not having to commute is a big benefit.

But it also means that you've got to leverage modern interoperable tools so that you can work effectively at home. You're no longer sitting next to a service or your IT team in the office. And that means that IT teams around the world have been under pressure to deliver laptops, to make sure VPNs are up and running, to make sure their employees have Wi-Fi access. And PagerDuty is supporting those distributed teams as they-- as they do that in many ways.

We've also seen a change in how PagerDuty's been leveraged by executives and leadership teams for crisis management. So I can point to examples in the health care industry, where health care companies are using PagerDuty to get access to health care workers when they see a surge in patient demand, or where they're trying to virtualize their telemedicine services, where they've physically seen people in their bricks-and-mortar practice.

And we're also seeing large online retailers that are using PagerDuty for things like alerting their crisis management team when someone in their warehouse demonstrates signs of ill health, so very quickly get those people care. And so, again, it's-- it's the virtualization of getting the right person on the right problem in the right moment, no matter where they are in the business.

BRIAN SOZZI: All right, Jennifer Tejada, PagerDuty CEO, thanks for joining us. And thank you for keeping my Peloton workouts going. It's been-- it's been a tough month and a half.

JENNIFER TEJADA: My absolute pleasure. They are a great partner. And I hope we all come back to the office fit.

165,2020-04-21T23:36:30+00:00,"Delta, AT&amp;T earnings: What to know in markets Wednesday","Earnings from Delta Air Lines (DAL) and AT&T (T) will take center stage Wednesday.

The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel demand got hammered over recent months and major U.S. airlines have had to slash capacity in an attempt to preserve cash. Investors will be focusing on commentary from Delta’s management Wednesday morning for any updates on how the company is dealing with the ongoing pandemic.

Delta is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of 87 cents on $9.19 billion in revenue during Q1. On April 4, Delta said that it was burning through $60 million of cash per day and expected second-quarter revenue to fall 90%. Much like the rest of the companies reporting this earnings season, Delta’s big picture and guidance will matter more much than the company’s financial results during the previous quarter.

UBS pointed out that “For 2020, after factoring in the 70% grant as part of the CARES act, DAL will have about $21 billion in total debt and $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.” Katja Herbers arives for the Premiere Of HBO's ""Westworld"" Season 3 held at TCL Chinese Theatre on March 5, 2020 in Hollywood, California.

Meanwhile, telecom giant AT&T will also deliver first-quarter financial results ahead of the market open. It is expected to report adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share on $43.99 billion in revenue during Q1.

One major point of focus for investors will be on AT&T’s upcoming launch of HBO Max on May 27. If HBO Max launches as scheduled, it would be yet another streaming service looking to cash in during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tuesday evening, streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) reported that it added 15.8 paid subscribers in the first quarter, exceeding expectations for 8.47 sub additions. Shares hit a record high in after-hours trading. Meanwhile, media powerhouse Disney (DIS) announced earlier this month that its streaming service Disney+ hit 50 million global subscribers shortly after launching in key European markets and India.

With the streaming space getting even more saturated, it will prove crucial for AT&T to deliver a solid plan of action with its prepared launch of HBO Max.

Story continues

Furthermore, any updates from management on AT&T’s previous proposed three-year business plan will be closely watched. AT&T proposed the plan after pressure from activist investor Elliott Management pushed for a board shakeup last fall.

With cord-cutting still on the rise and COVID-19-related cost cutting, investors will also be paying attention to how DirecTV has been faring amid the current environment.

Other notable reports schedule for Wednesday include Kimberly-Clark (KMB), Biogen (BIIB) before market open; O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), CSX (CSX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS) after market close.

167,2020-03-27T15:04:42+00:00,Best ETFs of 2020: The Global X Cloud Computing Fund Should Be a Winner,"This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com’s Best ETFs for 2020 contest. Dana Blankenhorn’s choice for the contest is the Global X Cloud Computing Fund (NASDAQ:CLOU).

Since the start of 2020, the Global X Cloud Computing Fund (NASDAQ:CLOU) is down by 9%. Best ETFs of 2020: The Global X Cloud Computing Fund Should Be a Winner

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In a market infected with fear thanks to the coronavirus from China, that counts as a win.

CLOU had been outperforming the S&P 500 during January and February. The divergence has sharpened since things got serious on Feb. 19. Since then, CLOU is down 18%, but the S&P is down 27%.

Is This Still One of the Best ETFs to Consider?

CLOU is designed to track the INDXX USA Cloud Computing Index. This index encompasses companies that are actively involved in the cloud computing industry. Most are applications sold as services.

The largest holding of CLOU is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), an e-commerce application that was one of the market’s best performers in 2018 and 2019. Over the last three years it rose from less than $70 per share to a recent high of almost $600 before falling back to its present level of $415.

Other big application providers in the index are Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), the latter of which embeds voice, video and text into other applications.

Many CLOU components provide services for other cloud companies. An example is Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), a cloud security company whose shares are up 23% so far in 2020. Zscaler has been warning about risks in the “shadow IoT” world, the laptops and phones used by workers at home.

7 Small-Cap Stocks That Are Not Worth a Second Glance

Not everything CLOU touches has turned to gold. Among the losers so far are Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC), which provides cloud-based human resources applications. Paycom has been hit hard as companies have moved to lay off workers, and the shares are down 20% so far in 2020.

Story continues

Beyond Applications

CLOU doesn’t just feature cloud application providers.

Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), originally created as a Content Delivery Network in 1998, now offers a host of security and connectivity solutions for carriers. Its software works inside the network, invisible to most users. Its customers include service providers as well as enterprises. Akamai shares are up nearly 3% so far this year.

Another big holding is Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns data centers. These are the buildings, filled with computers and networking gear, through which enterprises connect with the cloud and clouds connect to each other. REITs are organized to build with debt and pay income back to shareholders. DLR’s dividend of $4.48 per share last year yielded 3.34%. Since the start of the year, DLR shares are up 13%.

Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) focuses on protecting e-mail, both the messages themselves and the mailboxes they rest in. This has become the most expensive problem in all of cybercrime, the company says. Since the start of 2020, however, Proofpoint shares are down by 14%, because it has been delaying profits in favor of growth. That’s an approach that is in bad taste right now.

The Bottom Line on CLOU

I had no idea a global pandemic was around the corner when I chose to recommend CLOU late last year.

I was just looking to win the contest. It seemed to me that remote work, and cloud applications, were fated to grow fast. Most CLOU holdings are growth companies, not dividend payers, and that aggressive approach will usually win.

As I wrote at the time, “To win a contest you must be bold.” Even by the end of 2019, the transition to the cloud was only 20% complete, according to International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).

That puts cloud applications at the center of their growth curve. Such companies have ample pricing power, limited competition and innovative solutions to offer. The way to growth is always on the leading edge.

So, it seems, is the way to safety in a panic.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Netflix securities between April 17, 2019 and July 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). The case, Wallerstein v. Netflix, Inc. et al., No. 19-cv-04195 was filed on July 22, 2019, and has been assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (2) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, after the market closed, Netflix released a letter to shareholders which revealed that Netflix missed its expected target for number of new subscribers. The letter to shareholders revealed that Netflix lost 126,000 subscribers in the United States during the second quarter of 2019. On the same day, Netflix held an earnings call to discuss its financial and operating results for the quarter. During the call, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer attributed the missed subscription target to the “timing of [Netflix’s] content slate” and price increases.

On this news, Netflix's share price fell from $362.44 per share on July 17, 2019 to a closing price of $315.10 on July 19, 2019: a $47.34 or 13.06% two-day drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Netflix's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

179,2019-09-05T18:40:00+00:00,"SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Reminds Shareholders with Losses on their Investment in Netflix, Inc. of Class Action Lawsuit and Upcoming Deadline – NFLX","NEW YORK, Sept.  05, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: NFLX) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, for the Northern District of California, and indexed under 19-cv-04395, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the publicly traded securities of Netflix between April 17, 2019 and July 17, 2019, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Plaintiff seeks to recover compensable damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

If you are a shareholder who purchased Netflix securities during the class period, you have until, September 20, 2019, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S.

Netflix provides Internet entertainment services, primarily streaming services.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (ii) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, post-market, Netflix released a letter to shareholders which revealed that Netflix missed its expected target for number of new subscribers and lost 126,000 subscribers in the United States during the second quarter of 2019. Also on July 17, 2019, Netflix held an earnings call to discuss its financial and operating results for the quarter. During the earnings call, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer attributed the missed subscription target to the “timing of [Netflix’s] content slate” and price increases.

On this news, Netflix’s stock price fell $47.34 per share, or over 13%, over the following two trading sessions, closing at $315.10 per share on July 19, 2019.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Netflix securities between April 17, 2019 and July 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). The case, Wallerstein v. Netflix, Inc. et al., No. 19-cv-04195 was filed on July 22, 2019, and has been assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (2) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, after the market closed, Netflix released a letter to shareholders which revealed that Netflix missed its expected target for number of new subscribers. The letter to shareholders revealed that Netflix lost 126,000 subscribers in the United States during the second quarter of 2019. On the same day, Netflix held an earnings call to discuss its financial and operating results for the quarter. During the call, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer attributed the missed subscription target to the “timing of [Netflix’s] content slate” and price increases.

On this news, Netflix's share price fell from $362.44 per share on July 17, 2019 to a closing price of $315.10 on July 19, 2019: a $47.34 or a 13.06% two-day drop.

Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Netflix securities between April 17, 2019 and July 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). The case, Wallerstein v. Netflix, Inc. et al., No. 19-cv-04195 was filed on July 22, 2019, and has been assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (2) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, after the market closed, Netflix released a letter to shareholders which revealed that Netflix missed its expected target for number of new subscribers. The letter to shareholders revealed that Netflix lost 126,000 subscribers in the United States during the second quarter of 2019. On the same day, Netflix held an earnings call to discuss its financial and operating results for the quarter. During the call, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer attributed the missed subscription target to the “timing of [Netflix’s] content slate” and price increases.

On this news, Netflix's share price fell from $362.44 per share on July 17, 2019 to a closing price of $315.10 on July 19, 2019: a $47.34 or a 13.06% two-day drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against Netflix, EQT, Eagle Bancorp, and Karyopharm and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Aug.  11, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. reminds investors that class action lawsuits have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT), Eagle Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: EGBN), and Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: KPTI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX)

Class Period: April 17, 2019 to July 17, 2019

Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 20, 2019

The complaint, filed on July 22, 2019, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (2) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT)

Lead Plaintiff Deadline: August 26, 2019

Class Period: June 19, 2017 to October 24, 2018

The Complaint, filed on June 26, 2019, alleges that during the Class Period defendants falsely stated that EQT's acquisition of Rice, a rival gas producer, would yield billions of dollars in synergies based on purported operational benefits. Specifically, on June 19, 2017, defendants announced that EQT had entered into an agreement to acquire Rice for $6.7 billion. Defendants represented that because Rice had an acreage footprint largely contiguous to EQT's existing acreage, the acquisition would allow EQT to achieve ""a 50% increase in average lateral [drilling] lengths"" (as opposed to more traditional vertical well drilling). EQT claimed that as a result, the merger would result in $2.5 billion in synergies, including $100 million in cost savings in 2018 alone. After the closing in November 2017, the Company continued to tout the ""significant operational synergies"" of the merger. As a result of defendants' misrepresentations, EQT shares traded at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class Period. On March 15, 2018, just five months after the acquisition closed, EQT announced the sudden and unexpected resignation of its CEO. Then, on October 25, 2018, the Company reported poor third-quarter financial results caused by an increase in total costs and disclosed that its estimated capital expenditures for well development in 2018 would increase by $300 million. As a result, the Company reduced its full year forecast for 2018. These disclosures caused EQT shares to decline by 13%, dropping from a close of $40.46 per share on October 24, 2018 to $35.34 on October 25, 2018.

Eagle Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: EGBN)

Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 23, 2019

Class Period: March 2, 2015 to July 19, 2019

The complaint, filed on July 24, 2019, alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Eagle Bancorp’s internal controls and procedures and compliance policies were inadequate; (ii) the foregoing shortcoming created a foreseeable risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and the need for the Company to undertake its own internal investigations; and (iii) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, Eagle Bancorp disclosed rising legal costs stemming from ongoing internal and government investigations of “the Company’s identification, classification and disclosure of related party transactions; the retirement of certain former officers and directors; and the relationship of the Company and certain of its former officers and directors with a local public official.”

On this news, Eagle Bancorp’s stock price fell $14.30 per share, or 26.75%, to close at $39.15 per share on July 18, 2019.

Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: KPTI)

Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 23, 2019

Class Period: March 2, 2017 to February 22, 2019

The Complaint, filed on July 23, 2019, alleges that during the Class Period defendants falsely represented the safety and efficacy of selinexor, a pharmaceutical drug intended for the treatment of various types of cancer that Karyopharm was in the process of developing. Specifically, defendants' material misrepresentations and omissions center on defendants' claims regarding results from clinical trials for selinexor's treatment of patients with certain types of blood cancer. During the Class Period, defendants claimed that selinexor studies showed that selinexor was ""well-tolerated"" by patients and explained that there were ""no new clinically significant adverse events in the patients receiving selinexor."" The Company repeatedly touted the commercial prospects for selinexor and consistently described selinexor as having a ""predictable and manageable tolerability profile"" and a ""very nice safety profile."" In reality, selinexor was unsafe with limited efficacy.

The truth was revealed on February 22, 2019, when the Federal Drug Administration (""FDA"") released a briefing document that expressed serious concerns with selinexor. Specifically, the FDA revealed that, contrary to Karyopharm's assurances, one of the previously cancelled selinexor trials had resulted in ""worse overall survival"" for certain patients treated with selinexor, which ""highlight[ed] the toxicity of this drug."" The FDA unambiguously concluded that ""[t]reatment with selinexor is associated with significant toxicity"" and has ""limited efficacy."" These disclosures caused the Company's stock price to decline from $8.97 per share to $5.07 per share, or more than 43%.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Netflix securities between April 17, 2019 and July 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). The case, Wallerstein v. Netflix, Inc. et al., No. 19-cv-04195 was filed on July 22, 2019, and has been assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (2) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, after the market closed, Netflix released a letter to shareholders which revealed that Netflix missed its expected target for number of new subscribers. The letter to shareholders revealed that Netflix lost 126,000 subscribers in the United States during the second quarter of 2019. On the same day, Netflix held an earnings call to discuss its financial and operating results for the quarter. During the call, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer attributed the missed subscription target to the “timing of [Netflix’s] content slate” and price increases.

On this news, Netflix's share price fell from $362.44 per share on July 17, 2019 to a closing price of $315.10 on July 19, 2019: a $47.34 or a 13.06% two-day drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Netflix's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of all those who purchased Netflix securities between April 17, 2019 and July 17, 2019 (the ""Class Period""). The case, Wallerstein v. Netflix, Inc. et al., No. 19-cv-04195 was filed on July 22, 2019, and has been assigned to Judge Lucy H. Koh.

The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) Netflix would not be able to gain its expected target number of new subscribers in the second quarter of 2019; (2) Netflix would also lose subscribers from the United States in the second quarter of 2019; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On July 17, 2019, after the market closed, Netflix released a letter to shareholders which revealed that Netflix missed its expected target for number of new subscribers. The letter to shareholders revealed that Netflix lost 126,000 subscribers in the United States during the second quarter of 2019. On the same day, Netflix held an earnings call to discuss its financial and operating results for the quarter. During the call, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer attributed the missed subscription target to the “timing of [Netflix’s] content slate” and price increases.

On this news, Netflix's share price fell from $362.44 per share on July 17, 2019 to a closing price of $315.10 on July 19, 2019: a $47.34 or a 13.06% two-day drop.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Netflix's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

213,2019-03-07T15:20:00+00:00,"In Era of Elevated Risk, Reputation Institute Says it’s ‘Reputation Judgement Day’ in 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 – World’s Largest Corporate Reputation Study","Boston, MA, March  07, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- It’s a new age for corporate reputation, in which companies are scrutinized on every aspect of their operations, and it’s putting tremendous pressure on companies who are increasingly on trial in the court of public opinion.

In the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100, an annual ranking of public perception toward the world’s top companies, researchers at the Reputation Institute – a leading provider of reputation measurement and management services – surveyed more than 230,000 individuals in 15 countries.

While the overall results of the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 show improvement over 2018, which saw a reputation decline, Reputation Institute Chief Reputation Officer Stephen Hahn-Griffiths says companies must continue to work hard to convert “fence sitters who are much less likely to give companies the benefit of the doubt.”

“It’s reputation judgement day, given that 52% of the world have doubts about the good intentions of all companies,” said Hahn-Griffiths. “At the same time, companies have a great opportunity to create and deliver reputation assurances that, over time, can convert fence sitters to promoters. Companies that elevate positive perceptions of the enterprise, prioritize corporate responsibility, leverage strong leadership, are ethical, speak to the corporate brand purpose and engage market influences are those who will win in this daunting new reputation era.”

While a lack of assurances means that overall company support did not bounce back to the lofty levels of 2017, an increase of 1.0 points in reputation in the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 signals the potential for a true reputation recovery.

“The reputation bubble burst in 2018, but there has been a reputation recovery in the past 12 months,” said Hahn-Griffiths. “Companies like Netflix and Microsoft have strengthened their reputation. Others like Facebook, even Google, have declined and have been punished in the court of public opinion. And some have even started to turn things around, such as Uber.”

In the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100, Rolex and The LEGO Group maintain the leading positions. Netflix surged from 24thplace to ninth place while Michelin moves up to the eight spot. The BMW Group, which placed ninth a year ago, and Google (third in 2018), slipped out of the top 10. Facebook had the biggest overall decline in reputation, largely driven by its perceived short-comings on governance andin the workplace.

The top 10 companies in the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 are:

RolexThe LEGO GroupThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS)Adidas Group (OTCQX: ADDYY)Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Sony (NYSE: SNE)Canon (NYSE: CAJ)Michelin (OTCMKTS: MGDDY)Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)The Bosch Group (NYSE: AVX)

“It is very rewarding to be ranked first on the Global RepTrak 100 for the fourth year in a row,” said Virginie Chevailler, Head of Public Relations at Rolex. “The company has a history of more than a century of perpetual improvement and innovation at every level. We believe this is recognition of our commitment to always reach further, along with our desire to contribute to society.”

Microsoft bucked the reputation trend among technology companies and jumped five places to number five in the 2019 rankings. Among other assurances, Microsoft has remained transparent in the face of product bugs and updates.

“We’re humbled to be recognized amongst the five most reputable global brands as it reflects our commitment to ethics, transparency, and corporate responsibility” said Steve Clayton, General Manager – Communications, at Microsoft.

The RT100 is based on more than 230,000 individual ratings collected in the first quarter of 2018. It includes comparative rankings, demographic trends, and unique insights into the dynamics behind reputational impact. The global study shows what drives trust and identifies supportive behaviors such as intent to purchase a company’s products, willingness to invest in, or even work for, the company.

Rankings dropped for 58 percent of companies in the RT100. Aligned with the decline in reputation, garnering support among stakeholders has become more difficult for companies; expectations have risen, making it harder to earn trust, attain benefit of the doubt, create consumer loyalty and entice investors.

“The reputation bubble has burst. Companies are down by an average of 1.4 points globally, representing the first major decline since the end of the Great Recession,” said Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, Executive Partner and Chief Research Officer for Reputation Institute.

 RI measures the reputation of thousands of companies on an annual basis using its RepTrak® framework. Its Global RT100 study measures the most highly regarded and familiar multinational companies in 15 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

About Reputation Institute Reputation Institute powers the world’s most reputable companies. By tracking and analyzing stakeholder perceptions, we unleash the power of reputation to enable leaders to build better companies. Our RepTrak® model analyzes the reputations of companies and is best known as the Forbes-published Global RepTrak 100. Underlying the model is the RepTrak methodology, the global gold standard for measuring reputation. Learn more at: http://www.reputationinstitute.com.

Shareholders and a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of May 1, 2017 (NFLX)","NEW YORK, April  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Klein Law Firm announces that a class action complaint has been filed on behalf of shareholders of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) who purchased shares between July 22, 2014 and October 15, 2014. The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.

In May 2014, Netflix raised the price of its monthly streaming subscription to fund its content obligations. The complaint alleges that Company insiders knew from prior experience and analyses that price increases could have a substantial negative impact on subscriber growth; yet on July 21, 2014, CEO Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells told the market that the impact of the price increase had been “minimal” and “nominal.” The complaint alleges, however, that just three months later, on October 15, 2014, Defendants revealed that subscriber growth numbers were so low that the Company was forced to slash its projected earnings by nearly half, suggesting that “[as] best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher price we now have compared to a year ago.”

Shareholders have until May 1, 2017 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status. Your ability to share in any recovery does not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. You may choose to be an absent class member.

(NFLX) & Lead Plaintiff Deadline - May 1, 2017","NEW YORK, April  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NFLX) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Netflix securities between July 22, 2014 and October 15, 2014, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: http://www.bgandg.com/nflx.

This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts. Specifically, Netflix failed to notify investors that its May 2014 price increase for monthly streaming subscriptions would not have a substantial effect on subscriber growth. Instead, on July 21, 2014, Netflix told investors that this price increase had a “minimal” and “nominal” impact on subscriber growth and that any negative effect on revenue was “background noise” with “no noticeable effect in the business.”

On October 15, 2014, Netflix revealed that its “[Y]ear on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US.” Following this news, Netflix stock dropped, damaging investors.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint you can visit the firm’s site: http://www.bgandg.com/nflx or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Investor Relations Analyst, Yael Hurwitz of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 212-697-6484.

(Nasdaq:NFLX) (“Netflix” or the “Company”) common stock during the period between July 22, 2014 and October 15, 2014, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until May 1, 2017 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.

If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement for the class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Netflix common stock during the Class Period. Members of the class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff.  No class has yet been certified in the above action.

The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that Netflix's 2014 price increase materially impeded subscriber growth.

According to the complaint, following an October 15, 2014 announcement that its price increase had substantially slowed subscriber growth and sharply reduced the Company's near-term earnings outlook, the value of Netflix shares declined significantly.

(NFLX) & Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2017","NEW YORK, March  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NFLX) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Netflix securities between July 22, 2014 and October 15, 2014, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: http://www.bgandg.com/nflx.

This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts. Specifically, Netflix failed to notify investors that its May 2014 price increase for monthly streaming subscriptions would not have a substantial effect on subscriber growth. Instead, on July 21, 2014, Netflix told investors that this price increase had a “minimal” and “nominal” impact on subscriber growth and that any negative effect on revenue was “background noise” with “no noticeable effect in the business.”

On October 15, 2014, Netflix revealed that its “[Y]ear on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US.” Following this news, Netflix stock dropped, damaging investors.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

On this news, the price of Netflix's shares plummeted.

About the Lawsuit

Netflix and certain of its officers and directors are charged with making a series of materially false and misleading statements and omissions related to the Company’s business and operations in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The allegations surround Netflix’s May 2014 price increase for monthly streaming subscriptions, and the Company’s failure to inform investors that – consistent with the Company’s prior experiences – the price increase could have a big, negative impact on subscriber growth.  Instead, on July 21, 2014 the Company representatives told the market that the price increase had a “minimal” and “nominal” impact on subscriber growth, further stating that any adverse effect on revenue was “background noise” which had “no noticeable effect in the business.”

Less than three months later, on October 15, 2014, and contrary to its earlier statements dismissing the “minimal” adverse impact, the Company revealed that the impact on earnings was hugely negative.  In fact, the subscriber growth numbers were so low that Netflix slashed its projected earnings by almost fifty percent.  In an explanatory letter to shareholders dated October 15, 2014, the Company stated, “[Y]ear on year net additions in the US were down (1.3 million in Q3 2013 to 1 million in Q3 2014). As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago. Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth, other things being equal, and this is manifested more clearly in higher adoption markets such as the US.”

As a result of the foregoing disclosure, Netflix stock plummeted by more than 19%, falling from a closing price of $448.59 per share on October 15, 2014 to a close of $361.70 per share on October 16, 2014.

238,2015-09-29T18:15:00+00:00,Back Stabber Show Producers To Drop Netflix And Move Show To Network TV,"Hollywood, CA, Sept. 29, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ""Back Stabber"" is the newest series being independently produced for Netflix,the online streaming platform that has changed the game in video entertainment.Netflix (NYSE: NFLX) has changed the way consumers access television shows and movies, the online streaming platform has caused a major decrease in cable subscribes, and has created some of the most award winning television shows and movies available.

The new series, within one week of releasing its show trailer, has already acquired over 8000 YouTube views. Though Netflix produced series have had tremendous success in the past, producers of the new show have recently been looking into taking the series to network TV stations, saying ""Netflix series don't receive the attention for potential profit from sponsors as network TV shows do, and being an independently produced show, Netflix is not funding any part of the production. Therefor, in order to keep the potential of creating the series, we will be forced to move to network TV if investors don't become available.""

Shows such as House of Cards, and Orange Is The New Black, have been pioneers for Netflix. Making over $100 million in sponsored ads its first season, House of Cards was the first Netflix Original Content to receive paid sponsorships, the Back Stabber Producers said, ""We understand that most Netflix programs don't do that well, but with our marketing team and advertising success rate, Back Stabber will become highly successful. We can technically finish the series with the funding we have now, but it would just end up being like all the others, and that is not our goal. We want to be a pioneer for Netflix, and with the potential the series has, itll be a shame if we have to settle for it being normal.""

Already reaching out to Karey Burke and Simran S. Sethi, the VP's of programing at ABC Family, as well as Lauren Dolgen and Mina Lefevre the VP's at Viacom and MTV, the shows producers are itching to move the series, saying ""The series would fit perfectly on MTV or ABC Family, and if we get the chance to meet with them and make the switch, it would drastically improve our chances of finding investors for the remainder of the series.""

Though Back Stabber has already partnered with Z Skin Cosmetics and Dell Computers, as well as having other major brands in negotiation, the show is lacking the necessary funding needed to complete the final production. As an independently produced show for Netflix, the producers will receive a pay-per-stream royalty fee, saying ""Because Netflix isn't just buying out the show, there is a lot of opportunity for investors to make their money back, which is information that is over looked by potential sponsors. And being paid per stream, the amount of money that will be made from the show is much higher than on network TV, so it'll be unfortunate if we have to move it from Netflix.""

Back Stabber was set for release in early 2016, but with the producer's recent decision to seek new funding for the remainder of the series, the new release date is yet to be announced.
