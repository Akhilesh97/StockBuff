0,2021-03-01T21:06:24+00:00,Zoom quarterly sales surge 369% as work-from-home extends into early 2021,"Zoom Video Communications (ZM) reported earnings results after market close on Monday, with the company's fourth-quarter results easily surpassing consensus estimates as still-widespread social distancing standards swept the country at the beginning of this year.

Guidance for the current quarter and full fiscal year also easily topped expectations, helping assuage Wall Street's concerns that the video conferencing's business might be sharply weakened by a broader economic reopening later this year. Shares surged more than 10% in after-hours trading, adding to a gain of more than 9.6% during the regular trading day.

Here were the main results from Zoom's report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg and the company's results in the same period last year:

Revenue: $882.5 million vs. $811.04 million expected versus $188.25 million year-over-year Adjusted earnings per share: $1.22 vs. 79 cents expected versus 15 cents year-over-year

In its fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom benefited from an extension of 2020's social distancing behaviors. A spike in coronavirus cases around the holidays spurred renewed business restrictions and made many workplaces wary to reopen too soon in 2021, helping support the ongoing use of Zoom's services.

Sales rose by 369% to $882.5 million, handily topping estimates for a rise of 331% to $811.04 million in the three months ended in January. This also unexpectedly accelerated from the 367% top-line growth Zoom posted in the third quarter. Customers with more than 10 employees surged 470% to 467,100, also exceeding estimates for a jump to nearly 442,600.

“The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to an unprecedented year for Zoom. In FY2021, we significantly scaled our business to provide critical communications and collaboration services to our customers and the global community in response to the pandemic,” Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in a statement. “As we enter FY2022, we believe we are well positioned for strong growth with our innovative video communications platform, on which our customers can build, run, and grow their businesses; our globally recognized brand; and a team ever focused on delivering happiness to our customers.”

Moreover, Zoom said it expected first-quarter revenue to come in between $900 million and $905 million, soaring well above consensus estimates for current-quarter sales of $829.5 million. Adjusted earnings for the quarter are anticipated to be between 95 cents and 97 cents a share, versus the 72-cent consensus estimate. For the full year, revenue will likely be $3.76 billion to $3.78 billion, the company added, also easily topping estimates for $3.53 billion.

Zoom's fourth-quarter results and guidance marked strong upside surprises relative to consensus expectations, which had forecast moderating growth after a meteoric rise in 2020 as the meeting software became the go-to platform for workplaces, friends and families to stay connected and schools to conduct remote learning.

And with workers and students set to return to offices and schools later this year, the specter of an even more marked deceleration has been a key concern, both for Zoom and other stocks comprising 2020's lucrative work-from-home trade. Zoom's guidance, however, suggested concerns of an unfettered slowdown may have been overblown.

At the same time, Zoom has also been expanding into new product categories to diversify the business outside of its flagship video conferencing service and offer a more comprehensive suite of workplace software. Zoom's two-year-old Zoom Phone cloud-based phone platform reached 1 million seats in January, and expanded its global coverage of the service to 44 countries.

With a GDP of $2.89 trillion and population of over 1.3 billion, India remains one of the biggest economies in the world with huge growth prospects. Despite the negative effects of the coronavirus crisis which caused the country’s economy to shrink by as much as 15%, India is set to surpass leading economies of the world over the next few years. According to a report by Deloitte, double-digit growth is expected for the Indian economy in 2022 based on the firm’s best-case scenario as the economy begins to come back to normal.

The report said that the top 10 income percentile of the Indian population is starting to spend more on elastic discretionary goods, which could rekindle growth of the private investment sector which had started to shrink following the coronavirus crisis. The report also added that the liquidity measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are also expected to boost the economy.

In January, a report by U.K.-based data analytics firm GlobalData estimated that the Indian economy is expected to grow at 9.7% in 2021, faster than all of the world’s major economies. The firm said this growth is backed by a massive increase in foreign direct investments, or FDI, Indian PM Narendra Modi’s $266 billion stimulus package and falling COVID-19 cases in the country.

Still a Lucrative Market

According to Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Indian economy shrank by 9.3% during 2020. However, analysts at the IMF have predicted that its growth rate will remain above 7% in 2021 which indicates that investors and corporations around the world would still find India a lucrative market to invest in.

""Although there are many heavyweights in India such as Reliance (NSE: RELIANCE) and Tata (NSE: TATAMOTORS), there is a huge emergence of successful and multi-billion-dollar startups. Most of the startups are concentrated in the e-commerce and software development sector. The latest figures put the Indian population at 1.366 billion. According to Columbia business school, the Indian middle class will grow to almost 583 million people or 41 percent of the total population. So, an increasing consumer market will lead to rapid growth in the shares of these companies' profits. That is why investment firms and corporations looking to invest in the growing economy of India should pay close attention to these companies.""

India, The Golden Bird

Right now, India has one of the most diverse and qualified workforce in the world. Corporations like IBM (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) hire thousands of Indians due to their acumen in management, technology, and financial subjects. Besides, many of these tech giants are being led by Indians such as Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella. India has emerged as an increasingly competitive market in the South Asian region. When Indian markets were de-regularized, it was thought that India would only be relying on multi-national corporations for fulfilling consumer demands. However, with the rise of e-commerce startups like Flipkart, Indian companies have now started to gain ground and become highly competitive as compared to their international counterparts.

Our Ranking Criteria For Top Emerging Companies in India

The list of new startups in a country on the verge of the social internet boom is a long one but we have devised the following strategy in order to rank these companies. It will serve as a guideline for potential investors and will offer a different perspective in making investments and informed decisions.

Employment growth

Employment growth is a measure of new employees entering the organization as well as indicating the growth in the size and scale of a company and its expansion.

Social Impact

Social impact is one of the major components for an emerging company’s success. Bringing in a new product, service or trend indicates a social impact. For example, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) created a huge social impact when the online streaming service introduced a new way of accessing content.

Funding & Investment

Many emerging companies and startups rely on seed funding as well as capital from investors and venture capitalists. It is also an important parameter to assess an emerging company’s future and profitability that can be gained in terms of ROI in the future.

Global Footprint

The last factor which determines any company or startup's potential is the level of its global footprint. Companies which operate exclusively in India are slightly disadvantaged. Although India has a massive consumer base, we believe a company needs to defy borders to scale and grow.

3,2021-03-01T14:43:03+00:00,"IBM Expands Hybrid Cloud Service, Targeting Banks, Health Care","(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. has publicly released its hybrid cloud service, furthering its plan to pivot the business toward the fast-growing market for storing large amounts of data on the internet.

The expanded offering, called IBM Cloud Satellite, allows customers to control how they store their information, with some of it held internally in what’s known as private cloud, and other data stored in public clouds such as Amazon.com Inc’s AWS, or Microsoft Corp’s Azure. As a latecomer to cloud services, IBM is targeting highly-regulated industries such as banking and health care, which have been slow to adopt internet-based storage solutions due to security concerns and scale.

For these industries, the integration of public and private clouds has been “too complex, too expensive, and a huge amount of risk,” said Howard Boville, head of hybrid cloud at IBM. To accommodate such clients, Cloud Satellite is designed to streamline cybersecurity, and make regulatory compliance “invisible,” Boville said.

IBM sees the evolution as a crucial step in Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna’s vision to transform the century-old company into a modern enterprise focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. IBM has collaborated with 65 companies, including Dell, Intel Corp., and Cisco Systems Inc., to help customers run workloads and to provide input on Cloud Satellite’s development.

Lumen Technologies, previously known as CenturyLink, will be a Cloud Satellite partner, and deploy the service at 180,000 enterprise locations. The ability to offer the Cloud Satellite service to companies where the data now lives, will help offer reassurance to businesses whose data is highly sensitive and who have been hesitant to move it to a public storage site, according to IBM.

“Only 20% of enterprise data is in the cloud today, we have an opportunity to help migrate 80% of mission-critical workloads to the cloud,” IBM said in a statement Monday.

Story continues

Since becoming CEO last spring, Krishna has moved quickly to implement the transformation plan for IBM. During an investor call in January, Krishna said that he was confident the company’s focus on those areas can help it achieve revenue growth in 2021, reversing a ten-quarter trend of no growth or declines in sales.

Krishna, who previously headed IBM’s cloud division, was the driving force behind the company’s $34 billion purchase of open source software provider Red Hat in 2018, the first step toward transitioning IBM into what it sees as a $1 trillion hybrid-cloud market. The company is also expected to complete a spin off of its managed infrastructure services unit into a separate publicly traded company this year.

Reportedly, the investment could be followed by a merger between Syniverse and a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). However, there is no guarantee regarding a listing via a SPAC deal or an IPO. The deal could potentially value Syniverse between $2 billion to $3 billion, including debt.  Companies nowadays prefer SPACs as it enables them to go public without a business and then seek a business to merge. The resulting transaction offers the target a listing. A SPAC option is more likely as the Twilio deal can send a substantial chunk of business to Syniverse. Syniverse may also utilize the SPAC deal proceeds for acquisitions. Twilio’s valuation rose from $15 billion to over $67 billion within a year from the pandemic-induced demand for cloud services. The company acquired customer-data firm Segment for around $3 billion, tapping its stock price appreciation. Salesforce.Com Inc (NYSE: CRM) acquired messaging platform Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK) last year for around $27.7 billion. Such cloud computing deals with creating remote work infrastructure could pose competition to software titans, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT). Carlyle agreed to take Syniverse private in 2010 in a deal valued at over $2 billion which did not go ahead. However, the Twilio deal and an impending listing could work in Syniverse’s favor. Price action: TWLO stock has gained 2.32% at $402 in the pre-market session on the last check Monday.

5,2021-03-01T11:25:11+00:00,February Ends in Green Amid Extreme Volatility: 5 Top Picks,"After a gap of three months, Wall Street faced severe volatility in February. Soaring yields on long-term U.S. Treasury Notes as investors reallocated funds from safe-haven government bonds to risky equities and market participants' expectation of an inflationary situation much faster than the Fed projected, triggered the panic button in stock markets in the second half of last month.

However, Wall Street maintained its northbound journey in February. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — gained 3.2%, 2.6% and 0.9%, respectively. Moreover, the small-cap specific Russell 2000 Index surged 6.2%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 are up 1.1%, 1.5%, 2.4% and 11.5%, respectively.

Meanwhile, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain stable. Despite the weaknesses in the labor market, personal income and expenditure have improved and savings are still sky-high. Nationwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and the reduction of new coronavirus cases to a great extent should enable the U.S. economy to systematically operate at the pre-pandemic level. Let's consider some near-term positives.

Catalysts to Drive Wall Street

First, in December 2020, the U.S. Congress has approved $900 billion of the second round of fiscal stimulus that included one-time cash payments of $600 and a special weekly unemployment benefit of $300. The immediate effect of this relief package was felt in January.

Personal income climbed 10%, marking the second-highest monthly increase on record. Personal expenditure rose 2.4%, the first gain in three months and the biggest monthly increase since June 2020. Additionally, the savings rate jumped 20.5% in January from 13.4% in the previous month.

Second, on Feb 27, the House of Representatives passed President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion fresh coronavirus-aid package. Per the bill, eligible U.S. citizens will receive a $1,400 check payment plus $1,400 for any dependent. Moreover, the extra amount in unemployment benefits would be increased to $400 a week and the period will be extended up to Aug 29. If Senate passes this bill, it is likely to significantly boost the pent-up demand for U.S. consumers.

Story continues

Third, in January, the core (excluding volatile food and energy items) PCE index — Fed's favorite gauge of inflation — rose 1.5%, year over year, which is well below the central bank's 2% target rate. This supports Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's repeated confirmation of pursuing ultra-dovish monetary policies for a longer period.

Fourth, on Feb 1, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the economy is expected to reach the pre-pandemic level of February 2020 by mid-2021. Goldman Sachs reported that total savings of U.S. citizens could climb to $2.4 trillion by mid-2021. Reopening of the economy with massive savings is likely to boost personal spending, which in turn should raise the aggregate demand.

Fifth, in its latest prediction on Feb 26, the Atlanta Fed estimated that the U.S. GDP will jump 8.8% in the first quarter of 2021. On Feb 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that economists on average expected U.S. GDP to expand nearly 4.9% this year from 4.3% in January.

Moreover, our latest projection for total earnings of the S&P 500 companies is likely to soar 28.1% year over year on 8.9% higher revenues in 2021 compared with an estimated 16.7% decline in earnings in 2020 on 0.6% lower revenues.

6,2021-02-27T22:30:55+00:00,5 Reasons Bitcoin Is Superior to Gold,"I expect to ruffle some feathers with today’s MoneyWire, but I feel very strongly that you need to know this information. Gold vs. Bitcoin: Old-school and New-school Alternatives to Fiat Money

Source: Shutterstock

It really hit me during a recent online get together with my subscribers. I asked them whether they owned gold or not.

Holy smokes … I couldn’t keep up with the responses.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I’m not going to tell you to run out and sell your gold, but I do think it is not the holding it once was. It’s time to question whether to own it.

For my money, there’s a newer and better alternative investment. It has the same characteristics but a lot more upside potential …

Stocks slipped about 2% this past week — most of which came on Thursday. The Dow fell 559 points that day and the headlines screamed. The issue was increasing bond yields, which can signal higher interest rates and inflationary pressures.

For as long as anyone can remember, the go-to investment in times of rising rates and inflation has been gold.

Well, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) ETF was down Thursday and Friday, so that didn’t help. And over the past five years, it’s gained just 37%. That’s about a third of the S&P 500’s 96% gain in that same time.

I’ve been telling anyone who will listen about the enormous gains that are possible by owning cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, yes, but especially smaller coins known as altcoins, which have even bigger potential.

Some gold is probably fine for your portfolio, but it is no longer the best hedge against inflation.

That title now belongs to cryptocurrencies.

Like gold, silver, and commodities, bitcoin and some altcoins serve as a store of value during turbulent conditions. In fact, they can be an even better store of value.

In bitcoin’s case, total supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins (and 88% of those have already been “mined”). Cryptos are basically next-generation software, so bitcoin is not a corporation or a government that bends to doing what’s easy or convenient in a given moment. Bitcoin has no president or CEO … no board of directors that can intervene and rain down cash bailouts on the over-spenders.

Story continues

But that’s just a quick glance at why I believe bitcoin is superior to gold right now. Here’s a look at my five strongest reasons …

Supply: Both gold and bitcoin have limited supply, but the argument is more bullish for bitcoin over the long term.

Authenticity: Bitcoin and altcoins can be verified on the blockchain in a matter of seconds. Verifying gold takes much longer and is more expensive.

Transferability: Bitcoin is a digital asset, so it can be sent via the internet to anyone around the world with a connected device. Gold can also be transferred, but delivering a physical bar of gold is not easy (did I mention they’re heavy?) and definitely not safe.

Liquidity: Bitcoin is sold on any number of large, billion-dollar exchanges in a matter of seconds. Gold is not so easily converted into cash, making it a lot less liquid than bitcoin.

Legal Tender: Bitcoin is only 12 years old, but it is already a payment option at many places … with more joining the list each day. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently announced its hope to accept bitcoin as payment for vehicles. Gold, on the other hand, is rarely used to buy goods and services. Can you imagine walking into the mall with a bar of gold in your pocket?

Bottom line: Bitcoin is the new digital gold.

In addition to many of the same hedge benefits as gold, cryptos also give you massive upside potential … especially altcoins.

Quite simply, people are waking up to the fact that cryptocurrencies are one of the most valuable, most revolutionary technologies ever created.

Cryptos and the blockchain technology they are built on are going to change everything. The way you buy everyday goods and services… purchase a home… pay your taxes … even how you order a pizza.

This transformation is already underway, but the truly seismic shift — when the massive profits are made — is coming as businesses, consumers, and those big-money investors realize what’s going on.

As they do, there will be an enormous rush into this asset class. In fact, we’re already seeing it.

In just the last month, bitcoin topped a market value of $1 trillion. Only four U.S. stocks are valued higher, and they are the big boys — Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Investment banks are also stampeding into bitcoin, including the biggest of all. Blackrock is the world’s largest asset management firm with nearly $8.7 trillion under management. The firm’s chief investment officer of global fixed income recently said it has “started to dabble in bitcoin.” That may not sound like much, but don’t underestimate its significance and the credibility it lends to cryptos.

In addition, one of the best-known crypto exchanges is preparing to go public and generating all kinds of buzz. Coinbase could start trading on the Nasdaq as early March. Based on recent shares in Nasdaq Private Markets, it was valued around $100 billion. If that’s the value when shares start trading, it would be the most valuable company to go public since Facebook in 2012.

And then there’s North America’s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Canada, which got off to a blazing start. Purpose Investments’ bitcoin ETF now has nearly $700 million in assets under management after launching a little over one week ago.

This big money realizes that if they don’t adopt a plan today, they will be left behind. The same is true for investors.

But this great crypto awakening is still in its early stages. That means there’s still time to get in for the big money … if you act soon.

7,2021-02-27T14:27:16+00:00,Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller’s Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article we take a look at billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks. The billionaire is making waves as he recently revealed that he is long Bitcoin and considers the cryptocurrency a valuable asset class. You can skip our detailed discussion of Druckenmiller's history, his hedge fund's performance and go to Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's Top 5 Stock Picks.

Stanley Freeman Druckenmiller is an American billionaire and hedge fund manager who founded Duquesne Capital in 1981. For 30 years the hedge fund posted excellent returns, but in 2010 the billionaire announced to shutter the fund citing “emotional toll” of not being able to come up to the high expectations of investors. At the time of closing, the hedge fund had $12 billion in managed securities. Druckenmiller’s hedge fund had posted average gains of 30% over two decades of its operations before it closed, an excellent record when compared to peers. In 2008, when most hedge funds suffered heavy losses and declined 19% on average, Duquesne returned 11%.

Duquesne Capital is now a family office.

The 67-year-old billionaire whose net worth stands at $4.4 billion today worked for legendary investor George Soros until 2000. The duo made a fortune when their bets against the British pound paid off on the famous “Black Wednesday” of 1992. Soros gave control of his hedge fund to Druckenmiller in 1989 to focus on philanthropy.

From Hot Dog Stand to Billions

Born in Pennsylvania, Druckenmiller graduated from Collegiate School, Virginia. In 1975, while doing his bachelor’s in English and Economics from Bowdoin College, Druckenmiller started a hot dog stand with Lawrence B. Lindsey, who later became economic policy adviser to President George W. Bush.

Druckenmiller's investment philosophy gives importance to macroeconomic factors that control the current market environment. Druckenmiller invests in both short and long positions and uses leverage to trade currency and futures.

A ""Raging Mania""

During an interview with CNBC a few months back, the investor talked about the current market situation.

""The stock market is in a mania fueled by the Federal Reserve and investor speculation that will end badly in the coming years.""

Here is what Stanley Druckenmiller stated:

""I think the merging of the Fed and the Treasury which is what's happening during Covid -- is obviously creating a massive ranging mania in financial assets. Everybody loves a party. I love a party. I assume you guys love a party, but inevitably after a big party, there's a hangover. Right now, we're on an absolute-ranging mania. We've got commentators on different networks encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40%, big market companies on stock splits. That creates no value, but the stocks still go up. I have no clue where the market's gonna go in the near term. I don't know when it's going to go up 10%, I don't know when it's going to go down 10%. I just want to remind people that there is no valuation support just because we dropped 10%. That does not matter because we are so far outside the valuation realm with the Fed doing what they're doing, that does not matter. But I would say that the next 3-5 years is going to be very very challenging.""

Druckenmiller Is Long Bitcoin

Druckenmiller recently revealed that he owns Bitcoin. The billionaire said that Bitcoin has a lot of inherent value and it’s gaining traction and stability with each passing day.

Frankly, if the gold bet works, the Bitcoin bet will probably work better because it’s thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it.

Druckermiller's Latest Moves

During the fourth quarter Stan Druckenmiller sold all of his position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), while increasing hold in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE: PANW) by 457%. The fund currently holds $335 million worth of PANW shares, making it Duquesne's 6th biggest holding.

Druckenmiller also trimmed around a fifth of his Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) and Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ: PENN) positions, while dumping his entire stake in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). Duquesne Capital also sold its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) in the fourth quarter of 2020. Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's Top 10 Stock Picks

Druckenmiller isn't the only one who struggled with his returns. The hedge fund industry’s reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter’s stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Before we start taking a look at Druckenmiller’s family office's top stock picks, here’s a an ironic remark the billionaire once made about the soaring tech stock prices during a meeting at Soros Fund Management, as reported by the WSJ in 2000.

""I don't like this market. I think we should probably lighten up. I don't want to go out like Steinhardt.""

He was referring to Michael Steinhardt, who closed his hedge fund 1995 after suffering heavy losses.

Let's start our list of Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks.

10. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS)

Value: $123,988,000Change in Position Size: 378%Percent of Stan Druckenmiller's 13F Portfolio: 3.3%

Walt Disney ranks 10th on our list of Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller's top 10 stock picks. The California-based mass media company aims to be one of the world's leading producers and providers of entertainment and information. Recently, The Walt Disney was able to clinch the 4th spot on Fortune's 2021 list of the ""World's Most Admired Companies,"" despite losing billions of dollars amid the coronavirus crisis. With a current market capitalization worth $358.5 billion, Walt Disney delivered a 60% return in the past 12 months.

According to our database, the number of Walt Disney’s long hedge funds positions increased at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. There were 144 hedge funds that hold a position in Disney by the end of December, compared to the 112 funds in the third quarter. The biggest stakeholder of the company is Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, with 11 million shares, worth $2 billion.

Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, said that they acquired a position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), and believes that there’s still a wide room for growth in the company. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their investor letter:

""Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

9. Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN)

Value: $128,369,000Change in Position Size: 0%Percent of Stan Druckenmiller's 13F Portfolio: 3.5%

""Penn National operates 40 properties (casinos and racetracks) across 20 states. In February. Penn National purchased a 36% interest in Barstool Sports, an online sports media company with 66 million monthly active users. Penn National is using Barstool Sports as the brand of its digital strategy and retains 100% of the sports betting and online casino (iGaming) proceeds in the relationship. Traditional brick¬and-mortar casino gambling in the U.S. is not a growth industry: however, two unique growth areas exist for casino operators: online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming. More states are considering legalization of OSB and iGaming due to Covid¬19-related budget shortfalls, as gambling can raise substantial tax revenue. Importantly, data shows that sports betting and online casinos do not cannibalize brick-and-mortar casino revenues. Additionally, gaming companies must have a physical presence within the states where they seek to have online gambling and sports betting legalized, so Penn National’s brick-and-mortar facilities give the company an advantage in this area. Shares of Penn National performed strongly during the third quarter in response to the company’s brick-and-mortar properties recently generating higher margins compared to pre-Covid-19 levels. a result of the company cutting costs and increased customer spending. Investors also responded favorably to Barstool’s September launch of its Sportsbook app in Pennsylvania. Additionally. sports betting and online gaming levels have reached record highs in numerous states.” Penn National Gaming, Inc (PENN)

9,2021-02-26T19:20:32+00:00,SolarWinds’s Security Practices Questioned by Lawmakers,"(Bloomberg) -- SolarWinds Corp.’s security practices in the years leading up to a major cyber-attack by suspected Russian hackers, who leveraged the company’s software to infiltrate government agencies and private-sector companies, were questioned by lawmakers in Washington.

At a Friday hearing on the hack by two House committees, Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, asked SolarWinds representatives about reports of lax security at the company.

Kevin Thompson, who served as chief executive officer at the time of the breach, defended SolarWinds, saying it had beefed security in recent years and spent more than most technology companies of similar size.

“I believe that we have, over the history of time, taken security seriously -- security of our internal systems, and the secure development of our products,” said Thompson, the former SolarWinds CEO.

The cyber-attack was revealed in December after FireEye Inc. discovered it while investigating a breach of its own. The hackers implanted malicious code into SolarWinds’s popular Orion software, and as many as 18,000 customers received it while updating the software. Far fewer were actually targeted for secondary attacks -- about 100 companies and nine U.S. agencies, according to the White House.

A persistent question has been how the hackers originally breached SolarWinds. At the hearing, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said the company was still investigating but had narrowed it to three possible methods. The hackers may have used a technique called “password spraying,” where the attackers “spray” passwords at a large volume of usernames. A second possibility was that the hackers stole credentials, he said, while the third was a breach of a third-party application used by SolarWinds.

Among the alleged security lapses at SolarWinds that were raised at the hearing was the use of the password “solarwinds123.” A cybersecurity researcher said he notified SolarWinds in 2019 that the password --- to one of its servers -- had leaked online.

Story continues

In addition, lawmakers asked the SolarWinds representatives about a former security adviser who had recommended ways to improve cybersecurity and had stated that “the survival of the company depends on an internal commitment to security.”

The hearing was the second time this week that lawmakers heard from technology executives about the cyber-attack. Executives from cybersecurity companies and SolarWinds appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Feb. 23 -- at a hearing in which lawmakers criticized Amazon Web Services for failing to appear before the committee despite an invitation. AWS wasn’t invited to Friday’s hearing, according to a committee aide.

Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, asked about reports the hackers used AWS servers to launch some of the attacks.

Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft Corp. and a witness at Friday’s hearing, responded by explaining the need for transparency about cyber-attacks, drawing a contrast between his company and Amazon. “I am here today. I am answering all your questions. Microsoft has published 32 blogs since this came to light. Amazon has yet to publish its first.”

An Amazon.com Inc. representative said the company wasn’t affected by “the SolarWinds issue” and didn’t use their software. The cyber-attack “demonstrated the security strengths of the cloud and the importance of modernizing legacy IT systems,” the representative said.

Bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee and technology executives who testified at the hearings called for a federal data breach notification law that would require companies to notify the federal government of cyber-attacks. Thompson, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said at Friday’s hearing that he would support such a measure.

Why It’s Important: Pokemon is one of the most well-known gaming brands and has been a key to the success of Nintendo thanks to its exclusive titles.

“Pokemon Diamond” and “Pokemon Pearl” sold over 17.7 million cppies on the Nintendo DS, according to NintendoLife.

The latest Nintendo Switch Pokemon games have performed well. “Pokemon Sword” and “Pokemon Shield” have sold 20.35 million units as of Dec. 31. Sword and Shield rank third all-time in the Pokemon series, which could show the strength and demand for the series on the Nintendo Switch.

Sword and Shield are the fifth bestselling games on the Nintendo Switch.

The Nintendo Switch sold 11.57 million units in the holiday quarter and has sold over 80 million units since launching in 2017. Nintendo is forecasting it will sell 26.5 million Switch units in the current fiscal year.

In 2020, Nintendo stock outperformed Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), two companies that released new consoles during the calendar year.

11,2021-02-26T18:03:55+00:00,Salesforce Posts 4th-Quarter Earnings and Revenue Beat,"- By Mayank Marwah

Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Feb. 25 after the market closed.

The global leader in customer relationship management software surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations thanks to robust subscription and support revenue growth. However, the company has issued soft quarterly earnings and revenue guidance.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CRM. Click here to check it out.  CRM 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of CRM Peter Lynch Chart of CRM

Snapshot of the quarter

The business software company posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, up from EPS of 66 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Analysts had predicted EPS of $0.75.

Revenue during the same period came to $5.82 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Wall Street had anticipated $5.68 billion in revenue.

The company further broke down the numbers into a 20% growth in subscription and support revenue to $5.48 billion and an 18.4% growth for professional services and other revenue to $0.34 billion.

The high revenue also includes contribution from Tableau, a data visualization software acquired by Salesforce in August 2019 for $15.7 billion.

In the Sales Cloud division, sales surged 11% to $1.36 billion during the quarter. Similarly, sales in the Service Cloud segment were up 19% to $1.45 billion. Revenue in the Platform and Other segment jumped 26% to $1.81 billion.

At quarter's end, the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities stood at a combined $12 billion.

Salesforce to acquire Slack

In December 2020, Salesforce announced it intends to acquire workplace messaging app company Slack (NYSE:WORK) in a deal valued at $27.7 billion. If the deal goes through, it would be Salesforce's biggest acquisition ever. The company plans to use a combination of cash and stock to buy Slack. Under the terms of the contract, Slack shareholders ""will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce's common stock on November 30, 2020.""

Story continues

Salesforce has been witnessing heightened demand for its online business software that supports remote working and is among the ""big winners"" from the disruption caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. Once the deal is sealed, the company would be able to provide businesses a cohesive platform to bring together their employees, customers and partners as well as their apps.

The deal would also intensify Salesforce's enduring rivalry with major cloud service provider Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the business and cloud applications market. According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives:

""For Microsoft this would competitively change the landscape and make Salesforce even that much more of a competitor (Dynamics vs. CRM) in the field as these two stalwarts further compete in the trillion dollar cloud opportunity over the next decade.""

Financial forecast

For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Salesforce is guiding for Non-GAAP EPS between 88 and 89 cents per share, while sales are expected to be around $5.875 billion to $5.885 billion, reflecting a growth of 21%. Analysts are predicting EPS of $0.76 per share on $5.72 billion in revenue.

The company also issued guidance for full fiscal 2022. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to fall in the $3.39 to $3.41 range. The company said revenue is expected to be $25.65 billion to $25.75 billion, reflecting a roughly 21% annualized growth compared to fiscal year 2021. This is inclusive of the $0.6 billion contribution from Slack, assuming the deal will close in the late second quarter. Analysts are expecting revenue to be $25.42 billion.

12,2021-02-26T17:55:52+00:00,Google’s Stadia Problem? A Video Game Unit That’s Not Googley Enough,"(Bloomberg) -- Google’s streaming video game service Stadia had ambitious plans to disrupt the gaming industry, which is dominated by consoles. The tech giant had planned to pack Stadia with original content, announcing two years ago that it was hiring hundreds of game developers and starting studios in Los Angeles and Montreal.

But those teams barely had time to get started before they were dismissed earlier this month as Google shut down in-house game development.

From the beginning, Google’s approach to video games wasn’t very Google-like. The Alphabet Inc. company tends to launch bare-bones products and test them as they grow. With Stadia, it came out big. Flashy press conferences and ad campaigns promised high-quality games with innovative features playable on Android smartphones or on the TV through Chromecast. Gamers would have access to a library of exclusive titles and well-known favorites like Assassin’s Creed without having to dish out $500 for Sony Corp.’s PlayStation or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

So when Stadia launched in 2019, gamers were expecting the complete package, not the beta model. While the cloud streaming technology was there, playing to Google’s strengths, the library of games was underwhelming and many of the promised features nonexistent. Other platforms offer hundreds of games a year, but Stadia offers fewer than 80, according to Mat Piscatella, an analyst at the NPD Group, which tracks video game sales data.

Players also didn’t like Stadia’s business model, which required customers to buy games individually rather than subscribe to an all-you-can-play service à la Netflix or the Xbox’s Game Pass. Paying as much as $60 for a single game, for it only to exist on Google’s servers rather than on your own PC, seemed a stretch to some. After all the hype, gamers were disappointed. Stadia missed its targets for sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Story continues

“I think it would be fair to say the messaging leading up to and around the launch was inconsistent,” with the final product, Piscatella says.

Stadia’s struggles are a warning sign for other prospective video game streaming services. Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc., both deep-pocketed major technology companies with experience in video games, have ambitions in the area with their respective xCloud and Luna offerings. But those products have rolled out gradually, rather than promising to be console-killers, keeping expectations in check.

It didn’t have to be this way. Google actually had a beta version of Stadia in 2018. Called Project Stream, it allowed users to play Ubisoft Entertainment SA’s popular game Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the tab of a Chrome browser. Fans were impressed.

The following year, at the Game Developers Conference, Phil Harrison, who is in charge of Stadia, unveiled what he called the “future of gaming.” He promised that Stadia would be more powerful than PlayStation or Xbox. He showed off innovative features like State Share, which would allow users to take snapshots of their games and share them with friends, allowing those friends to jump into the same game exactly where they had left off.

The prospects were exciting to fans and pundits, who predicted that Stadia could dominate the market, offering many of the same games as Xbox and PlayStation without the hefty price tag.

But all the buildup had some developers within Stadia worried, according to people familiar with the matter. Their deadline to ship the platform in the fall of 2019 wouldn’t allow them to deliver what players expected, they said. They argued that Google should position the launch as another beta test. After all, Google’s most successful products had followed a similar approach. Gmail was officially in beta testing for five years, for example, as the company continued to tweak and refine it.

There was resistance from Harrison and others on the Stadia leadership team, many of whom had come from the world of traditional console development and wanted to follow the route they knew.

Harrison had positioned Stadia as a traditional gaming platform full of bells and whistles, but that didn’t mesh with Google’s own mantra to “think big but start small,” as detailed in a 2011 blog post by longtime Google executive Susan Wojcicki, now chief executive officer of YouTube. “Watching users ‘in the wild’ as they use our products is the best way to find out what works, then we can act on that feedback,” she wrote. “It’s much better to learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far down the wrong path.”

A British video game industry veteran, Harrison was a prominent face at both PlayStation and Xbox during their worst console launches — the overpriced PlayStation 3 and badly managed Xbox One. He joined Google in 2018 as vice president of Stadia.

His team wooed big-name publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., shelling out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption II on Stadia, according to two people familiar with the deals. The amount of money Google was willing to spend came as a shock to veteran game developers, but even that wasn’t enough. Video game platforms live or die on exclusive content. So Harrison also brought in Jade Raymond, a veteran executive who has worked on Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars, to start building an in-house development division.

When Stadia officially released on Nov. 19, 2019, it left critics scratching their heads. The library of games was small and mostly old, with none of Google’s exclusives available yet. Most of the features Harrison promised were not actually there, such as the State Share concept. The platform was only available through a $130 kit that included a special controller and Chromecast. Gaming website Kotaku called the marketing “random and terrible” and the platform failed to catch on. In fact, the company produced so many more Stadia controllers than it had demand for, that last year it gave them away for free.

Despite the tepid launch, there was optimism among Stadia’s developers that they could win over fans with exclusive games, so long as Google gave them time to thrive. They were excited about game prototypes that could only work on a cloud platform, pushing memory limits with computer-driven artificial intelligence. One prototype, according to people familiar with the plans, was described as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet, allowing players to interact with smart creatures in all sorts of fun ways.

Then on Feb. 1, Google suddenly pulled the plug on in-house development. Stadia will still exist as a service and continue to offer third-party games that are also available on other platforms. But without exclusives, Stadia has little hope of competing with big consoles or building an audience of millions. It seems unlikely to be the “future of gaming” that Harrison had promised.

While Stadia didn’t seem to follow the traditional Google playbook, without some drastic changes it could still face a pretty Googley outcome: being added to the long list of products that Google has killed.

So, as it continues to be a near-zero interest rate environment, dividend stocks have become even more important to investors searching for yield.

The problem? Unlike bonds, there’s a lot more risk in depending on equities for income. Bond interest payments are mandatory. Dividend payments? They can be cut at any time. However, that doesn’t mean you should skip dividend stocks entirely if you’re searching for yield. There are still scores of high-quality stocks out there, both with great yields as well as the potential for long-term gains.

Spanning across all sectors, these less-cyclical names could also be a safe harbor in a stock-market downturn. While it’s nearly impossible to time the market, with stocks generally still overheated, it may be wise to consider names that could hold up in a market correction.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

So, which dividend stocks should you consider buying for 3%+ yields and possible appreciation? These nine names come to mind:

Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) IBM (NYSE:IBM) Kellogg (NYSE:K) Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Phillip Morris International (NYSE:PM) PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL)

I have written before on the merits of owning CAH stock — both as a reliable value stock and as a great retirement stock. Now, even as shares have traded sideways for the past year, this is still a great play for investors looking at reasonably priced dividend stocks.

At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.66 times, shares in this pharmaceutical distributor remain very cheap. Plus, with a forward dividend yield of 3.73%, it’s a great income play, too.

However, the stock’s weak performance may have you thinking Cardinal Health isn’t doing so hot. That’s not entirely true. Beating both revenue and earnings estimates in its latest quarterly results, things are improving for the company. Not only that, its prior exposure to the Opioid Crisis is now largely in the rearview mirror. The only catch is that this isn’t a growth stock by any stretch of the imagination.

Story continues

Analyst consensus calls for mid-single-digit sales growth in the coming year. I wouldn’t expect blockbuster returns out of CAH. However, if you’re looking for a solid dividend yield with less risk of heading lower, this is a name to keep on your watch list.

Conagra Brands (CAG) Conagra (CAG) logo on a sign outside of a corporate campus

Currently yielding 3.18%, packaged food giant Conagra Brands is a great consumer defensive stock for dividend investors. In addition, trading for 13.23 times forward P/E, its shares change hands at a slightly lower valuation than many of its peers.

Of course, there’s a reasonable explanation as to why shares are so cheap right now. With the company’s results this past year bolstered by the stay-at-home economy, analysts expect earnings to dip slightly in the coming fiscal year. Yet, as the company discussed in its recent guidance note, that stay-at-home trend — specifically, the shift towards in-home entertainment — could benefit Conagra long-term.

In other words, the pandemic tailwinds that helped keep CAG stock steady in 2020 aren’t as much of a one-time thing as folks might assume. Now, that doesn’t mean shares are ready to breakout from their current price level of around $35. But with enough in motion to keep earnings steady in the coming years, its current payout rate is safe at today’s levels.

8 Risky Stocks to Buy If Danger Is Your Middle Name

On top of that, this name could see another boost in the years to come. Conagra currently pays out 42.11% of its earnings as dividends. For comparison, rivals like General Mills (NYSE:GIS) have payout ratios between 50% and 55%. Add in CAG’s relatively low downside risk if the market corrects and this pick looks like another great play among dividend stocks.

For years, “Big Blue” has had to fight the perception that it’s just a tech dinosaur. However, even as IBM makes the right moves — pursuing opportunities in both blockchain and cloud computing — investors continue to largely avoid this name.

As a result, IBM stock trades at a low valuation, with a forward P/E of 11.10 times. On top of that, shares yield 5.32%, a large amount in today’s low-interest rate environment. Of course, although I’ve talked up its exposure to blockchain and cloud computing, IBM is still being weighed down by its slow-growing legacy businesses. But, as InvestorPlace’s Chris Lau notes, the company is in the process of spinning off these legacy units.

Additionally, with IBM planning to sell its unprofitable Watson Health unit, the company is further streamlining operations. It’s jettisoning what doesn’t work and focusing on future growth. This opens the door to not only satisfying investors with yield, but also potential substantial gains in its price.

Unlike Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or the FAANG stocks, IBM stock didn’t shoot the moon during the pandemic. This may mean shares have less downside risk than the company’s better-performing rivals. So, with more on its side than just a high yield, consider this pick of the dividend stocks.

Kellogg (K) stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text

Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.com

Along with Conagra stock, Kellogg stock is another high-yielding dividend play in the packaged-goods space. Also trading with a reasonable forward P/E ratio of 14.63 times, shares of Kellogg currently sport a dividend yield of 3.85%.

Mass stockpiling at the start of the pandemic last March helped to keep this stock steady during the early 2020 market turmoil. However, trading sideways while markets hit record highs, K stock investors who dived in at the start of the outbreak have probably not been happy with their returns.

That said, investors who are looking to enter a position today may see better results. True, as one Motley Fool contributor discussed in January, Kellogg could be more of a “value trap” than a value stock. With the company’s pandemic-bolstered results likely to fall back in 2021 as well as limited ability to raise the dividend, it makes sense why markets are lukewarm about K’s prospects.

However, as InvestorPlace contributor Divya Premkumar discussed in November, you shouldn’t forget this company’s exposure to the “plant-based meat” phenomenon. Owning both the MorningStar Farms and Incogmeato brands, Kellogg could see better-than-expected results if it can grab market share from Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods.

7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Your Retirement

The jury may still be out on further price appreciation, but paying you while you wait with a 3.88% yield, Kellogg is another solid pick for investors in dividend stocks.

Kimberly-Clark (KMB) Dividend Stocks: KMB stock

Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com

Given the heavy amount of toilet paper stockpiling that went on at the start of the outbreak, it’s no shock KMB stock was fairly resilient during last year’s market maelstrom. But, after quickly recovering and hitting prices as high as $160, the stock has sold off substantially since last summer.

Now close to $130 per share, though, this paper-based consumer products company may be a great buy for income investors. Yielding 3.49% with a long history of consecutive dividend growth, this a great long-term income stock. That’s not going to translate into substantially higher prices for Kimberly-Clark in the short-term. But it could help the stock sustain solid long-term gains for investors with a “set it and forget it” approach.

That said, it is far from guaranteed that Kimberly-Clark will continue to produce slow-and-steady returns. As one Seeking Alpha commentator discussed this month, rising pulp prices could mean long-term stagnant share growth for the company.

I agree that rising commodity prices are a concern here. However, while inflation worries are now top of mind, the commodities rally we’ve seen could already be overdone. All in all, it’s too early to tell whether the 2020s will be another decade of surging pulp prices. So, I wouldn’t split hairs too much when considering a position in this one of the dividend stocks.

Lockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.

With a yield of 3.04%, LMT stock just makes the cut for this list of great dividend stocks. But this aerospace and defense play offers more to be interested than a dividend.

Sure, this stock has yet to bounce back to its pre-pandemic high-water mark. Plus, with Democrats in majority control of the U.S. government, some folks are concerned that the country’s defense budget could take a hit.

However, fears that President Joe Biden is bad for defense contractors may be overblown. Of course, the new administration could allocate defense funds differently than the previous one. But that may work in favor of Lockheed Martin, which is focused on advanced-weapon systems.

7 Dividend Stocks Offering Little More Than Danger

Better-than expected results over the next four years could mean solid returns for LMT going forward. Add in the company’s continued re-upping of its share repurchase program and there’s enough in motion to make this a great opportunity for income and stock-price growth.

Pfizer (PFE)

Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com

Despite news on the effectiveness of its Covid-19 vaccine, investors haven’t been too keen on bidding up PFE stock. In fact, shares are down slightly, at around 9% year-to-date (YTD).

On top of that, Pfizer is trending lower — selling for just 10.15 times forward earnings and sporting a 4.61% dividend yield — despite being a fairly cheap blue chip. What’s driving this? Well, there are a lot of moving parts behind this large pharma company.

Pfizer may have spun off its slow-growing Upjohn business, but with an earnings miss on Feb. 2, the company still needs to prove itself. Is this possible in the coming year? I would say yes. With the company upping its 2021 profit forecast thanks to its vaccine, this pharma blue chip has a better shot of exceeding current investor expectations.

And even if near-term results fail to impress, you can still get paid a decent dividend yield while waiting on this one of the dividend stocks. Pfizer has a payout ratio of just 46.8% and a 5-year average dividend growth rate of around 6.06%. That means there’s room for dividend growth. Bottom line? Consider this another great pick with appreciation potential.

Phillip Morris International (PM) image of hands holding handful of processed tobacco

First things first — I know not all investors are comfortable owning tobacco stocks. However, if you are fine with owning companies that are exposed to this controversial industry, PM stock is a solid name.

Why? I’ve talked quite a bit before about Phillip Morris’ former parent company, U.S.-based Altria (NYSE:MO). This international purveyor of Marlboro cigarettes and other major brands sports a lower dividend yield than MO — 5.55% versus Altria’s 7.71%. However, it hasn’t faced the hurdles that now burden its stateside counterpart.

More specifically, PM has encountered fewer headwinds in pivoting towards modified-risk tobacco products. For example, the company has found success in Europe with its smokeless Iqos brand. Altria, on the other hand, has experienced issues with its ill-timed investment in e-cigarette maker Juul.

10 Dividend Stocks Increasing Their Payouts

That said, with Altria bringing Phillip Morris’ Iqos technology to the U.S. market, prospects look bright for both tobacco companies. This may mean further stock price gains ahead, on top of both dividend stocks paying out above-average yields.

PPL Corporation (PPL) Dividend Stocks: PPL stock

Source: Shutterstock

PPL stock may be one of the highest yielding utilities plays out there. Still, investors seem cautious about buying it. Despite the can’t-miss 6.15% yield, shares have held steady between $25 and $30 for most of the past year.

The company’s planned sale of its U.K. unit may still be in motion. But uncertainty over this segment continues to weigh down the stock. Also, its recent earnings miss isn’t giving investors much reason to dive in, either.

However, with low expectations already baked in, downside risk may be minimal here. It may take a while for shares to move higher. But at least you’re getting a fairly high dividend yield for holding it. Add in the potential for a pop once it finally unloads the U.K segment and there’s plenty of reason to see PPL as one of the best dividend stocks out there.

Granted, don’t expect to get rich off of PPL. It may perform better in the future than it has recently. But, while I see it eventually hitting $35, a move to $40 and beyond may be out of reach.

In most cases, and maybe all, the rallies have gone simply too far. We’ve seen some meme stocks gain over 1,000%. Others have reached obviously unsustainable valuations.

But at the same time, there are fundamental underpinnings to the case for many of the hottest “Reddit stocks.” These aren’t shell companies, or straight pump-and-dumps. Investors are buying real businesses with real potential.

Obviously, those investors need to pay the right price for that potential, and that’s the big problem at the moment. But as the dust settles, there may be opportunities. And so it’s worth looking at the long-term outlook for 10 of the most popular meme stocks:

For all the hype over the $483 peak and r/WallStreetBets and the supposed “short squeeze” (which probably was actually a “gamma squeeze”), it’s important to remember what caused GME stock to start moving last year: solid fundamental analysis.

The early GME bulls certainly saw the heavy short interest as a potential catalyst for the stock. But they also argued that the market was mispricing the stock for two core reasons.

First, they believed the market was interpreting GameStop’s plunging profits as a sign of the end of GameStop. In fact, bulls argued, they were a sign of the end of the console cycle. With new consoles coming from Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), earnings would quickly rebound in 2021 and beyond.

Second, there was room for GameStop to pivot to digital and e-commerce. The arrival of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen only added to this part of the case.

That bull case was valid. It still is — at the right price. With GME stock soaring again on Wednesday, and giving GameStop a market capitalization over $6 billion, the price isn’t right yet. But once the dust inevitably settles, it may be again.

For AMC Entertainment, however, the bull case is tougher to make. That’s true even though AMC, unlike GameStop, managed to use its epic rally to fix up its balance sheet.

AMC did see lender Silver Lake convert $600 million in debt into AMC stock, which will lower debt and interest expense going forward. It raised another $300 million at roughly $5 per share in two days in late January. That was on top of $917 million in cash added between Dec. 14 and Jan. 25.

That’s all well and good, and AMC has created some breathing room. But it’s not as if AMC fixed its balance sheet. The company closed the third quarter with nearly $6 billion in debt. Even adjusting for cash held then, the Silver Lake conversion, and the capital raised since, borrowings remain above $4 billion.

Meanwhile, AMC’s share count has ballooned from under 140 million shares to 356 million shares at the moment.

At $9, then, incredibly AMC has a market capitalization near $3 billion. At the beginning of 2020, before the novel coronavirus pandemic hit, AMC was worth less than $1 billion. In fact, even with the balance sheet moves, AMC now has a higher enterprise value (market capitalization plus net debt) than it did at the beginning of 2020.

It’s hard to see how that makes sense. The pressures on the movie theater business were extant long before the pandemic shuttered theaters. The rise of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services is one factor. Consumer spending on better home systems during the pandemic likely hasn’t helped.

This still looks like a company with a significant risk of going bankrupt. It certainly doesn’t look like a company that merits an enterprise value of some $8 billion.

I’ve been bearish on NOK stock for years now. Even with the stock having round-tripped following a brief late January spike, I’m bearish still.

To be fair, there is a bull case here. Relative to earnings, NOK remains cheap. The opportunity in 5G is real.

Yet there’s been a bull case for years now. Nokia simply has failed to execute. Bear in mind that Nokia was on the winning side of one of the most lopsided deals in history: the $7.2 billion sale of its handset business to Microsoft. Microsoft dumped the business two years later for just $350 million.

That windfall didn’t help NOK stock. The merger with Lucent-Alcatel didn’t help. 5G hasn’t yet done anything, either.

Perhaps this time will be different. But that seems like a questionable bet, even with NOK back at $4. Meanwhile, Reddit missed the far more attractive opportunity: rival Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), which trades at a similar valuation with better performance and market share growth.

Express (EXPR) the storefront of an Express store in a mall

The group of meme stocks has some odd choices, and Express is one of them. Investors looking for struggling mall retailers had (and have) plenty of options. EXPR’s short interest wasn’t even particularly high.

All that aside, there was a reason Express stock was trading below $1 at the beginning of the year: the company is in trouble. Even in fiscal 2019 (ending Feb. 1, 2020), Express was unprofitable. Same-store sales were heading in the wrong direction, including a 6% decline in the retail business.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Before the Reddit-driven rally, the Express turnaround seemed like it had little chance of succeeding. Rather, the brand seemed destined to join so many other mall-based retailers that wound up in bankruptcy. Other than EXPR gaining 257% year-to-date, it doesn’t appear that all that much has changed.

Koss (KOSS) A Koss (KOSS) Porta Pro headset in a box.

KOSS might be the strangest of all the meme stocks. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with Koss. It’s just difficult to see what sparked any optimism toward the stock, let alone enough to send it up 3,600% in a matter of weeks. This doesn’t even appear to have been a short squeeze: short interest at Jan. 15 was a little over 12,000 shares.

To be fair, Koss is a relatively interesting company. Its core claim to fame is that it invented stereo headphones, back in the late 1950s. And before the January rally — and a curious one-day frenzy in late December — KOSS stock had rallied nicely from March lows.

All that said, this really is just a sleepy nano-cap stock. Koss’s twelve-month revenue is $18.9 million. Net income over that stretch is just $700,000.

And yet KOSS stock now trades at nearly 200x those net earnings. There’s seemingly no justification for that multiple. When and if KOSS returns to being a sleepy nano-cap, there might be an intriguing case. Until then, the stock is an easy one to avoid.

Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY) bed bath & beyond storefront (BBBY)

BBBY is one of the meme stocks that had a real “short squeeze” case. At Jan. 15, short interest was some 74 million shares — about 60% of the outstanding total. Even with covering since, about 28% of shares are sold short at the moment.

BBBY is also a name where both bulls and bears can make reasonable arguments. Bears saw a declining brick-and-mortar retailer with a leveraged balance sheet — an absolutely brutal combination even before the pandemic. Indeed, BBBY entered last year below $20 after touching nearly $80 in early 2015.

But bulls saw the case for a turnaround under new management. Concepts beyond the namesake brand, including buybuyBABY, have real value and the potential for a GameStop-like pivot to digital.

7 Stocks That Will Skyrocket With Government Stimulus

Simply put, BBBY was a battleground stock before it joined the rank of meme stocks. And although the stock is up 54% year-to-date, given the balance sheet leverage, that move doesn’t significantly alter the case. Bulls and bears likely see the name the same way now as they did two months ago.

Sundial Growers (SNDL) marijuana stocks Hand gently holding rich soil for his marijuana plants

I detailed the long-term case for SNDL stock back in December. Heading into 2020, Sundial appeared at significant risk of bankruptcy. A series of moves strengthened the balance sheet and positioned Sundial Growers for a possible turnaround.

By late January, it was already clear that the company was becoming more aggressive. And then the craziness started.

SNDL stock closed on Jan. 26 at 56 cents after a six-session losing streak. Over the next 11 trading days, it rallied a stunning 427%.

Even with a recent bounce, shares have shed more than half their value from the peak. There’s probably more downside ahead. The story can work long-term, and the opportunity for Canadian cannabis companies like Sundial remains attractive. Yet competition is stiff, growth has disappointed, and Sundial still has an awful lot of work to do.

A market capitalization over $2 billion doesn’t seem to properly account for those challenges. But like so many meme stocks, SNDL could be attractive again — when and if its stock price returns to Earth.

Investors cheered when Tilray and Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) announced an all-stock merger in December. Tilray stock rallied 18.6% on the news.

The optimism makes some sense. The Canadian cannabis industry still is trying to shrink its production capacity, debt and, most importantly, costs. The merger should help the combined company accelerate progress on all three fronts. It creates a legitimate rival to Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), both of which are backed by massive war chests.

But at this point, there’s no reason to play that merger via TLRY stock. Aphria shareholders are receiving 0.8381 Tilray shares for each share they own. TLRY closed Wednesday at $27.98, which in turn suggests that a share of Aphria stock should trade at $23.45.

These 7 Hot Stocks Should Stay Strong on Earnings Through 2021

APHA, instead, is barely above $20. So the math is simple and so is it lesson: investors who want to own the combined company after the merger closes should own APHA, not TLRY, before the merger closes.

Zomedica (ZOM) Persian cat with veterinarian doctor at vet clinic

The problem for ZOM stock isn’t just the massive rally: the stock is up over 3,000% from last year’s lows. The problem is that the story many bulls are telling doesn’t quite match with the reality of the business.

The pitch for ZOM is that the company is set for potentially exponential growth. Its Truforma diagnostic platform is set to launch. Truforma offers diagnostic assays that can test companion animals for thyroid and kidney diseases — with the results available in-office.

Essentially, Truforma is a veterinary version of what disgraced start-upTheranos promised. Only Truforma is, well, real.

But Truforma also serves a dramatically smaller customer base. Zomedica itself has said that the entire diagnostic market for companion animals should be less than $3 billion in 2024. Truforma is targeting only a small slice of that market, yet it is now valued at some $1.8 billion (including the significant number of warrants outstanding).

Truforma is likely to drive some growth. It’s unlikely to drive enough growth.

BlackBerry (BB) black berry (BB) logo on a sign outside of a corporate building

BlackBerry, the former leader in smartphones, is trying to reinvent itself — again. This time around, BlackBerry is trying to use its expertise in security to build out a cybersecurity platform.

It’s an intriguing case, albeit one that will take faith and patience. BlackBerry exited its hardware business back in September 2016. From that point to the beginning of this year, BB stock had posted negative returns amid a roaring broader market.

So this at the least seems like a “show me” story. Yet BB’s membership in the club of meme stocks seemingly prices in some level of success. Given how long it has been since BlackBerry has been even relevant, let alone successful, the rally seems too early. Patience seems advised, in terms of both the company’s results and the BB stock price.

In most cases, and maybe all, the rallies have gone simply too far. We’ve seen some meme stocks gain over 1,000%. Others have reached obviously unsustainable valuations.

But at the same time, there are fundamental underpinnings to the case for many of the hottest “Reddit stocks.” These aren’t shell companies, or straight pump-and-dumps. Investors are buying real businesses with real potential.

7 Cheap Stocks to Buy for March

Obviously, those investors need to pay the right price for that potential, and that’s the big problem at the moment. But as the dust settles, there may be opportunities. And so it’s worth looking at the long-term outlook for 10 of the most popular meme stocks:

GameStop (NYSE:GME) AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Nokia (NYSE:NOK) Express (NYSE:EXPR) Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) Bed, Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Zomedica (NYSEAMERICAN:ZOM) BlackBerry (NYSE:BB)

For all the hype over the $483 peak and r/WallStreetBets and the supposed “short squeeze” (which probably was actually a “gamma squeeze”), it’s important to remember what caused GME stock to start moving last year: solid fundamental analysis.

The early GME bulls certainly saw the heavy short interest as a potential catalyst for the stock. But they also argued that the market was mispricing the stock for two core reasons.

First, they believed the market was interpreting GameStop’s plunging profits as a sign of the end of GameStop. In fact, bulls argued, they were a sign of the end of the console cycle. With new consoles coming from Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), earnings would quickly rebound in 2021 and beyond.

Second, there was room for GameStop to pivot to digital and e-commerce. The arrival of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen only added to this part of the case.

Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com

But I don’t invest in the short term. I try to look out three to five years when I buy a stock. For the part of my portfolio that’s still focused on capital gains, ServiceNow stock looks like a better bet right now.

Here’s why.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Smaller Is Better

The first reason is a lesson about numbers. Small numbers can grow faster than big ones.

During 2020, for instance, Salesforce had revenues of $17.1 billion, $3.8 billion more than in 2019. During 2020 ServiceNow had $4.5 billion in revenue, just $1 billion more than the year before. Which company grew faster? It was close, but the answer is ServiceNow.

8 Stocks to Buy for March

Salesforce began by using database technology within a specific niche: customer relations management. That’s why its ticker symbol, CRM, has nothing to do with the company name. Salesforce now provides database application software across a host of business categories. Its pending purchase of Slack (NASDAQ:WORK) for $27.7 billion places it in direct competition with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in cloud office applications. It’s playing in the major leagues.

ServiceNow began with a similar database technology but focused on the construction and management of digital services. It has yet to move far beyond that niche. It’s still signing alliances around office applications, like Microsoft Teams. ServiceNow will control the workflow, Teams the collaboration. These are still believed to be separate at ServiceNow.

Betting on the Jockey

There’s another reason I jumped on ServiceNow beyond the way its numbers can still grow.

For tech investments, I bet on the jockey more than the horse. That used to mean buying a founder. No longer. Tim Cook didn’t found Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Satya Nadella didn’t found Microsoft. What you’re looking for today is a proven manager with a vision and the skills needed to execute. Get the right jockey on a fast horse, and you’re bound to win most of the time.

Story continues

That’s Bill McDermott. He’s been in database applications for two decades. He jumped to ServiceNow in 2019 from SAP (NYSE:SAP), where he was the first non-German CEO. He has forgotten more than many of his rivals know. Also, he still has some tread on his tires. He doesn’t turn 60 until August.

McDermott also knows about strategic acquisitions. His first at ServiceNow was Element AI, a Canadian developer of artificial intelligence applications co-founded by Yoshua Bengio. I met Bengio at the 2019 Heidelberg Laureate symposium. Attaching artificial intelligence structures to ServiceNow’s database-driven digital applications is, in my view, brilliant.

The Risks

There is more risk in buying a company like ServiceNow than in buying a Salesforce.

I got a taste of that when ServiceNow had some of its customer passwords hacked through its “Help the Help Desk” feature. This sent the stock down 8% in less than two weeks.

But the overall story remains intact. ServiceNow is disrupting the software industry, passing IBM (NYSE:IBM) on the cloud leader board. It is leading a workflow revolution in software, which it sells as a subscription service, a payment model I love.

The Bottom Line on NOW Stock

Smaller companies like ServiceNow carry greater risk than big ones like Salesforce. They have richer valuations. In this case it’s a price-to-sales ratio of 24, even after its recent fall, against just 11 for Salesforce.

You want to balance risks and rewards across your portfolio. On the growth side of mine, I decided ServiceNow is a better choice for me than Salesforce. I think it has more upside. But you can’t go wrong with either one.

On Feb 24, the Dow touched a milestone of 32,000 for the first time before closing at 31,961.86. In fact, Wall Street rebounded sharply last day, after nearly a week of volatile trading. The Dow climbed 1.4% or 424.51 points erasing a loss of 110 points at an intraday low. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% after wiping out intraday loss of 0.6%. Likewise, the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1%, reversing its intraday loss of 1.3%.

Wall Street has been witnessing a spike in volatile trading this month primarily owing to soaring yields on U.S. sovereign bonds and investors' expectations of growing inflation. A section of market participants have already raised concerns regarding a bubble in the market. However, we believe that plenty of near-term catalysts are available that will drive Wall Street's northbound journey. At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.

Dow Gains Momentum in February

The Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index — regained momentum in February after closing January in negative territory. Month to date, the index has rallied 6.6% compared with the S&P 500's gain of 5.7% and the Nasdaq Composite's rise of 4%. Year to date, the blue-chip index is up 4.4% compared with 4.5% of the S&P 500 and 5.6% of the Nasdaq Composite.

At its current level of 31,961.86, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 30,775.29 and 28,172.99, respectively. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trend setter, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.

Story continues

It is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.

Near-Term Catalysts

The U.S. government has ramped up nationwide deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, new cases of coronavirus infections and hospitalization have declined significantly this month. The combined effect of these two factors should lead to the gradual reopening of the U.S. economy, which has been operating at a sub-optimal level since lockdowns were imposed last year.

Moreover, the Democrats are moving ahead with President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid package to make it a law. Furthermore, last week,  Goldman Sachs reported that currently U.S. citizens have nearly $1.5 trillion in excess savings that could climb to $2.4 trillion by mid-2021. Reopening of the economy with massive savings and stimulus are likely to boost personal spending, which in turn will raise demand for businesses, especially those in the cyclical sectors.

Meanwhile, the impressive rally of stock markets and positive factors mentioned above have prompted a large-section of investors to switch their funds from safe-haven government bonds to risky assets like equities, resulting in soaring yields of U.S. Treasury Notes.

Higher risk-free return is detrimental to high growth industries like technology. Most of the growth companies depend on easy borrowing at cheap rates. A higher market interest rate will raise their cost of projects. As a result, market participants have started to reallocate their funds to cyclical stocks from growth stocks.

Notably, unlike the market's benchmark S&P 500 or the teach-heavy Nasdaq Composite, the composition of the Dow is mostly inclined toward cyclical stocks. Reopening of the economy along with high bond yields is likely to benefit the blue-chip index the most.

While strength in Cadence’s digital & signoff solutions as well as Cadence Verification Suite drove top-line growth in fourth-quarter 2020, increases in total bookings owing to strong renewal activity drove Aspen Technology’s second-quarter fiscal 2021 results.

Similar to Microsoft, Autodesk benefited from the ongoing transition to cloud. The company witnessed increased usage of its cloud collaboration products due to the remote working wave throughout the quarter.

23,2021-02-26T11:00:00+00:00,YF Spotlight: American educators search for common ground on school reopening,"Yahoo Finance takes a deep dive into remote education and how it's impacting teachers and students across America.

Video Transcript

- Chicago Public school teacher Quentin Washington has been teaching remotely since the pandemic began in early 2020.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: But what I love is, I love to see the kids interact with each other in this virtual space.

- But earlier this month, the music teacher and Chicago native received some good news. He was finally going back to his classroom for in-person learning. Thanks to the Chicago Teachers Union, which Washington is a part of, and the city government, K to 12 educators were finally getting their vaccine shots, allowing the school district to reopen schools that had been closed for months.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: And my appointment was this afternoon. So I actually just came home from having the first vaccine. But I'm glad to get it. It gives me a certain sense of security. And I think that every teacher deserves to have that before they're forced back into a building.

- But not all teachers across the country have been this fortunate. While Chicago's teachers had their unions fight for them and successfully reach a common ground with other stakeholders, which includes parents and city officials, others haven't had the same success. Since the pandemic first started spreading in the US, many school districts across the country have halted in-person learning, instead offering a fully virtual or a hybrid classroom to millions of K to 12 students.

The lack of in-person learning has been a major pain point for parents, who feel overwhelmed with balancing work and childcare responsibilities. But reopening isn't a simple process. Many teachers and their unions have stressed the need for their safety and well-being.

According to EducationWeek's estimates, as of February 24, 833 active and retired K to 12 educators and personnel have died of COVID-19. It makes sense when 85% of educators in an American Federation of Teachers survey said that they'd go back to school if they were given priority for COVID-19 vaccines. But as of February 22, teachers in 18 states were still not eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Story continues

This acrimonious dispute over reopenings has pitted many officials, parents, teachers, unions, and workers in K to 12 education in many different states against one another. One of those states is Texas. Jimmy Lee has been in education for 33 years, and is the President of the Association of Texas Professional Educators.

JIMMY LEE: And we have been asking the state to push the educators in the state up into the grouping so that they can get the vaccine, those who are willing to take that. And I think the majority of them are, because they want to continue to do what is needed in the classroom.

- On the other side of the country, the pandemic and the debate over reopening has also laid bare the fundamental problems that exist within school systems. In Rochester City's school district, middle school math teacher, Tom Rossiter, said the lack of financial resources has just been frustrating to deal with.

- So my district in particular, in Rochester City schools, realized last year that we were in a dramatic budget shortfall and laid off hundreds of teachers during the year last year. And then we got hit with a pandemic. And March 13 was our last day. And then we didn't have the finances to do a lot of the things that many other schools were able to do.

- The school district is considered to be chronically underfunded and faces possibly more cuts to the system. This will complicate teaching and learning even further, says Rossiter.

TOM ROSSITER: Our technology issues are so significant for all of our students not having access to internet at home and having to do MiFis and personal hotspots that have data limits, so the kids can't share videos and can't be as actively participating in lessons as many other students would be able to.

- Mark Luxemberg, who's also in Rochester, said it felt genuinely frightening to go back to school amid COVID-19 due to his personal illness.

MARK LUXEMBERG: I suffer from three chronic autoimmune diseases. I didn't return to teaching until October 1 because I tried to make an accommodation with my school under the Americans with Disabilities Act to teach fully remote from home. And I was denied that option. And I was scared to death to go back in September. And I took the majority of my sick days before I agreed to come back October 1.

- Teachers in Chicago were able to avoid this specific scenario.

LORI LIGHTFOOT: --that our children will be returning to in-person learning this week.

At long last, CPS has finally reached a tentative agreement, with the Chicago Teachers Union, that opens up the school doors for safe, in-person learning for our pre-K, cluster, and K through 8 students.

- But finding that common ground was a hard-won battle. And it took a lot of commitment on both sides to compromise.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: I know here in Chicago, one of the reasons that we've had such a hard time is because our school districts feel like they don't have to have those conversations with us. They're the boss. They can tell us what they want us to do and we're just supposed to do it.

So how do we find common ground? It starts with a conversation. It starts with an honest, candid conversation about where we are, where we would like to see ourselves, and what are some of the best ideas of getting us back into that place?

- Meanwhile, at the federal level, the White House continues to push schools to reopen across the country. Back in August, the Trump administration had doubled down on its efforts to reopen schools, holding even a press conference to make their case. During a CNN Town Hall this month, President Biden also said he wanted to reopen schools. He specifically said he wanted to open the majority of K to 8 schools, 5 days a week within his first 100 days. The politicization of the reopening debate has made it much more personal to many.

JIMMY LEE: It is very interesting that politics has influenced and bled over into the public school system. I can see both sides of it. I see some positives. I think the students need to be aware and see that there are people and that we have to learn and we have to try to teach them to be accepting of the fact that there are people who may not believe everything that we believe personally. And that's OK.

- Many experts and parents worry about a possible backslide in children's education due to months of missed in-person learning days. One report by consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated that since 60% of students started the school year fully remote and 20% studied at hybrid, the cumulative learning loss for children could be, quote, ""substantial,"" especially in math, as students may lose 5 to 9 months of learning by the end of this school year. Students of color were even worse off, the report added, as they fall 6 to 12 months behind, as compared to white students falling 4 to 8 months behind.

Video Transcript

- Chicago Public school teacher Quentin Washington has been teaching remotely since the pandemic began in early 2020.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: But what I love is, I love to see the kids interact with each other in this virtual space.

- But earlier this month, the music teacher and Chicago native received some good news. He was finally going back to his classroom for in-person learning. Thanks to the Chicago Teachers Union, which Washington is a part of, and the city government, K to 12 educators were finally getting their vaccine shots, allowing the school district to reopen schools that had been closed for months.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: And my appointment was this afternoon. So I actually just came home from having the first vaccine. But I'm glad to get it. It gives me a certain sense of security. And I think that every teacher deserves to have that before they're forced back into a building.

- But not all teachers across the country have been this fortunate. While Chicago's teachers had their unions fight for them and successfully reach a common ground with other stakeholders, which includes parents and city officials, others haven't had the same success. Since the pandemic first started spreading in the US, many school districts across the country have halted in-person learning, instead offering a fully virtual or a hybrid classroom to millions of K to 12 students.

The lack of in-person learning has been a major pain point for parents, who feel overwhelmed with balancing work and childcare responsibilities. But reopening isn't a simple process. Many teachers and their unions have stressed the need for their safety and well-being.

According to EducationWeek's estimates, as of February 24, 833 active and retired K to 12 educators and personnel have died of COVID-19. It makes sense when 85% of educators in an American Federation of Teachers survey said that they'd go back to school if they were given priority for COVID-19 vaccines. But as of February 22, teachers in 18 states were still not eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

This acrimonious dispute over reopenings has pitted many officials, parents, teachers, unions, and workers in K to 12 education in many different states against one another. One of those states is Texas. Jimmy Lee has been in education for 33 years, and is the President of the Association of Texas Professional Educators.

JIMMY LEE: And we have been asking the state to push the educators in the state up into the grouping so that they can get the vaccine, those who are willing to take that. And I think the majority of them are, because they want to continue to do what is needed in the classroom.

- On the other side of the country, the pandemic and the debate over reopening has also laid bare the fundamental problems that exist within school systems. In Rochester City's school district, middle school math teacher, Tom Rossiter, said the lack of financial resources has just been frustrating to deal with.

- So my district in particular, in Rochester City schools, realized last year that we were in a dramatic budget shortfall and laid off hundreds of teachers during the year last year. And then we got hit with a pandemic. And March 13 was our last day. And then we didn't have the finances to do a lot of the things that many other schools were able to do.

- The school district is considered to be chronically underfunded and faces possibly more cuts to the system. This will complicate teaching and learning even further, says Rossiter.

TOM ROSSITER: Our technology issues are so significant for all of our students not having access to internet at home and having to do MiFis and personal hotspots that have data limits, so the kids can't share videos and can't be as actively participating in lessons as many other students would be able to.

- Mark Luxemberg, who's also in Rochester, said it felt genuinely frightening to go back to school amid COVID-19 due to his personal illness.

MARK LUXEMBERG: I suffer from three chronic autoimmune diseases. I didn't return to teaching until October 1 because I tried to make an accommodation with my school under the Americans with Disabilities Act to teach fully remote from home. And I was denied that option. And I was scared to death to go back in September. And I took the majority of my sick days before I agreed to come back October 1.

- Teachers in Chicago were able to avoid this specific scenario.

LORI LIGHTFOOT: --that our children will be returning to in-person learning this week.

At long last, CPS has finally reached a tentative agreement, with the Chicago Teachers Union, that opens up the school doors for safe, in-person learning for our pre-K, cluster, and K through 8 students.

- But finding that common ground was a hard-won battle. And it took a lot of commitment on both sides to compromise.

QUENTIN WASHINGTON: I know here in Chicago, one of the reasons that we've had such a hard time is because our school districts feel like they don't have to have those conversations with us. They're the boss. They can tell us what they want us to do and we're just supposed to do it.

So how do we find common ground? It starts with a conversation. It starts with an honest, candid conversation about where we are, where we would like to see ourselves, and what are some of the best ideas of getting us back into that place?

- Meanwhile, at the federal level, the White House continues to push schools to reopen across the country. Back in August, the Trump administration had doubled down on its efforts to reopen schools, holding even a press conference to make their case. During a CNN Town Hall this month, President Biden also said he wanted to reopen schools. He specifically said he wanted to open the majority of K to 8 schools, 5 days a week within his first 100 days. The politicization of the reopening debate has made it much more personal to many.

JIMMY LEE: It is very interesting that politics has influenced and bled over into the public school system. I can see both sides of it. I see some positives. I think the students need to be aware and see that there are people and that we have to learn and we have to try to teach them to be accepting of the fact that there are people who may not believe everything that we believe personally. And that's OK.

- Many experts and parents worry about a possible backslide in children's education due to months of missed in-person learning days. One report by consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated that since 60% of students started the school year fully remote and 20% studied at hybrid, the cumulative learning loss for children could be, quote, ""substantial,"" especially in math, as students may lose 5 to 9 months of learning by the end of this school year. Students of color were even worse off, the report added, as they fall 6 to 12 months behind, as compared to white students falling 4 to 8 months behind. Becky Pringle's National Education Association notes that parents are aware of the challenges teachers face if they were to return to their classrooms, and that there's broader support for unions than publicized widely.

BECKY PRINGLE: Parents, and the larger community, believe in what our teachers have done over this pandemic and actually support our unions speaking up on behalf of our students. I want to be clear about that. So you get the salacious headlines and it's blown up. And I'm not saying it doesn't exist. It does, Reggie. It does exist.

25,2021-02-24T23:47:47+00:00,Nvidia Slips on Concern About Growth of Data Center Business,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares slipped on concern about growth of the company’s data center chip business.

During an earnings conference call, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the majority of growth in the current period will come from Nvidia’s gaming business. Some analysts worried that means the data center division will expand more slowly and they asked several questions on the topic during the call.

Nvidia reported data center chip sales jumped 97% to $1.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. It also gave a revenue forecast that beat Wall Street expectations. However, the CFO’s comments on the conference call curbed enthusiasm for a stock that has more than doubled in the past year.

The stock fell about 2.5% in extended trading, after closing at $579.96 in New York earlier on Wednesday.

The company has become a barometer of confidence at some of the biggest tech companies. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. use Nvidia graphics chips to help power some of the most widely used services on the internet. That business is choppy, with spikes in orders followed by lulls as customers use up stockpiles of chips.

Right now, the semiconductor sector is struggling to meet surging demand in some parts of the industry, and Nvidia has been caught up in this.

An increase in online activity and purchases of technology gear for working from home triggered a sharp rebound in chip demand last year. That caught some customers off guard, especially automakers. New orders flooded in and the global semiconductor supply chain is still trying to catch up. Nvidia outsources production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., which are swamped with orders. That’s limiting Nvidia’s ability to meet demand.

“Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming,” Kress said.

QuickTake: Here’s Why the World Is Short of Computer Chips.

Story continues

Nvidia is supply constrained “at the company level,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said. It has enough supply to grow throughout this year, and some segments like data center won’t be hurt by chip shortages, he added.

Revenue will be about $5.3 billion in the period ending in April, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $4.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The chipmaker is seeing a surge in orders for PC gaming gear from consumers stuck at home in the pandemic and looking for entertainment. Nvidia’s graphics chips are also important components in machines that run the code needed to create Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months.

Huang has built on Nvidia’s strength in PC gaming graphics chips by taking the company into new markets such as artificial intelligence processing in data centers and components for autonomous vehicles.

Revenue from gaming was $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 67% from the same period last year.During previous run ups in the price of cryptocurrencies, Nvidia experienced surging demand followed by crashes sparked by price drops and the switch to more customized technology. The company has tried to minimize this volatility by offering different chips specifically for crypto mining. That reduces the risk that Nvidia’s gaming chips are dumped back into the market when crypto customers realized they don’t need them.

Last September, Nvidia agreed to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, in a bid to control of some of the most widely used electronics technology. The two are seeking regulatory approval around the world. Arm customers including Google, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are worried about the deal and have urged antitrust officials to intervene.

Fiscal fourth quarter revenue rose 61% to $5 billion and profit excluding certain costs was $3.10 a share in the period, which ended Jan. 31, the company said. Analysts, on average, predicted earnings of $2.81 a share on sales of $4.82 billion.

MYLES UDLAND: Let's stay on the economy and talk a bit more about everything happening in the markets. We're joined now by Kristen Bitterly. She is the regional head of investments for North America at Citi Private Bank. Kristen, thanks for joining the program this morning. I'd love to start with rates and what you guys are thinking about the signal we can reliably say is coming from the long end of the bond market and how you're trying to decompose some of those pressures that maybe have investors worried or maybe folks are just looking through.

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so the price action that we've seen obviously in broader markets and particularly within rates, this has been driving everything over the past couple of days. And this question about, OK, should we be worried about inflation, the curve steepening, what does that mean for growth stocks? And so in terms of how we've been positioned going into this, we've actually been pulling back from some of what we call the COVID defensive stocks that have really seen a run over the past 12 months and then rotating into what we call COVID cyclicals. So we've been doing that rotation. And we've also been positioning our portfolios in anticipation of some of this inflationary concern as well as rising rates.

Because as the data gets better-- So some of the things you were just talking about. So the consumer savings rate, the average savings rate in the US is twice the amount it was last year. As we think about this pent-up demand and when that actually, when the 15% of the global economy that's currently shut down, when that actually comes back online, what does that mean? So looking at our portfolios, basically, if you're looking at this curve steepening, what things are punitive? It's cash and duration.

Story continues

So where we're positioned right now is we're trying to find ways of augmenting income without taking on duration. And we're actually trying to convince people that cash is punitive. Because when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis, you're almost guaranteed to lose value.

- Well, seeing that people have seemingly been pouring money into lots of stuff that has a higher return, maybe they're getting that message that cash is punitive right now. I want to pick up on the discussion we were just having about consumer confidence. I don't know where in the world you are. But this sort of perception that maybe we're a little skewed here in the Northeast in terms of how open the economy is. Both anecdotally and the actual data, how optimistic are you in terms of economic growth right now?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: So I'm in the Northeast as well. So in terms of-- I'm here in Brooklyn. So in terms of my own perception of it, I can say that I definitely feel that that 15% of the global economy is still definitely shut down where it may be more open depending upon climate. I think that consumer confidence, we still see-- so, yes, there's certain parts of the market where people are pouring money into the market. And we've seen that. But we also do see that hesitancy in terms of getting invested. And so I can understand that consumer confidence kind of being right in the middle, that there is improving data, right? So you have this element of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines.

You also have more-- more vaccines coming to market, right, and more efficacious treatment. So this idea that you could see a summer that would be a little bit more normal I think is something that, that consumers are getting comfortable with. And they are starting to think about planning things like vacations and how basically they're going to be coming back to normal in a post-pandemic world. But we've seen spending-- so you guys were mentioning kind of the spending in terms of home improvements and the first time someone bought a drill.

We've seen that type of spending. But, obviously, there still is this pent-up demand. And there still is a pent up demand for all of those really heavy-hit COVID cyclical industries, which is something that will drive the consumer behavior, and I think ultimately something that will be a reinforcement of whether we actually see strong consumer confidence.

- Kristen, is too much being made out of the rise in 10-year yields? It's not as if the 10-year is at 4%. It's at 1.4%, remains very low historically. Are you at that point where 1.4% is triggering you to make changes in your portfolios?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: You know what I think the market is wrestling with right now? So when we look at the 10-year where it's at, we almost have to go back and say, look, the 10-year in December of 2019 was at 1.9%. So the economy was functioning very, very well. Technology and growth stocks were actually continuing to dominate the market and grow. And so I think what the market is wrestling with right now is whether this rotation that we're seeing, is it a rotation or is it catch-up of COVID cyclicals? So the price action that we see today, obviously, you're seeing some of that rotation. You're seeing financials perform very well. You're seeing tech hurt a little bit. But I think one of the questions that we're all struggling with is really kind of pivoting more to real earnings as opposed to expectations.

And so what I mean by that is yes, you can see why financials would perform well with the curve steepening. You can see parts of, once the economy reopens, those sectors actually doing particularly well. But I think one question on everyone's mind is so when you look at some of these companies that have been dominating the market-- so let's talk about the big five, right, so like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook-- when you look at them, they're right now around 18% of market cap. But they're 25% of earnings. And so in terms of representation from a contribution of earnings standpoint, you can almost make the argument that they're underrepresented. And so I think the focus and what everyone's going to be watching very closely is can these companies actually continue these really stellar earnings and continue to deliver even as we move to a post COVID-world?

MYLES UDLAND: Now Kristen, something you flagged to us is that all your clients or many of your clients are asking about if we're in a bubble. How that fits in here, I think everyone likes talking about it because the big fun word to say. And related to that also is the crypto conversation. All this speculation that happens, not just in financial markets, but tangential to financial markets, how are you guys talking through some of those concerns or maybe the FOMO, perhaps, that the [? senior ?] client base is having if they are not really allocated to those kinds of areas?

KRISTEN BITTERLY: Yeah, so are we-- the question about are we in a bubble and where to put capital to work, I think you always have to put it into perspective. My colleague Robert Buckland did a really great piece, an op-ed piece in the ""Financial Times"" that walked through just putting it into perspective compared to 2000, for example. And if we look at the price action not just over the past-- I think everyone's looking at this price action since March and since the depths of the pandemic. But if we take a step back and we actually look at over the past three years, what price action are we seeing in equity markets? Well, the past three years, you can say the NASDAQ is up 90%. So 30% per annum, that's actually very, very strong. We all would agree with that.

But going into the tech bubble, it was completely different. It was around 300%. US equities up around 36%, so 12% per annum. Once we got outside the US though, it's a very different story. So emerging markets up 12% over that time period, the DAX flat, UK equity is are actually negative over that same time period. So I think the one thing is when you're looking at, are we in a bubble? There are parts of the market that, yes, feel that way, look that way, seem overheated. And that's why I go back to, are they-- are these parts of the market, are they delivering on earnings or not?

And the other thing is to focus on, where haven't you seen some of the snapback? Where are you looking from a relative valuation standpoint that's attractive? And an example of that, global health care. So global health care, you would think in a pandemic, right, in a pandemic, health care would absolutely be rallying. But what we've seen is on a relative PE basis, it's at the lowest levels relative to global equities in about a decade.

So we like health care for a variety of reasons, not just because of the pandemic, but more of a demographic argument. But it's a strong sector, high free cash flow generating. So there's areas of the market where it makes a lot of sense to invest-- not only short term, but long term.

32,2021-02-24T15:43:34+00:00,IonQ in Talks to Go Public Through Merger with DMY SPAC,"(Bloomberg) -- IonQ is in advanced talks to merge with blank-check company DMY Technology Group Inc. III, according to people with knowledge of the matter, creating one of the first public quantum-computing firms.

The combined company is slated to be worth about $2 billion and a deal is set to be announced in coming weeks, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Silver Lake, MSD Partners, Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy and an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Co. are in talks to participate in a so-called strategic private investment in public equity, or PIPE.

Shares of the SPAC surged 15% at 10:24 a.m. in New York.

DMY Technology is discussing raising additional equity from institutional investors, and new equity from strategic and institutional investors is set to total around $300 million, one of the people said. Existing IonQ investors are expected to roll their equity into the transaction, according to one of the people.

As with any deal that hasn’t been finalized, it’s possible terms change or talks fall apart. Representatives for IonQ and DMY declined to comment, as did spokesmen for Silver Lake and MSD Partners. Representatives of Hyundai and Breakthrough Energy Ventures didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The SPAC, led by Chairman Harry You and Chief Executive Officer Niccolo De Masi, raised $300 million in November and said at the time it would pursue a target in consumer technology.

College Park, Maryland-based IonQ was founded in 2015 by Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim and is led by CEO Peter Chapman. Its investors include Amazon Web Services, Samsung Catalyst Fund, GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), NEA, Lockheed Martin Corp., Airbus Ventures and Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH. IonQ in October unveiled what it describes as the world’s most powerful quantum computer.

Quantum has long been touted as the next frontier in technology. Such computers would be capable of simulating and understanding phenomena in the natural world instantly and providing the basis for systems that are unhackable. Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp., among other companies, are also working to advance quantum computing. The technology also has potential implications for producing new materials or creating new drugs.

36,2021-02-23T23:39:23+00:00,"Senators, Tech Execs Recommend Hack Reporting Requirement","(Bloomberg) -- A bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday recommended that the U.S. consider requiring companies to disclose when they have been hacked.

At the first public hearing before Congress since a massive cyber-attack by suspected Russian hackers was disclosed in December, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat, was joined by the vice chairman of the committee, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, in calling for the measure. Several others, including Senator Angus King, an independent, also voiced their support, as did several of the tech executives who were testifying.

There is currently no federal data breach notification law.

“It is time, not only to talk about, but to find a way to take action to impose in an appropriate manner, some kind of notification obligation on entities in the private sector,” said Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith. “I think it is the only way we’re going to protect the country, and I think it is the only way we’re going to protect the world.”

FireEye Inc. Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mandia said he supported a requirement that companies notify an appropriate government agency about being hacked. But he urged that it be confidential, to encourage companies to participate amid liability concerns.

The hearing before Warner’s committee on Tuesday included Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the CEO of SolarWinds Corp. -- the Texas-based software firm that the hackers compromised as part of the attack. He told the committee that the tool hackers used to compromise the company’s software “poses a grave risk of automated supply chain attacks” across the software industry.

The senators mostly used a light touch in questioning Ramakrishna -- who started at SolarWinds in January after the hack was disclosed -- about his company’s responsibility in the massive cyber-attack. He said his company is investigating three possible ways the attackers may have used to gain access to the company’s networks but haven’t reached a conclusion.

Story continues

The senators were much tougher on Amazon Web Services for not appearing at the hearing despite an invitation. According to SolarWinds, its Orion software platform -- which was compromised by the hackers -- could be deployed by customers on AWS among other cloud platforms.

“The operation we will be discussing today used their infrastructure, at least in part,” Rubio said. “Apparently they were too busy to discuss that here today.”

Amazon.com Inc. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The hackers responsible for the incident inserted malicious code into SolarWinds’s software, which was delivered to as many as 18,000 customers through software updates, though fewer are believed to have been targeted with additional hacking.

The White House has confirmed that the hackers leveraged this access to breach more than 100 companies and nine U.S. agencies with follow-on hacking aimed at espionage.

Mandia, of FireEye, said the attackers were “exceptionally hard to detect.” He added that the hackers appeared to be highly concerned with remaining hidden. “The minute you could detect these folks and stopped them breaking through the door, they sort of evaporated like ghosts until their next operation.”

FireEye discovered the hacking campaign while investigating a breach of its own networks. Mandia said in his prepared remarks that the company found an intrusion in late November and determined that a third-party had accessed their network without authorization. FireEye disclosed the cyber-attack in December.

Smith told the committee that Microsoft’s threat hunters and engineers analyzed the attack and estimated there were 1,000 developers who worked on the attack. “It is the largest and most sophisticated operation of this sort that we’ve seen,” he said.

Another witness at the hearing, George Kurtz, the co-founder and CEO of Crowdstrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by SolarWinds for incident response, called for improvements to federal cybersecurity. He said old computer systems and compliance rules “detract from their core security work.”

While a mandatory data breach notification law is one mechanism by which Congress could improve U.S. cybersecurity, the prospects of passing such a law in 2021 are slim given competing Covid-19 relief priorities, according to Dominique Shelton Leipzig, a privacy and cybersecurity attorney at Perkins Coie LLP.

“Realistically, the chances of getting a federal omnibus privacy and data security law are looking more likely to happen next year,” she said.

Businesses want a federal law since they currently have to comply with differing data breach notification laws in all 50 states, she said. “This is the perfect example where companies are calling out for guidance both on the privacy and data security side,” she said.

SolarWinds’ software was breached to break into a host of other organizations. CrowdStrike is assisting SolarWinds to recover from the breach. The exact scope of the breach is wider than estimated as different company executives try to keep their role in the cyberespionage campaign a secret. Microsoft has urged cyberattack victims to share information towards the resolution of the threat. A Russian government hacker group named APT29 or Cozy Bear was allegedly responsible for the attack last year. The hack was hard to perceive and difficult to undo as per the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Microsoft admitted that malicious software in its system with certain Microsoft Azure cloud services systems might have been compromised. The company also confirmed the removal of malicious Solar Winds binaries from their environment. The hack could not have come at a worse time than when the U.S. government was battling increased online vulnerability, with most officials working from home amidst the pandemic and accessing sensitive applications and data from global endpoints.

40,2021-02-23T19:00:58+00:00,It’s ‘not necessarily the greatest environment for government bonds’: Strategist,"Brian Jacobsen, Multi-Asset Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, joins Yahoo Finance’s Kristin Myers to reflect on the rise in yields and how investors should be reallocating their portfolios amid tech sell-off.

Video Transcript

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, market action right now, again, remains in the red as we see big tech sell off, NASDAQ down about 2 and 3/10 of a percentage point. As we've been talking about investors rotating out of some of those big tech names, we are seeing Tesla taking a huge hit today in the red. You can see right there some of those tech stocks under pressure, Tesla down over 5% right now, Apple down also 2.7%, and Zoom right now down over 5%.

We've got Brian Jacobsen here with us. He's a Wells Fargo Asset Management multi-asset strategist. Brian, always good to have you with us. So let's start with what Jay Powell was talking about today, again, soothing some of these fears around inflation, and yesterday, when talking about the rising bond yields. UBS's Tom McLoughlin said to us that this was transitory, echoing some of what we heard from Powell today. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on this.

BRIAN JACOBSEN: Yeah, so obviously, there's been quite the move up in yields. And unfortunately, it's been in the yields that are probably most relevant to helping support this economic recovery. Right, a lot of people look at the overnight rate for the federal funds rate, and it's not that relevant to them. But when you see it showing up in the 10-year Treasury yield or mortgage rates, then it becomes real. And you can understand why these move ups in yields can really give some investors a little moment of pause.

But Chair Powell seems to suggest, which we agree, is that the yields have moving up for kind of a good reason. Initially, it was rising inflation expectations. That seems relatively contained. But now it's more because of the better growth outlook. So our big concern is whether or not we have moved up too far, too fast, at least for the market to be able to digest it. Maybe that's why we've had a bit of a pullback in the last couple of days. But as long as we don't go up too much higher than where we are, let's say 1.5% on the 10-year Treasury, it shouldn't really be too much of a headwind for the broader economic recovery.

Story continues

KRISTIN MYERS: And the 10-year right now holding steady, just below 1.4 now. I see that 1.5 is that level that you got-- that you are giving us right now. What are you thinking in terms of timing either for the markets to kind of digest some of this news as you were saying, or for investors really to go back into the markets and for some of those yields to come down?

BRIAN JACOBSEN: Well, we think that from a time frame perspective here, that it's really about what's next for the Fed, the next speech. Obviously, we'd like it if it was tied to the calendar, as to when their next meeting is. Oftentimes, it's the slip of the tongue that tends to move yields either up or down. If you remember back to 2013 with then chair Ben Bernanke, the famous taper tantrum just because he said in a speech, at some point, we're going to be stopping this asset purchase program not now, not tomorrow, but at some point in the future. And the market sold off on that, yields rose.

We think that the Federal Reserve is going to be very careful in trying to craft and control their messaging around that. So we think that we could see maybe a slow grind higher with yields. Which makes us very optimistic about the outlook for equities. Not necessarily the greatest environment for government bonds, but we think it's actually very good for equities and for the more what are called the credit sensitive parts of the market, like high yield bonds and lower quality investment grade debt.

KRISTIN MYERS: Looking out at equities over the rest of the year, of course, we saw big tech under pressure today, and we've kept hearing that big tech probably isn't going to be leading the market in 2021. So for some of our investors out there, especially some of the folks that really got in during the pandemic, how should they be thinking about reallocating their portfolios in this current environment?

BRIAN JACOBSEN: The way that we're trying to coach our clients and the way that we're managing our clients' money is to really try to pivot more into those parts of the market that have underperformed, not just over the last year, but really, if you think about it, the last, say, five years or even the last 10 years. Is there some maybe valuation catch-up that can happen?

That would be more with what are called the value part of the spectrum. So if you think about, like, financials and industrials, companies that typically trade at lower market multiples-- so the earnings per share relative to their market prices-- those have underperformed over the last 10 years or so. And so those are areas that we find very attractive and should benefit, we think, from a continued economic improvement.

But then there's also a broad net when you look outside of the United States, as far as emerging markets and even in Europe and Japan. And so, for us, we're encouraging clients to continue to sort of lean into those parts of the market that most underperformed because we believe that the economic fundamentals are improving, and that this isn't just some sort of ephemeral one to two-year bounce in growth, that this actually has a lot of legs to it.

KRISTIN MYERS: All right, Brian Jacobsen, Wells Fargo Asset Management multi-strategist, thanks so much-- multi-asset strategist, excuse me-- thanks so much for joining us today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/not-necessarily-greatest-environment-government-190058605.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'EEM.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'IHSEF.US', 'MSFT.US', 'TSLA.US', 'XLF.US', 'ZM.US']","['BOND YIELDS', 'JACOBSEN']","{'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.095}"

By Raphael Satter and Joseph Menn

WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Top executives at Texas-based software company SolarWinds Corp, Microsoft Corp and cybersecurity firms FireEye Inc and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc defended their conduct in breaches blamed on Russian hackers and sought to shift responsibility elsewhere in testimony to a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday.

All four were victims in one of the worst hacks yet discovered, affecting about 100 U.S. companies and nine federal agencies. SolarWinds and Microsoft programs were used to attack others.

The executives argued for greater transparency and information-sharing about breaches, with liability protections and a system that does not punish those who come forward, similar to airline disaster investigations.

Microsoft President Brad Smith and others told the U.S. Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence that the true scope of the latest intrusions is still unknown, because most victims are not legally required to disclose attacks unless they involve sensitive information about individuals.

Also testifying were FireEye Chief Executive Kevin Mandia, whose company was the first to discover the hackers, SolarWinds Chief Executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna, whose company's software was hijacked by the spies to break in to a host of other organizations, and CrowdStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz, whose company is helping SolarWinds recover from the breach.

""It's imperative for the nation that we encourage and sometimes even require better information-sharing about cyberattacks,"" Smith said.

Smith said many techniques used by the hackers have not come to light and that “the attacker may have used up to a dozen different means of getting into victim networks during the past year.""

Microsoft disclosed last week that the hackers had been able to read the company's closely guarded source code for how its programs authenticate users. At many of the victims, the hackers manipulated those programs to access new areas inside their targets.

Story continues

Smith stressed that such movement was not due to programming errors on Microsoft's part but on poor configurations and other controls on the customer's part, including cases ""where the keys to the safe and the car were left out in the open.""

In CrowdStrike’s case, hackers used a third-party vendor of Microsoft software, which had access to CrowdStrike systems, and tried but failed to get into the company’s email.

CrowdStrike's Kurtz turned the blame on Microsoft for its complicated architecture, which he called “antiquated.”

“The threat actor took advantage of systemic weaknesses in the Windows authentication architecture, allowing it to move laterally within the network” and reach the cloud environment while bypassing multifactor authentication, Kurtz’s prepared statement said.

Where Smith appealed for government help in providing remedial instruction for cloud users, Kurtz said Microsoft should look to its own house and fix problems with its widely used Active Directory and Azure.

“Should Microsoft address the authentication architecture limitations around Active Directory and Azure Active Directory, or shift to a different methodology entirely, a considerable threat vector would be completely eliminated from one of the world’s most widely used authentication platforms,” Kurtz said.

Alex Stamos, a former Facebook and Yahoo security chief now consulting for SolarWinds, agreed with Microsoft that customers who split their resources between their own premises and Microsoft's cloud are especially at risk, since skilled hackers can move back and forth, and should move wholly to the cloud.

But he added in an interview, ""It's also too hard to run (cloud software) Azure ID securely, and the complexity of the product creates many opportunities for attackers to escalate privileges or hide access.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top executives at Texas-based software company SolarWinds Corp, Microsoft Corp and cybersecurity firms FireEye Inc and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc defended their conduct in breaches blamed on Russian hackers and sought to shift responsibility elsewhere in testimony to a U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday.

One of the worst hacks yet discovered had an impact on all four. SolarWinds and Microsoft programs were used to attack others and the hack struck at about 100 U.S. companies and nine federal agencies.

Lawmakers started the hearing by criticizing Amazon representatives, who they said were invited to testify and whose servers were used to launch the cyberattack, for declining to attend the hearing.

""I think they have an obligation to cooperate with this inquiry, and I hope they will voluntarily do so,"" said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican. ""If they don't, I think we should look at next steps.""

The executives argued for greater transparency and information-sharing about breaches, with liability protections and a system that does not punish those who come forward, similar to airline disaster investigations.

Feb 23 (Reuters) - Top executives at Texas-based software company SolarWinds, digital giant Microsoft and cybersecurity firms FireEye and CrowdStrike are expected on Tuesday to defend their companies' responses to a sprawling series of breaches blamed on Russian hackers when they face the U.S. Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence.

The four are expected to argue for more - or even mandatory - transparency in the national response against cyberespionage, which has long been hobbled by secrecy and a widespread reluctance to identify publicly as victims of hacking.

The four companies are key players in the response against a spectacular set of intrusions that have allowed alleged Russian spies to run amok across American networks, compromising a total of nine federal agencies and 100 private-sector companies in what Microsoft's president Brad Smith described as the ""largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.""

Smith was among those to testify on Tuesday. The others were FireEye chief executive Kevin Mandia, whose company was the first to discover the hackers, SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna, whose company's software was hijacked by the spies to break into a host of other organizations, and CrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz, whose company is helping SolarWinds recover from the breach.

They and others have hinted that the true scope of the breaches is far wider than is publicly known, in part because embarrassed executives at other companies are trying to keep their role in the cyberespionage campaign a secret.

According to an excerpt of his testimony released in advance, Microsoft's Smith is expected to say that ""too many cyberattack victims keep information to themselves. We will not solve this problem through silence.

""It's imperative for the nation that we encourage and sometimes even require better information-sharing about cyberattacks,"" the excerpt said.

44,2021-02-23T15:19:29+00:00,Remote Work Had Several Implications For Dropbox Earnings,"Despite its increased importance in the new ‘home office' normal, the document storage and cloud segment has been largely ignored compared to the likes of Zoom Video (NASDAQ: ZM), DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU) and Fastly (NYSE: FSLY).

Last Thursday, Dropbox (NASDAQ: DBX) showed how much it benefited from the work-from-home trend as it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue. Quarterly sales topped $500 million for the first time as revenue improved 13% but Dropbox suffered a $400 million real estate hit as it sought to make remote work more permanent.

Fourth quarter

Revenue of $504.1 billion brought in adj anusted net income of $117.9 million, or 28 cents a share. In the same period a year ago, earnings were 16 cents a share on sales of $446 million.

The remote work trend

Before Dropbox committed to having its people work remotely, technology companies including Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) had said they would allow employees to continue working from home even after the pandemic subsides. Earlier this month, San Francisco's biggest employer, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) said that most of its employees will be in offices one to three days per week once it's safe enough to return, In October, after thousands of its employees had gotten used to working without being next to their colleagues, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) said it had agreed to pay $89.5 million to stop a lease for 490,000 square feet of office space near its San Francisco headquarters to avoid paying at least $440 million in rent.

Dropbox's ""Virtual First""

Last quarter, Dropbox announced is ""Virtual First"" strategy that makes remote work primary. At the end of third quarter, the company had over $1 billion in total lease liabilities on its balance sheet which includes assets other than just office space, so from an investment perspective, the cost savings could significantly boost profit margins. Dropbox stated that trimming 11% of its workforce was part of the ""Virtual First"" strategy to increase operational efficiency.

Story continues

The Impairment Charge

The one-time impairment charge of ""right-of-use and other lease related assets""amounted to $398.2 million. Dropbox is known for its lavish office space in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood but going forward, only the tasks that require collaboration between team members will be executed in Dropbox Studios.

During the first three quarters of 2020, Dropbox generated a net income ending its years-long losing streak. But the impairment charge that Dropbox disclosed reverses that streak, resulting in a nearly $346 million loss, compared to third quarter's profit of $33 million. The charge was excluded from non-GAAP results which showed an annualized increase in profit.

Dropbox ended the year with strong margin expansion, free cash flow, and more than $2 billion in ARR as itcontinued to make progress toward its long-term financial targets.

Customers

Putting all those millions that downloaded Dropbox aside, the company's revenue depends on users that pay for its premium services. A big concern is the potential for those individuals and businesses to churn to the titans such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) or Microsoft, (NASDAQ: MSFT) that can easily undercut them on price. But a steady march up in customer count should continue to alleviate these concerns and Dropbox's average revenue per user (ARPU) is a good indicator of the company's pricing power.

Dropbox ended the quarter with 15.48 million paying users, compared to 14.31 million for the same period last year, up 8.2% on a YoY basis. In the previous, third, quarter that ended last September, paying customers grew to 15.25 million as they were 14 million in Q3 of 2019. Increases in paying users drove growth as ARPU stood at $130.17 for the quarter, up 4.14% YoY.

Cash Flow

Dropbox's measures profitability with free cash flow or more precisely, by deducting capital investments from cash generated from business operations. Management's long-term goal is $1 billion in annual free cash flow by the fiscal year 2024. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $158.4 million compared to third quarter's $187 million.

From operations, Dropbox generated cash flow of $570.8 million in 2020 compared to $528.5 million in 2019. Free cash flow for 2020 was $490.7 million compared to $392.4 million reported in 2019. The company will have to continue working hard if it is to hit its 2024 free cash flow guidance.

New products

Dropbox has integrated several new products such as HelloSign, a digital signature company it acquired in 2019 for $230 million. Notably, HelloSign witnessed strong traction in the fourth quarter as it witnessed a 70% increase in end user signature requests.

Perhaps the most important updates released in November with the progress of Dropbox Spaces 2.0. that aims to provide users a virtual workspace in a home office environment. Spaces is Dropbox's key tool in winning customers in a post-pandemic world.

Outlook

Overall, the next year will be crucial for for the cloud-based storage and workflow management company. The company is sitting on an increase in demand for its cloud-based management tools due to the global transition to distributed work environments. Going into 2021, the company is focused on executing its strategy and building essential products for the new era of distributed work. Dropbox shares have risen about 20% since the company last reported earnings on November 5th. But only time will tell if it can succeeded winning new customers over its many strong competitors.

45,2021-02-23T11:00:00+00:00,SolarWinds Hack Grabs Senate Spotlight With CEO in the Hot Seat,"(Bloomberg) -- The suspected Russian hackers who compromised software created by SolarWinds Corp. to break into American agencies and companies used a cyber weapon “so potentially powerful it could have been crippling,” according to Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, called the hacking campaign “a level of attack and level of penetration that is much greater than what we have seen” in previous cyber-attacks on the U.S. His comments came during a Monday interview with Bloomberg News, a day before executives from key technology companies, including SolarWinds, testify before his committee about the sprawling breach.

Warner’s committee will convene on Tuesday afternoon for the first public hearing on the attack, which was disclosed in December. It will hear testimony from Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the president and chief executive officer of SolarWinds, and Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, in addition to Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. CEO George Kurtz and Kevin Mandia, CEO of FireEye Inc. -- the firm that first detected and disclosed the cyber-attack in December.

While the attack appears to have been carried out for the purposes of espionage, Warner warned that the hackers had the capability to use the compromised software in a destructive manner, allowing them to “potentially shut down a number of these enterprises.”

The hackers who perpetrated the attack delivered malicious software updates to as many as 18,000 SolarWinds’s customers. Using this access, they broke into the networks at least nine federal agencies, including the departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy. In addition, approximately 100 private-sector companies were breached, according to the White House -- which is leading an ongoing investigation into the breach and has yet to determine its full scale.

The attackers exhibited sophistication and patience, SolarWinds’ Ramakrishna said in Monday remarks at a virtual conference hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The hackers practiced their techniques on older and less-scrutinized servers before installing malicious code in more current updates that were being actively downloaded by customers, he said.

If you want to skip our discussion of the growth of the cloud computing industry and recent trends in the sector, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Cloud Computing Companies.

When venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote his prescient essay titled ""Software Is Eating the World"" in 2011, many thought he was overreacting to the information technology boom. Today, software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. At the core of this software revolution is Cloud. Companies are swiftly migrating to Cloud platforms to save costs, increase efficiency and accessibility. Interestingly, Andreessen had mention the rise of Cloud computing in his essay.

In 2000, when my partner Ben Horowitz was CEO of the first cloud computing company, Loudcloud, the cost of a customer running a basic Internet application was approximately $150,000 a month. Running that same application today in Amazon's cloud costs about $1,500 a month.

The pandemic has accelerated the current trends in technology, hastening the adoption of certain innovations. For instance, the work-from-home trend fueled the demand for software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based solutions. Microsoft Teams reported a huge increase in the number of active users, from 44 million active users in March 2020 to 115 million daily users in October 2020.

Investors Pouring Money Into Cloud

Investors are also pouring money into the Cloud computing startups amid huge growth prospects and low risk factors involved. According to CB Insights, the number of deals in the cloud computing space reached 97 during the second quarter of 2020, up from 76 during the same period in 2019. Investors funneled about $3 billion into Cloud startups from April to June 2020.

Companies prefer to use Cloud solutions instead of using legacy hardware or software. However, security has been a major concern for companies that want to move to Cloud platforms. But several startups are racing to solve that problem. For example, Massachusetts-based startup Snyk Inc helps developers detect vulnerabilities in Cloud applications and resolve them. The company has raised over $400 million from investors. Similarly, Cockroach Labs that helps companies manage their data architecture over Cloud, raised over $86 million in Series E in January 2021 and was valued at about $2 billion.

47,2021-02-23T00:00:00+00:00,"Lithium Prices Soar As Tesla, Apple And Google Fight For Supply","The electric vehicle (EV) revolution is gaining serious momentum.

According to experts’ projections, demand for electric vehicles should rise at a 21.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) until 2026.

The extraordinary demand that is forecast for EVs over the next five years has now begun to trigger a massive disruption in the global energy markets.

As demand for EVs continues to move higher, the demand for lithium – the critical component needed for the batteries that power all those EVs – is also projected to climb higher.

According to Roskill Information Services, “lithium chemical demand from end-use sectors is expected to increase year-on-year to around 280,000 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent.”

These projections have already begun to have a profound impact on the price of lithium in the marketplace.

Lithium prices declined from 2018 through the end of 2020, but since December 1, 2020 the price of lithium has soared 71.24% -- and could be poised to climb even higher.

With rising lithium prices and soaring projected demand, what are some of the best ways for investors to play this EV-powered trend for maximum upside potential?

With rising lithium prices and soaring projected demand, what is the best high risk/reward way for investors to play this EV-powered trend for maximum upside potential?

One under-the-radar company, United Lithium Corp., appears that it could be at the right place at the right time.

Its flagship project is a recently discovered lithium deposit located in central Sweden. The company has agreed on terms to acquire the project, with closing expected by April.

This project is a near-surface, near-market, exploration-stage lithium property that appears poised to help the company take advantage of Europe’s soaring demand for electric vehicles, and the EU’s strong push for lithium self-sufficiency.

United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby Project: A Near-Surface, High-Grade Deposit Offering Significant Upside Potential

Story continues Sweden

The Bergby project is a recently discovered lithium-rich pegmatite deposit in central Sweden that offers an ideal location.

This property is near to the world-famous Woxna graphite mine, the new Northvolt lithium battery gigafactory and close to major mining and transportation infrastructure, workforce and equipment suppliers.

The Bergby project, if proven up as a commercial deposit, is optimally positioned to benefit from access to the EU market and its growing demand for alternative energy vehicle manufacturing, high tech devices and grid storage systems.

In addition, the project’s proximity to next-generation lithium-ion battery manufacturing plants is critical, as is access to nearby EU educational institutions and low power costs for processing hard rock lithium-bearing minerals cost-effectively.

The Bergby lithium property should be able to capitalize on three key elements:

1. Probable low cost surface and near-surface extraction...

2. Well-established mining and transportation infrastructure, and...

3. Rapid fulfillment of trade regulations allowing tariff-free sales to potential EU lithium customers.

But the location of the Bergby lithium project is only part of the story of its potential.

Historic Sampling Shows Extensive Lithium Mineralization

Mapping and sampling of United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby property site defined an extensive field largely comprising boulders with abundant lithium-bearing minerals. Assayu

Assay results from 41 boulders shows Li2O (lithium oxide) values averaged 1.06% within a range from 0.03% to 4.56% Li2O; and Ta2O5 (tantalum pentoxide) assays averaged 168ppm, ranging from 1 ppm to 499 ppm Ta2O5.

Further mapping located lithium mineralization in outcrops. Fifteen samples collected from three outcrops returned Li2O values averaging 1.71%, ranging from 0.01% to 4.65% Li2O; and Ta2O5 values averaging 133 ppm within a range from 16 ppm to 803 ppm Ta2O5.

In 2017, the first and only drill program was completed at the Bergby project.

In that drilling program, 28 of the 33 holes drilled on the property intersected lithium mineralization along approximately 450m strike length.

The deepest holes tested to only 65m below surface with mineralization is still open along strike in both directions and well as down dip.

Three principal styles of lithium mineralization have been observed in widely -spread boulders and outcrops at the Bergby property, providing encouragement that mineralization may be extensively developed.

1. Homogeneous, fine grained to medium-grained leucogranite/aplite: Complex zoned boulders where the aplite material appears to intrude coarse-grained pegmatite. This style is rich in tantalum, with an average grade from 31 boulders of 208 ppm Ta2O5. The lithium mineralogy of this style is not yet confirmed, however, the measured specific gravity of highest-grade samples was relatively light and suggests petalite is a dominant mineral (LiAlSi4O10).

2. Petalite dominated extremely coarse-grained pegmatite: Located in both outcrop and boulders; this style is relatively high in lithium and poor in tantalum.

3. Spodumene-bearing, very coarse grained pegmatite: Coarse spodumene crystals (LiAl(SiO3)2 have been recognized in boulders, with crystals up to 30 cm in length.

What’s Next for United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby Project

The European Union has sounded the alarm on critical raw materials shortages, estimating that to meet its climate neutrality goal, it will need up to 18 times more lithium and five times more cobalt in 2030 than current consumption.

By 2050, the EU estimates that it will need a staggering 60 times more lithium than current demand.

For this reason, the EU has added lithium to its critical materials list and launched a multi-billion dollar fund to help speed the production of raw materials to supply the European battery market.

This means there is potential for significant capital available for projects such as United Lithium Corp.’s Bergby project as the scope of the project comes into focus.

Now that a discovery has been made at Bergby, the next task for United Lithium is to define the overall size and grade of the lithium and tantalum resource on the property.

The deposit at Bergby is open along the strike to the north and south...and there are additional known pegmatites in the area that have never been tested for lithium mineralization.

A simple drill program on the property of another 25 to 40 holes could be hugely impactful for the company in a relatively short period of time.

It’s possible that such a modest drilling program – one that the company has the financial resources to undertake – could be completed within the year with the goal of uncovering a discovery of several million tonnes at the property.

Bottom Line: Why the Future Could Be Bright for United Lithium Corp.

* Demand for lithium is soaring – and the price of lithium has shot up 71.24% in the last two months. With the worldwide shift toward electric vehicles in full swing, the world is desperately seeking to bring new supplies of lithium online...and the markets are likely to reward any company that can do so handsomely.

* United Lithium is a company whose primary asset showing lithium mineralization is in the right place at the right time, as the Bergby project’s location in Sweden is near the new Northvolt lithium battery gigafactory and close to transportation infrastructure.

* Drilling at the Bergby project has shown an extensive lithium-mineralized surface boulder field. 28 of the 33 holes drilled on the property in a 2017 drill program intersected lithium mineralization and the project showed potential high-grade, near-surface lithium potential.

* The company plans to move forward with an additional drill program in 2021 that could potentially reveal a lithium deposit discovery on the property. Positive results from this drill program could be a true game-changer for the company with Europe – and battery companies – so desperate to bring new lithium sources on line as quickly as possible.

Other companies dependent on the battery boom:

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leader in Big Tech’s sustainability push…but it’s more than just that. From the products themselves, to the packages they came in, and even the data centers powering them, Apple has gone above and beyond to cut the environmental impact.

But now, it’s even getting into the transportation business. ""We're focusing on autonomous systems. It's a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on."" Apple CEO Tim Cook on Apple's plans in the car space. Electric vehicles aren’t likely to be left out, either…

Apple's rumored car design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech giant that creates everything from software to hardware and more. This is important because not only does it help companies with exploration of minerals, it relies on them just as much. Microsoft is a company that is also going above and beyond in its emissions goals, aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. A feat that will not be an easy task for such a massive technology corporation. Why does that matter in the lithium race? Because the green energy boom will be destroyed without the vital metal

That’s why Bill Gates’ tech giant has made numerous investments in clean energy across the globe. From Ohio to the Netherlands, Microsoft is pouring millions into solar and wind projects to not only help reduce its own carbon footprint but also help neighboring communities do the same.

In addition to its investments and green operations, Microsoft is also getting into the auto-game. Microsoft’s Azure cloud-based infrastructure and edge computing is going to be pivotal in this new industry. Not only will it allow automakers to analyze data and optimize their products, but it will also give them the opportunity to conduct advanced tests and simulations to fine-tune their software in risk-free environments. It’s even partnering with leaders in the auto industry such as Renault and Audi.

Mark Everest, Information Systems Development Manager, Renault Sport Formula One Team noted, “There are so many factors that are constantly changing and can affect race strategy: track temperature, tire performance, what the other drivers are doing. Simulation helps us quickly understand how to configure the car for a particular track.""

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made major progress towards a more sustainable tomorrow. And as a chipmaker, it is reliant on the production of key metals and minerals such as copper and lithium. But what makes NVIDIA even more special is that it is tackling the ESG trend on all fronts. In fact, it was ranked as one of the world’s top 100 companies to work for due to its incredible working conditions, hiring practices and professional development programs. In addition to its ranking as one of the world’s top companies to work for, it was also ranked on MIT Tech Review’s 50 Smartest Companies list and the Human Rights Watch’s Corporate Equality Index.

Not only is Nvidia a role model for companies in its social and governance stance, it is also firmly committed to building a greener future, as well. From its push to use renewable energy in its day to day operations to its innovative technological advancements in chipmaking which reduce the amount of energy needed to power devices, Nvidia is checking all boxes for impact investors.

This year, Nvidia has done something that many other companies have struggled to do. Not only has it stayed afloat in one of the most trying years in recent history, it has thrived. Since January 2020, Nvidia’s share price has increased from $293 to $525, representing a noteworthy 80% increase in value.

While electric vehicles are the talk of Wall Street right now, autonomous vehicles are on the horizon as well, and they too will rely on a number of key metals and resources. And the leader in this push is Waymo, a subsidy of tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Waymo may just be the de facto leader in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry. It’s already had cars driving themselves across the United States for several years. In fact, in Arizona alone, Alphabet’s self-driving cars have logged over 6.1 million miles. To put that in perspective, that means that Alphabet’s autonomous cars have driven the distance between New York City and San Francisco over 2100 times. Or, as the company explains, “over 500 years of driving for the average licensed US driver.” Even more impressive, however, the vehicles were only involved in 47 “contact events”, and the vast-majority of the collisions were the result of human error and none resulted in any sort of severe injury for anyone involved.

While these tests are extremely promising for Alphabet’s Waymo, there are still some hurdles to overcome. First and foremost, these lengthy trials took place in Phoenix, a city not exactly known for extreme weather. Second, an issue that may frustrate many drivers, the vehicles operated in a sort of hyper-cautious mode, driving at slower speeds and taking sometimes unnecessary precautions to avoid conflict.

While Alphabet’s Waymo gets a lot of credit for these massive accomplishments, a widely loved and wildly popular chipmaker is at its core. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Waymo teamed up way back in 2017, and have worked together to fine tune their technology together ever since. Through their mutual knowledge of hardware and software, the tech giants have made leaps and bounds towards building the car of the future.

In addition to its efforts with Waymo, Intel has also been on the forefront of developing its own artificial intelligence and vision hardware. Back in 2017, it acquired MobileEye, a supplier of camera-based chips and software to the global mobile industry. And now, in a new deal with Luminar, another emerging tech company on the forefront of this movement, Intel is positioning itself as its own giant of this new sector.

Canada’s Silicon Valley is all in on the sustainability race, too. Shopify Inc (TSX:SH) Canada’s own e-commerce giant helps users build their own online stores. It has huge clients – everyone from Tesla to Budweiser are on board. And the company is beloved by millennial investors. In addition to its revolutionary approach on e-commerce, Shopify is playing an increasingly active role in creating a greener tomorrow. It has committed to spending at least $5 million annually to help combat climate change. It’s even making cuts throughout its own operations, decommissioning its data centers and sourcing renewable power for its buildings. Thanks the these efforts, Shopify has posted a return of 137% this year alone, and is showing no signs of slowing.

The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (TSX:DSG) is a Canadian multinational technology company specializing in logistics software, supply chain management software, and cloud-based services for logistics businesses. Recently, Descartes announced that it has successfully deployed its advanced capacity matching solution, Descartes MacroPoint Capacity Matching. The solution provides greater visibility and transparency within their network of carriers and brokers. This move could solidify the company as a key player in transportation logistics which is essential-and-often-overlooked in the mitigation of rising carbon emissions.

Another way to get some indirect exposure to the booming tech, EV and mineral industries is through AutoCanada (TSX:ACQ), a company that operates auto-dealerships through Canada. The company carries a wide variety of new and used vehicles and has all types of financial options available to fit the needs of any consumer. While sales have slumped this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AutoCanada will likely see a rebound as both buying power and the demand for electric vehicles increases. As more new exciting EVs hit the market, AutoCanada will surely be able to ride the wave.

Burcon NutraScience Corporation (TSX:BU) is a Canadian tech firm rethinking the our diets. And while that may not seem exciting for minerals investors, it is a key stock to watch in the wider sustainability boom. With a focus on high-purity, sustainable, flavorful, and affordable products, Burcon has checked every box in the consumer’s book. Founded way back in 1998, the company has been at the forefront of the movement for over two decades, and it’s only become more refined since.

According to its mission statement, Burcon “seeks to improve the health and wellness of global consumers through the discovery and development of sustainable, functional and renewable plant-based products for the global food and beverage industries.”

Mogo Finance Technology Inc. (TSX:GO) is a new spin on unsecured credit, which is a burgeoning sub-segment of FinTech. Providing loan management, the ability to track spending, stress-free mortgages, and even credit score tracking, Mogo is at the forefront of an online movement to assist users with their financial needs.

Mogo’s software analyzes borrowers instantly and greatly reduces the traditionally cumbersome underwriting process for loans. It’s online only, so there’s very low overhead and a ton of cash to spend on marketing. Labeled as “the Uber of finance” by CNBC, Mogo is definitely turning heads.

With increasing membership growth and revenue lines continuing to improve, and a platform which many banks have failed to offer, Mogo could well become an acquisition target in the near future.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion of the investment philosophy of Lee Cooperman and the performance of his hedge fund Omega Advisors, go directly to Billionaire Lee Cooperman’s Top 5 Stock Picks.

Billionaire Leon “Lee” Cooperman had very humble beginnings as a plumber who grew up in a Jewish family in the Bronx. After graduating from the Columbia Business School in 1967, Cooperman joined Goldman Sachs and worked his way up to top roles like CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, CIO and head of GS Capital Growth Fund. He left the firm after 25 years and founded Omega Advisors, a $3.4 billion hedge fund based in New York City. In 2018, Leon Cooperman converted Omega Advisors to a family office. An early riser, Cooperman spent most of his life in Short Hills, New Jersey. Billionaire Lee Cooperman’s Top 10 Stock Picks

Leon Cooperman is one of the most respected figures in the financial world today with over $2.5 billion net worth as of February 21. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, Omega Advisors reported $1.39 billion in managed 13F securities. Its top 10 holdings account for about 61% of the total portfolio.

Leon Cooperman and GameStop (NYSE:GME) Cooperman sparked a stir recently following his angry comments during an interview with CNBC regarding the GameStop saga. The billionaire said that the GameStop crisis shows the weaknesses of the regulatory authorities. He also said that the “fair share is a bullshit concept” and a way of attacking wealthy people. The 77-year-old investor believes that there is “too much bullishness” in the market and he is also worried about the rising fiscal deficit and debt levels. In September 2016 the SEC charged the billionaire and Omega Advisors for insider trading related to Atlas Pipeline Partners. The hedge fund agreed to settle the charges for $4.9 million in 2017. Despite these controversies, Cooperman’s stock-picking strategy remains peerless. Omega Advisors generated more than 12% annualized returns since inception through 2018. Based on the 13F holdings data recently disclosed by Omega Advisors, let's first take a look at the fund's recent activity before diving into billionaire Leon Cooperman's top 10 stock picks.

Omega Advisors Sells Lee Enterprises and MVC Capital Inc

Omega Advisors recently disclosed its 13F holdings data for the fourth quarter of 2020. The fund sold its stakes in Lee Enterprises, Inc (NYSE:LEE) and MVC Capital Inc (NYSE:MVC)

Leon “Lee” Cooperman Slashes Stakes in AMCX, PE, MGY

Some notable companies in which the fund slashed its stakes include AMC Networks Inc. (-36%), Pioneer PE Holding Llc (-11%), and Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (-10%).

Omega Advisors is one of the biggest stakeholders of Mr. Cooper Group Inc. During the fourth quarter, the fund increased its stake in the company by 8%. COOP accounts for 11% of the overall portfolio of the hedge fund.

However, Omega Advisors significantly increased its stake in Gannett Co. Inc. (NYSE:GCI), upping its hold in the company by 47%.

While Leon Cooperman’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points. Our short strategy was also launched 4 years ago and its short recommendations gained a cumulative 8% (that’s a good thing because we are shorting them) since then.

Let’s take a look at Billionaire Lee Cooperman’s top 10 stock picks based on Omega Advisors’ 13F portfolio. But before that, here's an interesting quote from the the billionaire:

""The way to be successful is do what you love and love what you do. I get paid normally a lot of money for basically doing something I enjoy doing. And what I enjoy is to hunt—finding something somebody else doesn't see, making a bet and having Mr. Market prove me right,” Cooperman said in a 2014 interview.

10. Ferro Corporation (NYSE:FOE)

One of the largest producers of performance materials, Ferro Corporation was founded by Harry Cushman in 1919. The company began global operations in the 1930s and continued expanding decades after WWII. By 1994, the company had net sales of $1.2 billion and was already operating in 21 nations worldwide.

Ferro Corporation ranks 10th in the list of billionaire Lee Cooperman’s top 10 stock picks. FOE accounts for 3.49% of Omega Advisor’s overall portfolio. Shares in FOE rallied 5% over the last twelve months. Leon Cooperman’s fund owns 3.32 million shares of the company, worth $48 million. Overall, 12 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held positions in FOE as of the end of the fourth quarter.

Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, Ferro sales increased 18.1% over the second quarter of 2020.

9. WPX Energy Inc (NYSE:WPX)

One of the largest energy producers with core acreage positions in Permian and Williston basins, WPX Energy Inc is ranked as the ninth stock in our list of billionaire Lee Cooperman’s top 10 stock picks, accounting for 3.65% of Omega Advisors’ overall portfolio.

A total of 35 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held positions in WPX at the end of the fourth quarter.

In January 2021, WPX announced the successful completion of their all-stock merger of equals with Devon Energy Corporation. The merger will operate under the name Devon Energy with headquarters located in Oklahoma. In line with the agreement, WPX shareholders received a fixed exchange of 0.5165 shares of Devon common stock for each share of WPX common stock owned.

Diamond Hill Capital mentioned that WPX underperformed in its Q1 2020 investor letter:

“Oil and gas exploration and production company WPX Energy, Inc. underperformed after OPEC failed to reach a deal on output cuts and the coronavirus crisis sapped global demand for petroleum products.”

8. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)

MSFT stakes accounted for 3.93% of the Omega Advisors portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter. Leon Cooperman has been showing interest in MSFT since the 4th quarter of 2015. Omega Advisors owns 245,705 shares of MSFT as of the end of December, worth $54 million.

A total of 258 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock at the end of the fourth quarter. Martin Taylor’s Crake Asset Management is one of the top hedge funds having positions in MSFT, which had $176 billion invested in the stock at the end of December.

Schroder Investment Group mentioned MSFT in its Q4 2020 investor letter:

“The fund added to its holding in Microsoft Corporation (“MSFT”) during Q4. We view MSFT as a ‘growth staple’ capable of generating low and mid double-digit revenue and earnings growth respectively for a number of years, and find its valuation – PEs of 27x and 23x 2022 and 2023 earnings – attractive in the context of stock markets, given the durability of its growth, its high percentage of recurring revenues and its strong balance sheet.

Satya Nadella, MSFT’s superb CEO, has reinvigorated the company, by investing heavily in its cloud service, Azure, and in the subscription version of Office, O365, which, in both cases, has involved the necessary cannibalisation of very high margin (90%+) license sales, for less, but still profitable, recurring revenues. The company is now highly aligned with current trends in IT and scores strongly on metrics such as its technology vision and trends in future wallet share.

MSFT’s last two sets of results have been less stellar than before. Growth in commercial cloud has remained strong, but declines in the Office Commercial licensing business have accelerated, growth in Office 365 has slowed and revenues in Server & Tools and Windows OEM revenue turned negative, all likely reflecting higher SMB churn, free introductory O365 offers and very tough comps in Server & Tools due to the end of life of Windows Server 2008 and SQL 2008 in FY 2020. The company faces ‘tough comps‘ in the upcoming quarter but, beyond that, we see revenue and EBIT growth accelerating.

More importantly, we see plenty of evidence that secular trends such as cloud adoption and digital transformation are accelerating while MSFT’s positioning for these trends is improving. We expect the IT spending environment to remain sluggish and enterprises to consolidate to fewer vendors. The company’s value proposition is very appealing in this environment.

7. Ashland Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ASH)

The chemical provider, Ashland Global Holdings, Inc., ranks 7th in our list of billionaire Leon Cooperman’s top 10 stock picks, accounting for 4.57% in the overall Omega Advisors portfolio. Despite ASH underperforming in 2020, investors enjoyed significant dividends from the company. It currently offers a dividend yield of 1.28%.

At the end of the fourth quarter, 38 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database held long positions in ASH.

6. MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP)

The sustainable, low-cost supply chain of coveted materials, MP Materials Corp, is one of billionaire Leon Cooperman’s top 10 stock picks. MP accounts for 5.62% of the overall Omega Advisors portfolio with around $78 million invested in the stock.

Year to date, the stock is up over 30%. The increasing demand for electric vehicles is helping the company, as it is one of the major suppliers of rare magnets.

53,2021-02-22T13:00:06+00:00,Seattle Mints a New Unicorn: Salesforce-Backed Startup Highspot,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc.-backed Seattle startup Highspot, a maker of software for training and managing sales employees and content, raised $200 million, valuing the company at $2.3 billion.

The funding round was led by Tiger Global and included an investment from Bain & Co., as well as existing backers such as Salesforce Ventures and Madrona Venture Group. Highspot is now one of the most richly valued startups in Seattle, and is worth more than double its valuation when the company raised funds about 14 months ago.

Highspot’s software helps roll out training content for sales representatives, provides them coaching and playbooks, as well as organizing slide decks and marketing materials used to win over customers. The software, used by companies like General Motors Co. and Nestle SA, tracks which materials are most effective for which clients, logging what gets read and to what extent. The idea is to help clients convert the strategy and plans executives have in their head into something companies can sell, said Highspot Chief Executive Officer Robert Wahbe.

“There's a famous Harvard Business Review article that 70% of strategic initiatives don’t work,” said Wahbe, a former Microsoft Corp. executive. “Sometimes it’s not because the strategy isn’t right, it’s because they can’t translate it to the actions taken every day by their frontline sales team. We allow them to do that.”

The company wouldn’t disclose precise sales metrics, but Wahbe said annualized recurring revenue has risen 900% in the past three years. The new funds will be used to hire more engineers and fuel an overseas expansion — Highspot wants to enter the Asia Pacific market and start an outpost in France after recently opening offices in London and Munich. Prior to the current round, Highspot had raised a total of $200 million.

Corporate sales teams are expanding their tools from just file-sharing services that house sales and marketing content to software from Highspot or rivals like Seismic Software Inc. that help find the right information faster.

Story continues

Cloud-based communications company RingCentral Inc. started using Highspot last year and now has 2,500 sales reps accessing 10,000 pieces of content weekly. The company counts more than 400 deals that were positively influenced by Highspot, said Sheevaun Thatcher, global head of digital learning and enablement at RingCentral. Combined with Salesforce software, Highspot’s product lets her see what stage deals are at when certain material is shared with customers, evaluate what works and what doesn’t, and adjust as needed.

“It’s a gold mine for us,” Thatcher said.

55,2021-02-21T12:13:05+00:00,"Barron's Latest Picks And Pans: Bank Stocks, BDCs, Blackstone, Fluor, Oracle And More","This weekend's Barron's cover story explores one enterprise software company's transformation into a cloud giant. Other featured articles discuss who dominates the public cloud, who stands to benefit as Texas rebuilds and how to tell when tech companies are overvalued. Also, the prospects for a private-equity giant, an engineering company, bank stocks, business development companies and more.

Cover story ""Oracle Is Turning Into a Cloud Giant. Why Its Stock Is a Buy"" by Eric J. Savitz discusses how a new giant is starting to flex its muscles in cloud computing, and it isn't some upstart. See why Barron's claims that enterprise software company Oracle Corporation (NYSE: VZ) has been undergoing a Microsoft-like reinvention, and why that makes the stock a buy.

Avi Salzman's ""Texas Looks to Rebuild. Here Are 6 Stocks That Could Benefit"" suggests that companies that provide energy infrastructure and oil-and-gas producers that were spared storm damage in Texas offer opportunities. What does that mean for the likes of Eaton Corporation PLC (NYSE: ETN), Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) and even General Electric Company (NYSE: GE).

In ""Who Rules the Cloud? The Answer Is Hazy,"" Eric J. Savitz points out that the data showing who dominates the U.S. public cloud market are obfuscated by definitions that can make comparisons among providers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) almost impossible. Is that a problem?

Private-equity giant Blackstone Group Inc (NYSE: BX) is pushing hard into life sciences at a critical time, according to ""Blackstone Makes a Big Bet on Life Sciences"" by Liz Moyer. See what that means for Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT), Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) and a number of others.

In Daren Fonda's ""Fluor Is Engineering a Turnaround. Its Stock Could Soar,"" the focus is on how engineering and construction company Fluor Corp (NYSE: FLR) is pivoting toward growth industries and fixing its past problems. Find out why the Texas-based company could be a beneficiary of U.S. infrastructure spending and why Barron's sees the share price rising as much as 80%.

""Tech Valuations Are Getting Scary. Here's How We Know"" by Eric J. Savitz explains that companies such as Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) trade at more than 35 times sales estimates for 2021. That doesn't leave much room for error, and Wall Street doesn't seem to be concerned.

In ""Bank Stocks Are Getting Hot. They Still Have Room to Run,"" Carleton English says that bank stocks today trade roughly where they did a year ago, with the KBW Bank Index up more than 16% this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 4% gain. Find out if Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) or JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) are among those with room to run.

Alexandra Scaggs's ""BDCs Yield Around 9%, but Their Quality Varies. Here's How to Judge Them"" explains that business development companies such as Owl Rock Capital Corp (NYSE: ORCC) are reporting earnings, and income investors should consider paying attention to the status of their loan portfolios for some attractive yield.

You can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.

Insider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.

Almost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.

Warren Buffett

We have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.

Since hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the ""best stocks to buy for beginner investors"". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.

Overall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.

More than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.

In this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.

Every quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).

The best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Below we listed the 15 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of December 2020. We believe these are the 15 best stocks a beginner investor can buy today:

11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS): $183

Number of Hedge Funds: 144 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 112 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $16.42 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.2% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 1.0% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 14 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 18 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL): $129.71

Number of Hedge Funds: 146 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 134 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $141.8 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.5% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -2.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 9 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 11 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Berkshire Hathaway

9. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL): $290.81

Number of Hedge Funds: 147 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.96 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 16.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 24.2% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 8 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 9 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Philippe Laffont, Christopher Lyle, Fisher Asset Management

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA): $338.46

Number of Hedge Funds: 154 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 133 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $18 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.4% First Quarter Return (through February 18): -5.1% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 10 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 7 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Akre Capital Management, Berkshire Hathaway Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Card, Logo, Sign, Symbol, Money, Dollars, Bank, Finance, Business, pay, express

7. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA): $264.51

Number of Hedge Funds: 156 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 166 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $17.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.6% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 13.7% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 4 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 5 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Ken Fisher

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

6. Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG): $2,117.20

Number of Hedge Funds: 157 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $20.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.7% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 20.9% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 7 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 8 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Boykin Curry

Disney ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:

“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth.

Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”

PYPL ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.

The growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.

The company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.

CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”

Revenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.

BABA ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors. Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

6. Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG): $2,117.20

Number of Hedge Funds: 157 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 150 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $20.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 17.7% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 20.9% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 7 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 8 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Boykin Curry

58,2021-02-19T18:57:39+00:00,3 Alt Energy Stocks to Buy Today,"Many have been running out of gas. And some saw the proverbial plug came undone Thursday. I’m referring to alt energy stocks. It raises the question, is now a good opportunity for buyers? Let’s look at three names making the case for stocks to buy within this broad and emerging market, coupled with hedged strategies designed to put some green into your portfolio more safely.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). CIIG Merger Corp (NASDAQ:CIIC). Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK). SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR). Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). From exciting EV’s to green-powered commercial vehicles, new battery technology, charging stations, solar, hydrogen fuel cells and more, the alternative energy universe is both diverse and here to stay. What will it actually look like five, 10 or 25 years from now? That’s anybody’s guess.

But in 2020 this eclectic space took off like wildfire on Wall Street. There were new stocks to buy everywhere. A wave of blank-check deals to deal with investors’ animal spirits certainly helped with that.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But the huge increase in alt energy-related stocks is also supported by technological innovation, increasing cost competitiveness and knowledge that we’re past the point of arguing about climate change. Well, kinda sorta.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

To be sure, nothing is easy. And this critical movement is at odds with fossil fuel producers like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). This week’s wrongful finger pointing at renewables amid Texas’ energy grid problem is a testament to that friction. My advice for investors? Don’t sweat the political theater. Instead, use opportunities like today’s saber rattling to your advantage with the following three alt energy names now better positioned as stocks to buy:

QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE)

Alt Energy Stocks to Buy: QuantumScape (QS) QuantumScape (QS) turning the corner in deep corrective base

The first of our alt energy stocks to buy are shares of QuantumScape. QS is a Silicon Valley-based startup which maintains backers such as auto giant Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bill Gates. Enough, said? Not quite.

QuantumScape’s solid-state quantum lithium-metal battery technology has many seeing a so-called Jesus battery. It remains to be seen if QS is the real deal. But this past December the company did provide a successful glimpse of its end game. If QS delivers, incredibly improved storage capacity, charging performance, reliability and safety, as well as cost efficiency could topple the EV market’s combustion engine competition.

Technically, QS has turned the corner into the right side of a very deep corrective base after successfully testing the 76% retracement level tied to its October low. The observation is QuantumScape has a real shot at regaining favor with investors. Don’t expect a straight line higher in this ultra-volatile stock to buy. But don’t panic when conditions look less rosy. Rather, use those bouts of adverse price behavior to your advantage with a fully-hedged and flexible stock collar.

Workhorse Group is the next of our alt energy stocks to buy. The EV commercial van upstart is one of three finalists waiting on a U.S. Postal Service contract order worth an estimated $6 billion. Unlike the competition and as InvestorPlace’sLouis Navellier notes, WKHS is the only candidate looking to fill the government order of 180,000 delivery vans with electric vehicles. It’s a huge edge given the Biden administration’s aggressive push into renewables.

Bears of this heavily-shorted outfit see a different and much uglier outcome for this stock to buy. And truthfully, the importance of the postal deal for Workhorse can’t be dismissed. If successful, brand name awareness, other deals and profitability will surely follow. If not? Sticking around in this alt energy stock looks like a bad idea.

Technically, this stock to buy has retreated about 28% from its early February all-time-high after soaring out of a larger triangular base. The corrective pullback has put shares into a testing position of Fibonacci support, as well as its former pattern high from September. Without calling a bottom, the observation is this stock to buy is close enough to being in position for buying leveraged and well-positioned upside, while avoiding more significant and always possible downside risk.

Nextera Energy is the last of our alt energy stocks to buy. Of the three, it’s the least contested, well outside of the political theater going on in Texas. NEE is a Florida-based utility company at the forefront of renewables-driven electricity generation using solar and wind. It’s the world’s largest. And bottom-line, it’s a business model that’s working and even pays investors an annual dividend approaching 2%.

Technically, this stock to buy has pulled back within a sustainable-looking uptrend after hitting all-time-highs out of a cup-shaped breakout. The past few weeks have been spent consolidating around the pattern’s high. Today and with stochastics in a neutral position, but not yet signaling a low is in place, a tighter collar and getting a head start on NEE’s next quarterly payment of 38.50 cents looks about right.

59,2021-02-19T17:14:01+00:00,7 Growth Stocks to Plant in Your Portfolio,"Many investors enjoy a good dividend and low valuation. But here’s the truth: without growth stocks, investors are missing out on some excellent opportunities.

Admittedly, growth stocks can come with high valuations and increased volatility. However, they aren’t all like that. Many have the best margins in the market and balance sheets that appear impenetrable.

These are some of the most valuable companies on earth for a reason — and not because we’re in a bubble. Instead, it’s because they have superior brands (moats), robust growth and fat profit margins.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

If these stocks aren’t for certain investors, that’s fine. But understand that they help drive the overall indices higher, too. Although growth names can have higher volatility from time to time, long-term holders can see massive returns. Sometimes, those returns are life-changing.

7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of

So, let’s look at a few top growth stocks that investors should keep their eye on:

Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Invitae (NYSE:NVTA)

Growth Stocks to Buy: Pinterest (PINS) the pinterest (PINS) logo on a mobile phone held by a woman

Pinterest is one of the best growth stocks I’m aware of right now. It has robust revenue momentum, it’s profitable and it has a great balance sheet. Best of all? Wall Street still seems skeptical.

In mid-February, the company turned in an impressive fourth-quarter earnings report as top- and bottom-line results blew past estimates. Guidance for the next quarter came in well ahead of expectations, too.

Simply put, analysts have been far too conservative and it shows. Wall Street has practically blown off the company’s lights-out quarter, although they were willing to gobble up the stock on reports that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was interested in acquiring the name a few months ago.

Story continues

Even though those talks are reportedly not ongoing, perhaps that gives investors faith that there could be a bid in the stock price in the event of a deeper correction.

Obviously, anything can happen in the market — such as a quick 25% pullback, for instance — but PINS stock seems like it has significant upside in the future. Particularly with the valuations that Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) are garnering despite their inferior businesses.

Salesforce (CRM) A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce (CRM) sticker.

One reason I really like Salesforce as one of the growth stocks to buy on this list? Simply that it hasn’t been participating in the rally.

Sure, we all love seeing relative strength in our holdings and we enjoy stocks making record highs. But let’s face it: it can be hard to pull the trigger on some names as they continue to crank out new high after new high.

Thankfully, though, there are some high-quality holdings that aren’t doing that on a daily basis. Salesforce is one of them.

CRM stock just hit a multi-month high, yet it remains about 15% below its all-time highs. The stock commands a market capitalization of “just” $227 billion. While large, it’s possible that Salesforce will become one of tech’s future titans — like FAANG.

7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Aren’t a Gamble

With strong revenue-growth forecasts for the next few years, I expect CRM to continue churning out free cash flow and making savvy acquisitions like Slack (NYSE:WORK). Further, investments like those made in Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) should continue to pay dividends.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) a Google Pixel smartphone

Speaking of FAANG, let’s look at that group’s best performing component in 2021 and over the last six months.

When it comes to growth stocks, Alphabet has been in a league of its own. While mega-cap tech stocks continue to consolidate, shares in GOOG stock continue to rocket higher.

The company commands a $1.4 trillion market cap and the stock is up 36% over the last six months. However, that doesn’t mean it’s done going higher. Of course, Alphabet stock will eventually need to rest, but right now it’s firing on all cylinders.

For instance, the company’s recent Q4 earnings report was robust. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $22.30 came in about 40% ahead of consensus expectations, while revenue of $56.9 billion grew 23.5% year-over-year (YOY) and beat estimates by about $4 billion.

On top of that, analysts expect solid growth over the next several years as well.

Alphabet stock will go through its consolidation phase eventually, but this one is ultimately a long-term winner. It owns the two most popular websites in the world — Google and YouTube — and it has solid, steady growth.

Lastly, its balance sheet is robust. The company’s total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities sit at more than $136 billion while its long-term debt rests at just $13.9 billion.

Farfetch (FTCH) farfetch (FTCH) logo next to a hanger

While Farfetch has done a great job of holding its recent gains, this pick seems undervalued by Wall Street. Couple that with its strong growth and FTCH stock is a perfect candidate when it comes to growth stocks to build around.

Farfetch is the premiere marketplace for luxury goods. And despite the economic impact of the novel coronavirus, it still has strong growth. More specifically, the company has trailing 12-month revenue growth of more than 80%. Going forward, analysts expect 36.6% growth in 2021 and 28.7% growth in 2022.

Despite this robust growth though, FTCH stock’s valuation remains relatively low. Shares trade at just 14.3 times forward price-sales. For a tech stock and online marketplace churning out these kinds of growth numbers, I’m surprised it’s not being valued more highly.

7 Stocks That Elon Musk Loves — And That You Should Too

Plus, throw in China via Farfetch’s partnership with Alibaba and we have a recipe for even larger growth.

Speaking of Alibaba, I would be remiss if I left out China’s crown jewel of e-commerce from this list of growth stocks. In fact, scratch that — Alibaba is a crown jewel outside of China, too.

The company has taken a strategy similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). After building out a successful e-commerce arm, BABA began to expand. It continues to rack up assets (either via investments or created on its own) and it’s become a juggernaut in one of the world’s largest, fastest-growing economies.

China’s economy is second only to the United States, but with the way it’s growing and with its population — which is over four times the size of the U.S. — it’s only a matter of time before it becomes the largest.

Alibaba serves that population through its Amazon-like website. But the company also owns the other two most popular e-commerce sites in China: Taobao and Tmall.

Additionally, BABA has its own cloud business, as well as logistics and digital entertainment units. Plus, thile its investment in Ant Group didn’t go quite as planned thanks to a nixed initial public offering (IPO), it’s not something to write off either.

Ant was primed to make a record IPO before regulators stirred up some drama. But that negative short-term catalyst has a bright side: it created a nice buying opportunity in BABA stock.

Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo displayed on phone screen

I have been a big-time bull on Nvidia for one simple reason: this pick of the growth stocks is a building block for numerous growth themes of the future.

Nvidia doesn’t just make one or two commoditized components for industries seeing cyclical growth. It’s making crucial components for multiple industries that have long-term secular growth.

The company’s graphics processing unites (GPUs) are significantly better than its competitors’ units. Further, Nvidia caters to data centers and the cloud, autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs), gaming, graphics and high-powered computers.

None of these industries are going to disappear in the near future — they will simply continue to grow.

When NVDA stock corrected in Q1 2020, it only dipped to its 200-day moving average before erupting to new highs. While it’s been consolidating for months now, shares just hit new all-time highs, reaching $614.90 on Feb. 16. And you can look for the company to continue chugging higher, especially if it lands its prized acquisition of Arm. All in all, Nvidia’s numbers won’t quit. Covid-19 accelerated demand in 2020 and NVDA continues to sport impressive growth estimates moving forward.

Plus, the fact that it’s very profitable and free cash flow positive will cement it as a pillar of the tech sector for years — and likely decades — to come.

Invitae (NVTA) a visualization of DNA in a vial

Last on my list of growth stocks is Invitae, easily the most speculative name on here. I have written about Invitae sparingly over the last two years.

NVTA has such a promising business model in a budding industry, but its execution hasn’t been as reliable. That’s made it a hard investment to stomach. It’s volatility can be rampant at times.

The company’s biggest issue isn’t growth — in fact, there is so much opportunity for growth here that it’s insane. The genomics space is ripe with potential, as technology is finally allowing us to leverage the strength of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve our health.

That’s exactly what Invitae is doing, using its technology to churn out results that otherwise wouldn’t be possible. The company’s work is incredible and it’s one reason why analysts expect almost 42% revenue growth next year.

If it delivers in-line results, Invitae could generate some $700 million in sales in 2022. So, like I said, growth isn’t the problem.

What is? Cash burn.

Put simply, the company does not generate a profit and it does not operate with positive cash flow. That’s not a deal-breaker necessarily, but at some point investors need to stop being diluted and the company needs to stop raising cash.

If Invitae can tighten up its cash burn and work its bottom line in the right direction, NVTA stock has the potential to be a huge winner in an emerging industry.

Why Is Bitcoin Soaring to New Highs?

Perhaps the biggest reason behind the recent Bitcoin rally is that major companies and investors are finally throwing their weight behind the cryptocurrency.

Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones recently said that Bitcoin is just getting started and currently in its “first inning.” Jones also said that Bitcoin is the best inflation hedge. Twitter’s founder and CEO Jack Dorsey along with rapper Jay Z launched a Bitcoin development fund by investing 500 Bitcoins. Dorsey said that it will be a ""blind irrevocable trust"" focused on Africa and India. Square also recently bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin.

63,2021-02-18T16:08:05+00:00,Bill Gates: with vaccine acceptance U.S. will be back to normal by fall,"Bill Gates, author of ‘How to Avoid a Climate Disaster’, joins Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine progress around the world.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Last time we talked, we were talking only about COVID at that point. And you said we would be completely back to normal until this coming fall. Does that still feel right to you? And if so, when do you think we'll be completely back, maybe more specifically?

BILL GATES: Well, the good news, since we last talked, is the progress in the vaccines. And although, in a few cases, the manufacturing volumes have been hard to ramp up, overall, most of the vaccine constructs work well. The only negative news since then is the rise of the variants. And The Gates Foundation funded all these trials in South Africa.

We did that not because we knew in advance some variant would show up during those trials, but we wanted safety data in Africa to convince Africans that they should consider taking the vaccine. And we wanted a population of people living with HIV to see how the vaccine worked there. Now, it turned out that as we ran that trial, we could see the variant coming in, and we saw that two of the three vaccines we were testing-- Novavax and Johnson & Johnson-- retained a lot of strength.

And so now, the discussion about, do you need a third dose? OK, if so, is it a different vaccine than the your first two? Do we need to tune the vaccine? Our vaccine team is working with the government now to figure out that plan.

So that is-- you know, it's going to extend things a bit and, you know, cause us to be careful in our behavior. But overall, I'd still say, by the fall, the US, particularly if we can get the message out to encourage wide acceptance of the vaccine, will avoid a fall wave, which will be, you know, fantastic. Now, we need to help the whole world, and that's where the Gates Foundation funding of these Indian factories and getting huge capacity up so the disease isn't coming back to the US, so we have a world economy that's going full speed that creates jobs here and just to save lives.

ANDY SERWER: Bill, forgive me if you did this on national television last week, but have you gotten vaccinated?

BILL GATES: I did. I'm very lucky. It's the first time I've been pleased to be such an old man at 65. So I just made the cutoff.

ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone. I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to a Yahoo Finance special, ""Climate Crisis."" I'm joined now by Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, former CEO of Microsoft, and author of the new book ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."" Bill, welcome.

BILL GATES: Great to be with you.

ANDY SERWER: So I want to start off by asking you about the weather. And right now, the US is experiencing a massive, highly unusual deep freeze. Is this due to climate change, do you think?

BILL GATES: Well, these events become more likely because of climate change because the normal wind patterns are broken down. And so a cold front can go further south more often than we would expect. So yeah, the extreme events are coming more often and with more force, including hurricanes, than before we started warming the Earth.

ANDY SERWER: This recent storm has caused massive power outages in Texas. And the state's governor, Greg Abbott, blamed frozen wind turbines and said it shows the Green New Deal would, quote, ""be a deadly deal for the United States."" How would you respond to that, Bill?

BILL GATES: Well, in terms of the current situation, he's actually wrong. The wind turbines-- you can make sure they can deal with the cold. It probably wasn't anticipated for the wind turbines that far south, but the ones up in Iowa and North Dakota do have the ability to not freeze up. Actually, the main capacity that's gone out in Texas is not the wind. It's actually some of the natural gas plants that were also not ready for these super-cold temperatures. So even though viewing this as an attack on renewable energy in this case is wrong, in fact, the point he's making, which is that as you rely more and more on wind and solar, that reliability will be a challenge.

Story continues

And you'll need three things to maintain reliability while driving renewables over 80%. One is more transmission. So we have an open source model. We're going to show that if Texas had had slightly more in a connection, they wouldn't have had a problem. The second is energy storage. It's still hard to store these amounts of energy. And finally, sources of energy that aren't weather-dependent but are green like nuclear. And so those three will be an important part of the zero emission electricity system.

ANDY SERWER: Bill, how do we explain climate change so people understand that the threat is real?

BILL GATES: Yeah. Sadly, the effects accumulate over time. And they're worse in natural ecosystems like coral reefs that are dying off or at the poles where the ice melting is accelerating a great deal. And so giving people a direct experience of the wildfires or that sea level rise and then helping them extrapolate that heat waves are going to kill a lot of people-- you won't be able to do outdoor work, including farming and construction, and that nature just can't adjust as fast as we're causing this warming-- that's a communications challenge.

I will say that during the pandemic, it's a huge crisis. And normally, people-- their interest in things that are longer term goes away. But in fact, the interest in climate particularly amongst the young generation, has stayed very strong, enough so that all these build back better plans in the US, the UK, the European Union, all of them are climate-themed so that a lot of it will go to these breakthrough projects to get emissions dramatically reduced.

ANDY SERWER: I want to get back to that point you're making about the links between the COVID pandemic and climate change in a minute. But in your book, you talked about 51 billion tons of greenhouse gas being released in the atmosphere every year, and we need to get to 0. Is there a tipping point from where we can't recover?

BILL GATES: We don't know of a specific tipping point. So 2050 is the earliest that you can imagine the manufacturing, electric grid, transport, farming, building, heating, all five sectors making these big changes. The more CO2 you put in-- because it stays for thousands of years-- that all sums up, and you get a temperature increase, which sadly causes the hurricane severity and the overall inability to grow crops like we used to.

There may be tipping points, like when the permafrost melts so much and releases even more greenhouse gas. So that's a positive feedback loop. In the Arctic, the fact that the ice, when it goes away-- that when the sun hits the water, it's darker, and so it captures more heat-- that's a positive feedback effect. But that one's already in the models.

And so if we could do it by 2040, that would be better. But the warming overall, we know, even without those surprises, will be very bad. So we'll have to help with adaptation while we do the reductions, which is called mitigation.

ANDY SERWER: Let's get to that point again about the links between COVID and climate change. What are some of those links? For instance, people talk about zoonotic diseases being a possibility, which are diseases that jump species. Is that the case, perhaps?

BILL GATES: Yeah. Most all diseases, infectious diseases, are things that were in other species but were somehow stable there because they were benign. So HIV crosses over from chimps through some bushmeat event that may have been as early as 1900. Measles is zoonotic. And coronavirus, we're a little unsure. Did it go through an intermediate species coming from the bats? But it starts out in bats.

So yes, as we're encroaching on nature in places like Africa more and more, that ability of things to cross over is very significant. And climate means that, sadly, we'll be destroying more natural habitat, and the overlap between humans and the animals will be that much greater. So this time, we should take our lesson. Knowing that the chance of a natural pandemic is 2% or 3% a year, we should make the billions of investment to avoid the trillions and trillions of damage that we've seen.

ANDY SERWER: So you talk about those lessons at the end of the book learned from COVID that could be applied to climate change. And that would be one of them, I guess.

BILL GATES: Yeah. Counting on government to think ahead-- that's their role. They tell us to do building codes because of earthquakes. They have the Defense Department do war games to appreciate how they can be ready. The two things governments didn't invest enough in are, number one, pandemics, and number two is getting us ready for climate change.

ANDY SERWER: Asking a question from a Yahoo Finance perspective, Bill, have the financial markets priced in climate change, say, in terms of real estate or the value of oil stocks, just to name two?

BILL GATES: You know, I'm not an expert on those valuations. The oil stocks have come down partly because the demand during the pandemic has been super low. Greenhouse gases went down about 8%, which, in a way, it's kind of stunning given the change in travel and activity that it's so low. It kind of reminds us that we're still making cement and steel, and there's so many different areas of emission that travel alone didn't give us a dramatic cut there.

There's probably some Teslas out there, but identifying who they are in advance-- you know, people are going to take the industrial problems or transmission problems or food problems. The market's looking positively at people like Beyond Meat, QuantumScape. Those are investments I made for climate reasons that at least so far have been profitable investments. So it's nice to see the willingness to reward those companies and appreciate they'll have a strong future.

Some of the oil companies are transferring their skills over to things like CO2 removable or biofuels. Some are saying saying, no, we're going to just stay specialized and see how it goes. And I think the market is drawing a distinction between those two strategies.

ANDY SERWER: One thing you talked about, one concept in your book, Bill, is green premiums and the notion that green things cost more. How are we going to get over that problem, really, in society?

BILL GATES: Yeah. Given that your audience thinks about finance, I think this is a very important metric that will help them appreciate any climate-related advance to see how impactful it is. We emit 51 billion tons a year right now in CO2 equivalents. And if we invent a way to withdraw a ton from the air for $100 a ton, which there's a good chance we'll have that in the next decade, the brute force approach would be to say, fine, just pay that industry $100 times $51 billion, and so $5 trillion a year.

And you have to say is, the world willing to come up with that type of money? And the answer is not a chance. In fact, the way I look at it is in 2050 when we're talking to India, that will still be building buildings and providing light and air conditioning at a very basic level for their people-- when we say to them, please use the green stuff-- the green cement, the green steel, the green electricity, the green transport-- they're going to say to us, look, you did most of these emissions.

You're richer than us. You're extravagant compared to what we're trying to provide. And so unless you subsidize most of this green premium, which over decades would be trillions of dollars, we're just going to do it the normal way and expect you to solve it.

Now, if you get the green premium down 95% from $5 trillion a year to $250 billion a year, then the world's rich governments, I think, both in terms of their own subsidies and helping other countries, that is definitely within reason. And so we would be willing to help India out, and they would make that decision. Because their emissions are rising.

So our responsibility as a country is not just to zero out our 15% of emissions. If we do that in a brute-force, expensive way, nobody else can follow along, or very few, whereas if we do it in an innovative way where we're, every year, saying, OK, who can help bring this green premium down, how do we bootstrap the demand for that product, how do we accelerate innovation, then we're really talking about the real problem. And the US has the majority of the world's innovation power. And if we do innovate, then we get world-class companies like Tesla that are helping to solve the problem globally.

ANDY SERWER: Even assuming that we can get the US economy onboard with these ideas, Bill, how sanguine are you about getting the Chinese to be a part of this kind of endeavor?

BILL GATES: Well, it's super important because they're also a source of innovation. Their universities are not as good as ours, but they've gotten a lot better. They are huge in the industrial economy. Almost half the world's cement, half the world's steel is made in that one country, some of it embedded in exports that they make. And they also finance coal plants not just domestically, but as part of the Belt and Road Initiative in other countries as well.

Their current commitment is 0 by 2060. And so how can we, in a win-win kind of way, get them to bring that date earlier and not have them promoting coal in such a big way? The remaining coal-- although there's a few plants in rich countries, and we need to get rid of those, it's really about China and India. And it's tricky because we have a complex relationship with China. John Kerry is going to do his best to see if this isn't an area that we're helping each other.

ANDY SERWER: And speaking of John Kerry, what sort of communication, Bill, have you had with the Biden administration when it comes to climate change?

BILL GATES: Yeah. I had a chance to talk to the President-elect several times. And the two topics we talked about were pandemic, ending this one and avoiding the next one, and then also climate change. So right up there in his top priorities is climate. And it's such a hard problem. That's what it's going to take.

The team of people he's picking, from Gina McCarthy, John Kerry-- even in the non-climate-type jobs like National Economic Council, Brian Deese, he's got a lot of great experience. And so our dialogue with both the president, but now in terms of more specifics, the team that's creating his plan-- and he's really given them a lot of delegated authority because he picked the right people. That's really coming into focus. They're going to have events, probably in April. And then for the world in November in Glasgow is this COP26 meeting that will be very, very important.

ANDY SERWER: Last time we talked-- we were talking only about COVID at that point, and you said we wouldn't be completely back to normal until this coming fall. Does that still feel right to you? And if so, when do you think we'll be completely back, maybe, more specifically?

BILL GATES: Well, the good news since we last talked is the progress in the vaccines. And although in a few cases, the manufacturing volumes have been hard to ramp up, overall, most the vaccine constructs worked well. The only negative news since then is the rise of the variants. And the Gates Foundation funded all these trials in South Africa. We did that not because we knew in advance some variant would show up during those trials, but we wanted safety data in Africa to convince Africans that they should consider taking the vaccine. And we wanted a population of people living with HIV to see how the vaccine worked there.

Now, it turned out that as we ran that trial, we could see the variant coming in. And we saw that two of the three vaccines we were testing, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, retained a lot of strength. And so now the discussion about do you need a third dose-- if so, is it a different vaccine than the first two? Do we need to tune the vaccine? Our vaccine team is working with the government now to figure out that plan.

So that is going to extend things a bit and cause us to be careful in our behavior. But overall, I'd still say by the fall, the US, particularly if we can get the message out to encourage wide acceptance of the vaccine, will avoid a fall wave, which will be fantastic.

Now, we need to help the whole world. And that's where the Gates Foundation funding of these Indian factories and getting huge capacity up so the disease isn't coming back to the US, so we have a world economy that's going full speed that creates jobs here, and just to save lives.

ANDY SERWER: Bill, forgive me if you did this on national television last week, but have you gotten vaccinated?

BILL GATES: I did. I'm very lucky. It's the first time I've been pleased to be such an old man at 65. So I just made the cutoff. So last Friday, I had my second dose of Moderna. And I was lucky to have very modest side effects.

ANDY SERWER: That's good to hear. What about the vaccine to doses and the distribution when it comes to the developing world and the non-developing world?

BILL GATES: Yeah. So we've had five vaccines that have received gold-standard approval. Pfizer and Moderna are the first two, which are both mRNA, and then AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and now Novavax is coming along. All five of those vaccines are amazing vaccines. And sadly, those first two are fairly expensive to make and hard to scale up the volume.

So although for the rich world, they'll be the primary vaccines, for the developing world, it'll be numbers three through five. And targeting those based on which variant is where and ramping up that capacity, that is our obsessive focus now. Because if that all goes well, it's only about a six-month delta between the rich world reaching a certain vaccination level and, say-- India or South Africa or South America have had a terrible epidemic. If that doesn't go well, it could be as much as 18 months. And so the whole world be reinfected.

Right now, I'm optimistic that the pieces are coming into place even though we're going to have to be a little more targeted about where the AstraZeneca gets used and how we might actually-- this will surprise people-- combine it so you're taking one dose of one vaccine and a second dose of another one. We have trials out to see if that would avoid any of these limitations.

ANDY SERWER: Do we have the wherewithal and the supply chain and the ability to even execute something like that, though?

BILL GATES: Yeah. Our foundation worked with the big Indian manufacturers, who we do a lot with because they always do cost-reduced vaccines. Once a Western company invents a vaccine, they have no real incentive to bring the cost of manufacture down. Say it's $30, but they're selling the vaccine for $100.

Then we often go to India, and it can take 5 to 10 years, and we get a $2 version of that vaccine. In this case, we can't wait to have it re-engineered at low cost. And fortunately, vaccines 3 through 5 can be made for less than $3 a dose. So we've reserved big capacity. And these are much bigger factories than the West has. Serum by volume sells five times as many vaccines as anyone. They just happen to be mostly $2 vaccines. And there's two competitors to Serum which we are a key partner of.

So we've been getting those factories going. Serum is making AstraZeneca today. Serum will be making Novavax as that gets approved. And another one of the companies, [INAUDIBLE], will make Johnson & Johnson. And so those factories will be the primary supply to the developing countries because the numbers are just so big, and the rich countries aren't going to cede their capacity.

Now, the US by summer may have spare doses to send to the developing world as we meet US demand, depending on do we go for a third dose or exactly how that works. Sometime in the summer, the US can start those donations that'll help the developing world catch up.

ANDY SERWER: Bill, I want to go back to climate change for a minute because I wanted to ask you about your projections. And you remain hopeful that we can tackle climate change before it's too late. But do you worry that being too optimistic can undercut the urgency and the difficulty of the task, and how do you balance that?

BILL GATES: Yeah, I tried to strike the right balance in the book. There are people who think it's going to be easy, and that's really a problem. There are people who don't think it's important. That's a problem. There's people who think it's impossible. That's a problem.

And so how do you get all those people and say, very important, very hard, very doable? And I bring my optimism from other endeavors, from the magic of software at Microsoft and the magic of new vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives through my foundation work. But I can't guarantee we'll solve it. It's a tougher space.

It's a larger-scale thing than anything I've ever engaged in, or really humanity has this as a challenge. So I'm not trying to be too negative, which can turn people off, and yet the damage of climate change cannot really be overstated. It'll be a death rate five times the pandemic per year and going up every year, and there won't be a single thing like a vaccine that can magically get rid of it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. That's a chilling metaphor, but maybe that is part of the urgency balance that you're talking about, right?

BILL GATES: Exactly.

ANDY SERWER: While I have you here, I have to ask you a tech question. In a recent interview in ""The New York Times,"" you said you would advise Mark Zuckerberg to implement an advisory board. Were you referring to the oversight board that just came out with its first ruling and will decide in a couple of months about whether President Trump should be allowed back on? And do you think he should be allowed back on?

BILL GATES: Mark is, I think, a great person really trying to maintain the great things about digital social networking and curb the hard ones. Most people don't have a really good solution of how you separate out the good and the bad and the role of government in the company. The oversight board, which he might have been planning to do without, was something that I suggested to him to get it out of, OK, what does Mark think. Rather, these are some eminent thinkers. And in each country, they may reflect the cultural values of that country. And so you're bringing them in with a sense of responsibility there.

I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes-- well less than a majority, but I don't think having him off forever would be that good. If he's spreading lies about the integrity of the election, does that need to be labeled? Is he actually less important in terms of causing trouble in the future than he was in the past? But it'd be kind of a shame if they have to use such an extreme measure when there are people who want to see debates around his views. And splitting the digital world into, OK, here's this site that's for one party or part of one party, and here's another site for another one-- that kind of polarization is probably not a good thing.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Bill, you're one of the world's wealthiest people, and you speak on these hot-button issues at a time when people do distrust what wealthy people say on just about everything. Do you worry that public advocacy actually could, could backfire in your case?

BILL GATES: Yeah, I have to be careful. I mean, I do have an extremely high carbon footprint, although I'm paying $7 million a year to use green aviation fuel and do direct air capture and fund low-cost housing to not use natural gas and use electric heat pumps. So there's a lot of ways that I more than offset my emissions. Of course, everything I say, people should study on their own.

If they have other ways to solve the climate problem, God bless them. I hope I missed some ways to solve it in my book. And that's the beauty of having young people care so much about it. And I've got programs like a thing called Fellows to draw in the smartest young kids, whether they're currently in academia or in a big company, to encourage them to take a few years and figure out is their idea fundable so that we can get more breakthrough companies that are funded and, with a certain success rate, give us a variety of solutions.

And so I wish some of the topics I talked about, there were more voices. When it comes to malaria, let's have more people saying, let's do this. Even warning about the risk of a pandemic, that talk-- 98% of the viewership is after the pandemic started. Well, it was supposed to be the other way around. We were supposed to watch it before the pandemic and then have every country be more like Australia, where less than 10% of the damage and deaths and educational deficits have been suffered there. So I do want people to talk about climate, but I don't mind if they come up with better approaches.

ANDY SERWER: You work so hard when it comes to COVID and climate change, and people still beat you up for your trouble sometimes. Have you ever thought, why not just buy a news organization like a Jeff Bezos or Marc Benioff or start one yourself? Have you thought about that?

BILL GATES: No. I'm not going to do that. I think Jeff Bezos buying ""The Washington Post"" has allowed them to continue to be aggressive and be an important voice in the media space. But I don't think his goal there was to affect their message in some particular way. I think that would destroy the asset despite the wild claims that get made. So I'm glad somebody is providing long-term capital for great interactive news, but I don't see myself.

I've gone pretty full up. Just finishing this pandemic and preparing for the next one and all those global health challenges, that's a full-time job. I still spend a bit of time talking to Microsoft about that product roadmap. And now with climate, this is just such a special year with all this new money that can make a difference with the big conference.

I decided waiting to put the book out would miss an opportunity to set the framework for how we discuss it-- really understanding all the sources, thinking about the green premium, appreciating the miracle of the industrial economy and the scale of it and the low cost of it. That's what we've got to go and change. And so I decided, OK, this year, I'll have to do both the pandemic, global health, and climate discussion so I don't miss this special time.

ANDY SERWER: You certainly have a lot on your plate, Bill, and we really appreciate the time you've given us today. Bill Gates, thanks very much.

ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone. I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to a Yahoo Finance special, ""Climate Crisis."" I'm joined now by Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, former CEO of Microsoft, and author of the new book ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."" Bill, welcome.

BILL GATES: Yeah. Counting on government to think ahead-- that's their role. They tell us to do building codes because of earthquakes. They have the Defense Department do war games to appreciate how they can be ready. The two things governments didn't invest enough in are, number one, pandemics, and number two is getting us ready for climate change.

ANDY SERWER: Asking a question from a Yahoo Finance perspective, Bill, have the financial markets priced in climate change, say, in terms of real estate or the value of oil stocks, just to name two?

BILL GATES: You know, I'm not an expert on those valuations. The oil stocks have come down partly because the demand during the pandemic has been super low. Greenhouse gases went down about 8%, which, in a way, it's kind of stunning given the change in travel and activity that it's so low. It kind of reminds us that we're still making cement and steel, and there's so many different areas of emission that travel alone didn't give us a dramatic cut there.

There's probably some Teslas out there, but identifying who they are in advance-- you know, people are going to take the industrial problems or transmission problems or food problems. The market's looking positively at people like Beyond Meat, QuantumScape. Those are investments I made for climate reasons that at least so far have been profitable investments. So it's nice to see the willingness to reward those companies and appreciate they'll have a strong future.

Some of the oil companies are transferring their skills over to things like CO2 removable or biofuels. Some are saying saying, no, we're going to just stay specialized and see how it goes. And I think the market is drawing a distinction between those two strategies.

ANDY SERWER: One thing you talked about, one concept in your book, Bill, is green premiums and the notion that green things cost more. How are we going to get over that problem, really, in society?

BILL GATES: Yeah. Given that your audience thinks about finance, I think this is a very important metric that will help them appreciate any climate-related advance to see how impactful it is. We emit 51 billion tons a year right now in CO2 equivalents. And if we invent a way to withdraw a ton from the air for $100 a ton, which there's a good chance we'll have that in the next decade, the brute force approach would be to say, fine, just pay that industry $100 times $51 billion, and so $5 trillion a year.

And you have to say is, the world willing to come up with that type of money? And the answer is not a chance. In fact, the way I look at it is in 2050 when we're talking to India, that will still be building buildings and providing light and air conditioning at a very basic level for their people-- when we say to them, please use the green stuff-- the green cement, the green steel, the green electricity, the green transport-- they're going to say to us, look, you did most of these emissions.

You're richer than us. You're extravagant compared to what we're trying to provide. And so unless you subsidize most of this green premium, which over decades would be trillions of dollars, we're just going to do it the normal way and expect you to solve it.

Now, if you get the green premium down 95% from $5 trillion a year to $250 billion a year, then the world's rich governments, I think, both in terms of their own subsidies and helping other countries, that is definitely within reason. And so we would be willing to help India out, and they would make that decision. Because their emissions are rising.

So our responsibility as a country is not just to zero out our 15% of emissions. If we do that in a brute-force, expensive way, nobody else can follow along, or very few, whereas if we do it in an innovative way where we're, every year, saying, OK, who can help bring this green premium down, how do we bootstrap the demand for that product, how do we accelerate innovation, then we're really talking about the real problem. And the US has the majority of the world's innovation power. And if we do innovate, then we get world-class companies like Tesla that are helping to solve the problem globally.

ANDY SERWER: Even assuming that we can get the US economy onboard with these ideas, Bill, how sanguine are you about getting the Chinese to be a part of this kind of endeavor?

BILL GATES: Well, it's super important because they're also a source of innovation. Their universities are not as good as ours, but they've gotten a lot better. They are huge in the industrial economy. Almost half the world's cement, half the world's steel is made in that one country, some of it embedded in exports that they make. And they also finance coal plants not just domestically, but as part of the Belt and Road Initiative in other countries as well.

Their current commitment is 0 by 2060. And so how can we, in a win-win kind of way, get them to bring that date earlier and not have them promoting coal in such a big way? The remaining coal-- although there's a few plants in rich countries, and we need to get rid of those, it's really about China and India. And it's tricky because we have a complex relationship with China. John Kerry is going to do his best to see if this isn't an area that we're helping each other.

ANDY SERWER: And speaking of John Kerry, what sort of communication, Bill, have you had with the Biden administration when it comes to climate change?

BILL GATES: Yeah. I had a chance to talk to the President-elect several times. And the two topics we talked about were pandemic, ending this one and avoiding the next one, and then also climate change. So right up there in his top priorities is climate. And it's such a hard problem. That's what it's going to take.

The team of people he's picking, from Gina McCarthy, John Kerry-- even in the non-climate-type jobs like National Economic Council, Brian Deese, he's got a lot of great experience. And so our dialogue with both the president, but now in terms of more specifics, the team that's creating his plan-- and he's really given them a lot of delegated authority because he picked the right people. That's really coming into focus. They're going to have events, probably in April. And then for the world in November in Glasgow is this COP26 meeting that will be very, very important.

ANDY SERWER: Last time we talked-- we were talking only about COVID at that point, and you said we wouldn't be completely back to normal until this coming fall. Does that still feel right to you? And if so, when do you think we'll be completely back, maybe, more specifically?

BILL GATES: Well, the good news since we last talked is the progress in the vaccines. And although in a few cases, the manufacturing volumes have been hard to ramp up, overall, most the vaccine constructs worked well. The only negative news since then is the rise of the variants. And the Gates Foundation funded all these trials in South Africa. We did that not because we knew in advance some variant would show up during those trials, but we wanted safety data in Africa to convince Africans that they should consider taking the vaccine. And we wanted a population of people living with HIV to see how the vaccine worked there.

Now, it turned out that as we ran that trial, we could see the variant coming in. And we saw that two of the three vaccines we were testing, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, retained a lot of strength. And so now the discussion about do you need a third dose-- if so, is it a different vaccine than the first two? Do we need to tune the vaccine? Our vaccine team is working with the government now to figure out that plan.

So that is going to extend things a bit and cause us to be careful in our behavior. But overall, I'd still say by the fall, the US, particularly if we can get the message out to encourage wide acceptance of the vaccine, will avoid a fall wave, which will be fantastic.

Now, we need to help the whole world. And that's where the Gates Foundation funding of these Indian factories and getting huge capacity up so the disease isn't coming back to the US, so we have a world economy that's going full speed that creates jobs here, and just to save lives.

ANDY SERWER: Bill, forgive me if you did this on national television last week, but have you gotten vaccinated?

BILL GATES: I did. I'm very lucky. It's the first time I've been pleased to be such an old man at 65. So I just made the cutoff. So last Friday, I had my second dose of Moderna. And I was lucky to have very modest side effects.

ANDY SERWER: That's good to hear. What about the vaccine to doses and the distribution when it comes to the developing world and the non-developing world?

BILL GATES: Yeah. So we've had five vaccines that have received gold-standard approval. Pfizer and Moderna are the first two, which are both mRNA, and then AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and now Novavax is coming along. All five of those vaccines are amazing vaccines. And sadly, those first two are fairly expensive to make and hard to scale up the volume.

So although for the rich world, they'll be the primary vaccines, for the developing world, it'll be numbers three through five. And targeting those based on which variant is where and ramping up that capacity, that is our obsessive focus now. Because if that all goes well, it's only about a six-month delta between the rich world reaching a certain vaccination level and, say-- India or South Africa or South America have had a terrible epidemic. If that doesn't go well, it could be as much as 18 months. And so the whole world be reinfected.

Right now, I'm optimistic that the pieces are coming into place even though we're going to have to be a little more targeted about where the AstraZeneca gets used and how we might actually-- this will surprise people-- combine it so you're taking one dose of one vaccine and a second dose of another one. We have trials out to see if that would avoid any of these limitations.

ANDY SERWER: Do we have the wherewithal and the supply chain and the ability to even execute something like that, though?

BILL GATES: Yeah. Our foundation worked with the big Indian manufacturers, who we do a lot with because they always do cost-reduced vaccines. Once a Western company invents a vaccine, they have no real incentive to bring the cost of manufacture down. Say it's $30, but they're selling the vaccine for $100.

Then we often go to India, and it can take 5 to 10 years, and we get a $2 version of that vaccine. In this case, we can't wait to have it re-engineered at low cost. And fortunately, vaccines 3 through 5 can be made for less than $3 a dose. So we've reserved big capacity. And these are much bigger factories than the West has. Serum by volume sells five times as many vaccines as anyone. They just happen to be mostly $2 vaccines. And there's two competitors to Serum which we are a key partner of.

So we've been getting those factories going. Serum is making AstraZeneca today. Serum will be making Novavax as that gets approved. And another one of the companies, [INAUDIBLE], will make Johnson & Johnson. And so those factories will be the primary supply to the developing countries because the numbers are just so big, and the rich countries aren't going to cede their capacity.

Now, the US by summer may have spare doses to send to the developing world as we meet US demand, depending on do we go for a third dose or exactly how that works. Sometime in the summer, the US can start those donations that'll help the developing world catch up.

ANDY SERWER: Bill, I want to go back to climate change for a minute because I wanted to ask you about your projections. And you remain hopeful that we can tackle climate change before it's too late. But do you worry that being too optimistic can undercut the urgency and the difficulty of the task, and how do you balance that?

BILL GATES: Yeah, I tried to strike the right balance in the book. There are people who think it's going to be easy, and that's really a problem. There are people who don't think it's important. That's a problem. There's people who think it's impossible. That's a problem.

And so how do you get all those people and say, very important, very hard, very doable? And I bring my optimism from other endeavors, from the magic of software at Microsoft and the magic of new vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives through my foundation work. But I can't guarantee we'll solve it. It's a tougher space.

It's a larger-scale thing than anything I've ever engaged in, or really humanity has this as a challenge. So I'm not trying to be too negative, which can turn people off, and yet the damage of climate change cannot really be overstated. It'll be a death rate five times the pandemic per year and going up every year, and there won't be a single thing like a vaccine that can magically get rid of it.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah. That's a chilling metaphor, but maybe that is part of the urgency balance that you're talking about, right?

BILL GATES: Exactly.

ANDY SERWER: While I have you here, I have to ask you a tech question. In a recent interview in ""The New York Times,"" you said you would advise Mark Zuckerberg to implement an advisory board. Were you referring to the oversight board that just came out with its first ruling and will decide in a couple of months about whether President Trump should be allowed back on? And do you think he should be allowed back on?

BILL GATES: Mark is, I think, a great person really trying to maintain the great things about digital social networking and curb the hard ones. Most people don't have a really good solution of how you separate out the good and the bad and the role of government in the company. The oversight board, which he might have been planning to do without, was something that I suggested to him to get it out of, OK, what does Mark think. Rather, these are some eminent thinkers. And in each country, they may reflect the cultural values of that country. And so you're bringing them in with a sense of responsibility there.

I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes-- well less than a majority, but I don't think having him off forever would be that good. If he's spreading lies about the integrity of the election, does that need to be labeled? Is he actually less important in terms of causing trouble in the future than he was in the past? But it'd be kind of a shame if they have to use such an extreme measure when there are people who want to see debates around his views. And splitting the digital world into, OK, here's this site that's for one party or part of one party, and here's another site for another one-- that kind of polarization is probably not a good thing.

ANDY SERWER: Right. Bill, you're one of the world's wealthiest people, and you speak on these hot-button issues at a time when people do distrust what wealthy people say on just about everything. Do you worry that public advocacy actually could, could backfire in your case?

BILL GATES: Yeah, I have to be careful. I mean, I do have an extremely high carbon footprint, although I'm paying $7 million a year to use green aviation fuel and do direct air capture and fund low-cost housing to not use natural gas and use electric heat pumps. So there's a lot of ways that I more than offset my emissions. Of course, everything I say, people should study on their own.

If they have other ways to solve the climate problem, God bless them. I hope I missed some ways to solve it in my book. And that's the beauty of having young people care so much about it. And I've got programs like a thing called Fellows to draw in the smartest young kids, whether they're currently in academia or in a big company, to encourage them to take a few years and figure out is their idea fundable so that we can get more breakthrough companies that are funded and, with a certain success rate, give us a variety of solutions.

And so I wish some of the topics I talked about, there were more voices. When it comes to malaria, let's have more people saying, let's do this. Even warning about the risk of a pandemic, that talk-- 98% of the viewership is after the pandemic started. Well, it was supposed to be the other way around. We were supposed to watch it before the pandemic and then have every country be more like Australia, where less than 10% of the damage and deaths and educational deficits have been suffered there. So I do want people to talk about climate, but I don't mind if they come up with better approaches.

ANDY SERWER: You work so hard when it comes to COVID and climate change, and people still beat you up for your trouble sometimes. Have you ever thought, why not just buy a news organization like a Jeff Bezos or Marc Benioff or start one yourself? Have you thought about that?

BILL GATES: No. I'm not going to do that. I think Jeff Bezos buying ""The Washington Post"" has allowed them to continue to be aggressive and be an important voice in the media space. But I don't think his goal there was to affect their message in some particular way. I think that would destroy the asset despite the wild claims that get made. So I'm glad somebody is providing long-term capital for great interactive news, but I don't see myself.

I've gone pretty full up. Just finishing this pandemic and preparing for the next one and all those global health challenges, that's a full-time job. I still spend a bit of time talking to Microsoft about that product roadmap. And now with climate, this is just such a special year with all this new money that can make a difference with the big conference.

I decided waiting to put the book out would miss an opportunity to set the framework for how we discuss it-- really understanding all the sources, thinking about the green premium, appreciating the miracle of the industrial economy and the scale of it and the low cost of it. That's what we've got to go and change. And so I decided, OK, this year, I'll have to do both the pandemic, global health, and climate discussion so I don't miss this special time.

ANDY SERWER: You certainly have a lot on your plate, Bill, and we really appreciate the time you've given us today. Bill Gates, thanks very much.

67,2021-02-18T10:30:20+00:00,15 Youngest Tech Billionaires,"In this article, we are going to talk about the 15 Youngest Tech Billionaires in the world. You can skip our detailed explanation of the criteria we used to rank these individuals in our list and go directly to the 5 Youngest Tech Billionaires.

Thanks to the technology revolution and hyper-connectivity, the world is experiencing an unprecedented phenomenon: the rise of young billionaires. A decade ago, it was a rarity to find a young self-made millionaire or billionaire in the lists of rich people worldwide. But the technology startup revolution that started in the U.S. has caused a domino effect across the world. According to data by WealthX, tech billionaires are doing better than the billionaires in other industries. The data suggest that there are 143 tech billionaires in the world, with an average worth of $6 billion each. Billionaires outside the tech sector have an average worth of $3 billion. What’s the reason of this big difference? The answer is given by legendary investor and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel in his bestseller “Zero To One.” Thiel believes that tech companies have an edge over other industries because technology products are easier to scale and grow and they also have big profit margins and low operations costs.

The Rise of Tech Billionaires

There were about 71 self-made billionaires aged below 40 in Forbes’ 2019 list of the world’s richest, a record. Out of these 71, 30 were from the technology industry, while 7 made a fortune in fashion and 7 were from the real estate sector. A cursory glance at the list would show you names of young tech billionaires like Stripe cofounder John Collison, Snapchat cofounder Evan Spiegel and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Also on the list was Jihan Wu, 35, a Chinese tech billionaire who cofounded Bitmain, one of the largest computer chip companies for Bitcoin mining. 5 Youngest Tech Billionaires

The rise of young tech billioanires is not only limited to the developed world. Developing nations in Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and Eastern Europe are also contributing their fair share to the lists of the young and wealthy. Some notable examples from India include Ankit Bhati, cofounder of ride-sharing company Ola Cabs; Ritesh Agarwal, cofounder of hospitality company Oyo Rooms; Sriharsha Majety, cofounder of online food ordering company Swiggy; and Flipkart’s Binny Bansal.

Story continues

The 21st century has brought with itself an unprecedented amount of wealth and innovation While millennials are still left out in dealing with their financial dilemmas, boomers are still holding on to their wealth that is mainly incorporated in the form of investments and real estate.

In this article, we are going to discuss 15 youngest tech billionaires. But first, let's see our criteria of ranking.

Age

Age is the most important factor that we are taking into account for our ranking.

Market Value of Company/Startup

Although net worth is an important factor, we have laid a greater emphasis on the market caps of the companies started by the billionaires on our list. Market value is a more pragmatic and prudent factor when compared with a billionaire’s wealth as it highlights the value they created.

Social Impact

Social impact gauges the impact a billionaire had on the society with their product or service. A billionaire who can create a radical new idea or product that adds value and solves problems will get a higher ranking on our list of 15 youngest tech billionaires. Youngest Tech Billionaires

Self-made billionaires

Inheriting wealth from one's parents does not have any weightage in our criteria. We chose only those individuals who started everything from scratch.

68,2021-02-18T01:32:18+00:00,Bill Gates: Texas Gov. is 'wrong' to blame wind turbines for outages,"Bill Gates, author of ‘How to Avoid a Climate Disaster’, joins Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer to discuss the freezing temperatures hitting the state of Texas.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone. I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to a Yahoo Finance special, Climate Crisis. I'm joined now by Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, former CEO of Microsoft, and author of the new book, ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."" Bill, welcome.

BILL GATES: Yeah-- great to be with you.

ANDY SERWER: So I want to start off by asking you about the weather. And right now, the US is experiencing a massive, highly unusual deep freeze. Is this due to climate change, do you think?

BILL GATES: Well, these events become more likely because of climate change because the normal wind patterns are broken down. And so a cold front can go further south more often than we would expect. So yeah, the extreme events are coming more often and with more force, including hurricanes, than before we started warming the earth.

ANDY SERWER: This recent storm has caused massive power outages in Texas. And the state's governor, Greg Abbott, blamed frozen wind turbines and said it shows the Green New Deal would ""be a deadly deal for the United States."" How would you respond to that, Bill?

BILL GATES: Well, in terms of the current situation, you know, he's actually wrong. The wind turbines-- you can make sure they can deal with the cold. It probably wasn't anticipated for the wind turbines that far south. But, you know, the ones up in Iowa and North Dakota are-- do have the ability to not freeze up.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Hello, everyone. I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to a Yahoo Finance special, Climate Crisis. I'm joined now by Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, former CEO of Microsoft, and author of the new book, ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."" Bill, welcome.

BILL GATES: Yeah-- great to be with you.

ANDY SERWER: So I want to start off by asking you about the weather. And right now, the US is experiencing a massive, highly unusual deep freeze. Is this due to climate change, do you think?

BILL GATES: Well, these events become more likely because of climate change because the normal wind patterns are broken down. And so a cold front can go further south more often than we would expect. So yeah, the extreme events are coming more often and with more force, including hurricanes, than before we started warming the earth.

ANDY SERWER: This recent storm has caused massive power outages in Texas. And the state's governor, Greg Abbott, blamed frozen wind turbines and said it shows the Green New Deal would ""be a deadly deal for the United States."" How would you respond to that, Bill?

BILL GATES: Well, in terms of the current situation, you know, he's actually wrong. The wind turbines-- you can make sure they can deal with the cold. It probably wasn't anticipated for the wind turbines that far south. But, you know, the ones up in Iowa and North Dakota are-- do have the ability to not freeze up.

Actually, the main capacity that's gone out in Texas is not the wind. It's actually some of the natural gas plants that were also not ready for these super cord temperatures. So even though, you know, viewing this as an attack on renewable energies, in this case, is wrong, in fact, the point he's making, which is that as you rely more and more on wind and solar, that reliability will be a challenge and you need-- you'll need three things to maintain reliability while driving renewables over 80%--

One is more transmission. So we have an open source model. We're going to show that if Texas had had slightly more on a connection, they wouldn't have had a problem.

Serial entrepreneurs start new companies, make them successful, and sell them to move on to their next startup. Serial entrepreneurship is on the rise in the U.S. Success stories of figures like Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Square founder Jim McKelvey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia, 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki and several others are fueling inspiration across the country among young people to launch startups. Data from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association suggest that venture capitalists invested a whopping $156.2 billion into domestic startups in 2020 alone.

Serial Entrepreneurship is a Tough Game

But starting and selling companies is not for everyone. Data from TechCrunch suggests that the chances of a startup being acquired at or after Series C are very small. To give you some context, making it to Series C is extremely difficult. TechCrunch’s report said that out of every 1,000 startups that successfully close a Pre-Series A funding round, only 400 make it to Series A.

Successful founders and venture capitalists are also helping startups grow and reach their goals. For example Jim McKelvey launched a startup accelerator SixThirty, which will back four financial-services startups each fall and spring and invest $100,000 a year.

Entrepreneurs who risk starting up a venture are rewarded with profits and growth opportunities if their idea becomes successful. But if their calculations and applications were not properly assessed, they could suffer great losses. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, takes risks repeatedly. A serial entrepreneur analyzes real problems and identifies the solutions for which a large number of customers are willing to pay. Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World

Unlike a traditional entrepreneur who prefers to build a company and stick with it until the end, a serial entrepreneur does not stop at a single venture. Steve Jobs is one of the perfect examples of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world. In 1976, college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computers Inc in a garage. In December 1980, Apple launched its initial public offering selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share. It was a massive hit by the end of the day, as the stock had increased in value by approximately 32%, leaving the company with a market value of $1.778 billion. Today, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) trades at $135.37 per share with a market cap of over $2 trillion. In 1985 Steve Jobs created NeXT, an operating system and business computer company which later on benefited the operating systems of Apple computers. In 1997, Apple bought NeXT for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. In 1986, the serial tech entrepreneur acquired the gold standard of the animated filmmaker, Pixar, for $5 million. In 2006, Jobs sold Pixar to Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) for over $7 billion. Today, Pixar Animated Studios is acknowledged as one of the world's most influential film studios.

The Antifragility of Serial Entrepreneurs

While chasing for success has always been the goal for many business founders, serial entrepreneurs are anti-fragile: they gain from failure. Studies show serial entrepreneurs have greater success than first-timers. As to the obvious reason, serial entrepreneurs have more experience in managing a business as it is natural for them to look for different ventures they could invest in. According to a Harvard Business School paper about ""Performance Persistence in Entrepreneurship"", serial entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed than first-time entrepreneurs or those who have failed in part because serial entrepreneurs ""exhibit persistence in selecting the right industry and time to start new ventures"".

Through the years, serial entrepreneurs have been perfecting their skills in building successful ventures. Another research to back it up was performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in which they observed thousands of startups over 25 years. The purpose of the study entitled ""Skill vs. Luck in Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital"" was precisely to understand whether the success of serial entrepreneurs stems from the skills they have perfected in their careers or from external factors. The study found that ""successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies"" and that ""skills are an important determinant of success for entrepreneurial start-ups"". The study also highlighted the key distinction between previously successful founders and formerly unsuccessful entrepreneurs: ""Entrepreneurs who have been successful in previous business are much more likely to succeed in current business than first-time entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs who have previously failed.""12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs

All evidence seems to point to the fact that one of the main skills of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world is to learn from their successes and failures to achieve more with their next venture.

What Happened: “Well, it’s important to say that what Elon did with Tesla is one of the greatest contributions to climate change anyone’s ever made,” the billionaire-philanthropist said on NYT opinion writer Kara Swisher’s twice-weekly podcast “Sway.”

“Underestimating Elon is not a good idea,” Gates added.

Why It Matters: The Microsoft co-founder's comments follow Musk's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast where he expressed a belief that Gates had a short position on Tesla stock, Electrek reported.

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird,” said Musk.

“People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them 'are you sure?' and they said 'yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla.' That didn’t work out too well.”

Last year, Gates had said that electric trucks would never be a “practical solution” for carrying heavy loads over large distances. Musk was dismissive of Gates’ knowledge of electric vehicles and said “he has no clue.”

On an earlier occasion, Musk had expressed displeasure over Gates’ purchase of a Porsche Taycan and described conversations with the former Microsoft executive as “underwhelming.”

Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 2.4% lower at $796.22 on Tuesday and fell 0.6% in the after-hours session. On the same day, Microsoft shares closed nearly 0.5% lower at $243.70 and declined 0.18% in the after-hours session.

Video Transcript

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: The video game industry is a multibillion dollar business, but it's not just the developers who are profiting off the games. Players are also profiting, including my next guest, who is proving that sometimes it really does pay to play. 24-year-old Chris ""SWAGG"" Lamberson is one of the most popular players of one of the most popular video games on the planet.

Happy to have him on the show. We're also joined by our tech editor, an avid gamer himself, I might add, Mr. Dan Howley. So SWAGG, I'm going to start with you. During this pandemic, what has happened to the gaming industry and your experience in particular?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: Yeah, I think the biggest-- it just blew up to a different stratosphere. I mean, you saw so many different cultures and-- yeah, like athletes, musicians, everyone came together and just everyone wants to be a gamer because there was nothing else to do. So you saw the gaming industry just boom.

And everybody just wanted to play video games because, I mean, everyone's in lockdown. So it's been crazy, and it's been awesome.

DAN HOWLEY: SWAGG, I was talking to Activision CEO recently about the growth of ""Call of Duty."" Obviously, I was watching some of your streams of ""Warzone,"" and I'm a big ""Warzone"" player, not great, not great at it, but I'm in there. I'm in there.

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: Nah, all good. All good, man.

DAN HOWLEY: But I guess, you know, as far as the game goes, where are you seeing it trend? And do you think that it's going to hold itself long term? Kind of-- you know, ""Fortnite"" was really super hot, and then we had ""Warzone"" come in and kind of take that over now. So do you see it holding on for a while? Or do you see another one coming soon?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: No, I definitely see it holding on for a while. I just saw recently that Activision actually said that, you know, ""Warzone"" is going to be their main focus. As long as they keep updating the game, I mean, it's free to play, it's an incredible game, the engine is awesome. So as long as they keep putting just content into it, it'll last for a really long time, very long longevity.

Story continues

DAN HOWLEY: I also just want to touch on, you know, when it comes to streaming, obviously diversity has to be part of the conversation in video games. And I kind of want to get your perspective on it, what you feel as far as Twitch streamers go in terms of diversity, whether or not there's enough representation across the spectrum.

I mean, video games, you know, they're for everyone right? So I guess, are you seeing that as far as Twitch streaming goes? Are you seeing enough representation? Or is it kind of still lopsided?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: No, it's definitely progressing. I know one of the biggest things that I actually noticed is that a lot of Black and Latino kids don't have, you know, PCs. A lot of them have, like, consoles. And so with the release of, like, these new gen consoles, the PS5, the new Xbox, you know, they're bringing abilities, new technology for a lot of people to actually stream who can't afford the equipment.

Because when I first started out, I couldn't afford a $2,000 PC. I couldn't afford a $300 monitor. But, like, now with this new technology, with new consoles coming out, it's going to allow people-- allow more diversity in people who really can't afford to stream, be able to stream with limited tech. And that's all you really need to get actually started in the gaming industry.

DAN HOWLEY: I just want to hit on one quick question. As far as the actual streaming fundamentals, a lot of people seem to think that it's just playing video games all day. But you're really working. You have to be on non-stop to entertain people, to make sure that they come back to your channel and subscribe and then perhaps donate. I guess, what is an average day look like for you when you're streaming?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: Yeah, no, so I usually wake up, figure out-- so I do YouTube and streaming. So I figure out what I do-- what YouTube video is going to have and stuff like that, what other content I'm going to have on other platforms. And then I usually go live about for seven, eight hours.

And don't get me wrong, I'm very blessed. I'm not finna sit here and act like it's the hardest job in the world. But it definitely does-- you can't just hop in here and think you're going to be successful, you know what I mean? It definitely takes work. I mean, if everyone-- I'm sure during the pandemic, so many people tried to be gamers and tried to be streamers, and it just didn't work out because it takes a lot more than just turning on a camera or just turning on a video game.

You know, you got to be entertaining, you have to be good. Like, you don't have to be good, but being good also helps. There's a whole different array of things. But yeah, it's definitely not easy. And it's taken me, I mean, almost seven years to perfect, so.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Yeah, I want to jump off that because I think a lot of people see the kind of money that content creators, these video game content creators can make. I was reading somewhere between 10 and $20,000 a month if you're really successful at it.

I guess your big moment came last year when esports came calling and asked you to join their team as a content creator. What would you tell folks who see that and are trying to get there and try to emulate you?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: I think the biggest advice I can give is enjoy the process. I think-- it took me six years to join the team of my dreams, you know what I mean? I've been watching FaZe Clan for so long. And I think that it's not so much always about the end goal, it's about just enjoying the whole process, you know, getting better at making videos, coming to every stream with different energy and just coming with something new.

And I think that's probably the biggest advice is just keep-- every day, become a better streamer, become a better gamer than you were the day before. I think towards the end, you'll just see more progress. And you never know what can happen.

DAN HOWLEY: OK, this is a question for me and probably the other gamers out there. What's your go-to loadout right now?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: Oh, man.

DAN HOWLEY: What are you rocking? Because I need some tips.

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: Nah, nah, nah. Right now, I think we're going AMAX, MAC-10. I think that's my-- that's my go-to loadout right now. I see a lot of players using the FFAR. What about you? What are you rocking right now?

DAN HOWLEY: I just started with the RAM just now. I'm trying to get-- I'm not good at sniping, I'm terrible. I always get taken out right away. I spent a lot of time in the gulag, like I said. But the MP7, you know--

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: It's cool, it's cool. Give the MAC-10 a go, man. I think you'll like it a lot.

DAN HOWLEY: I got to give it a shot. I got to give it a shot.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: This is like a whole other language, guys. I don't know. You two should just get together, play some video games. Sounds exciting, you're going to have to teach me.

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: Most definitely, most definitely. Oh, most definitely.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: But-- so just tell us, SWAGG, before we let you go. What are you most excited about in the near term in the industry? Anything new coming out or anything we should be looking-- that you're keeping an eye on?

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: I think-- like I said, with, like, a lot of these new consoles and stuff like that, I mean, we're just going to see just more players just coming from controller and just more diverse. You'll see-- like, in maybe in the next year, you'll see a top, you know, Black or Latino gamer who's number one. You know, they're just going to be so many new players coming to the game and just really being exposed. And I'm really excited to see where the future holds for gamers.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Yeah, it's definitely an exciting time to be in the midst of it all, which you are, SWAGG. So thanks so much for coming on. I know Dan was excited. Dan, you should just continue the conversation offline there with SWAGG. All right, guys.

DAN HOWLEY: If I could get tips.

KRIS ""SWAGG"" LAMBERSON: For sure.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Anywhere you can get them. And he's a good person to get him from. So listen, continued success to you, Chris ""SWAGG"" Lamberson. And Dan, thanks for joining us on that.

Video Transcript

- We talked about it a couple times throughout the last few hours, but a global chip shortage pressuring industries obviously from the tech space, but now the auto space really feeling the pinch here. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins us now. For more, Howley, on what we know, and I guess what we also don't know about this chip shortage and how far it goes and who really starts to feel the pain first-- I guess we're seeing it in the auto sector. But when does this result in something like a flagship Apple device getting delayed? And how concerned is the tech industry right now that this is going to drag on?

DAN HOWLEY: Oh, it's already hitting the tech industry. And this is really partially having to do with the pandemic and partially having to do with the US-China trade war. Companies have started stockpiling chips, or were actively stockpiling chips, like Apple. And Huawei was obviously doing that in China. For the auto space, it's an issue. And remember, these are all different semiconductors from different manufacturers. But what it comes down to is, are they making them for each individual industry? And how many can they put out for each individual industry? Because each industry needs its own specialized type of chip.

So for the auto space, obviously it's hitting there hard. We're seeing chip-- sorry-- plants having to idle. And then for the actual tech side of things-- you know, different tech companies looking at Microsoft and Sony here-- they're particularly hit hard with their new consoles because AMD is hit hard with a chip shortage that they're trying to deal with. Nvidia also dealing with chip shortages on their higher end products. And then obviously we're going to continue to see that cascade across the industry. PC makers are having issues already. Smartphone makers are having issues. So this is something that's going to continue for some time forward.

Story continues

- All right. I guess we don't have Julie Hymen. Howley, I do want to ask a little bit about the dynamics as they relate to kind of like national industrial policy, because we've sort of seen the outlines of that come up a little bit. You know, there was that huge guide that we saw from Taiwan Semiconductor-- I think it was almost a month ago now.

And there's been this sort of sense of, does the US need to be shoring up its own domestic production of semiconductors? And is that even feasible at this point kind of in the industrial process? I mean, is this a new-- I guess a new era, we could say, for big tech, where we're not worrying so much about software and apps and all that. But we're trying to actually become an industrial player again.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. It's almost like a backtracking to a degree as far as these kinds of processes are made. And you know, they were made in the US at certain points. Intel obviously wants to hold onto their fabrication capabilities. A lot of stockholders were saying that they should just outsource entirely to Taiwan Semiconductor and the like. But Intel said that they wanted to keep moving forward and producing their own chips.

I do think, at some point, we see some kind of movement in the direction that you're talking about, some kind of national assistance program or national kind of program where the chip makers are given certain benefits for producing in-house in the US. I think that's something that obviously an Obama-- sorry, Biden administration-- is talking about, and something that we've kind of had to discuss in the past, as well, as we've seen more offshoring of this.

There's also the issue of precious metals. That could be coming out of China in the future where they may want to hold off on certain defense sectors getting access to precious metals. Those are imported from China a lot. But there's also some in other areas of the world that can be accessed. I think it's going to be an ongoing conversation that the government tends to have. But for now, the immediate issue is these consumer goods and how companies can get more chips to them.

- All right. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley with a story I know we'll be staying on. But kind of started with the drama around TikTok and Oracle and whatever that nonsense was and now we're talking about a real thing, actually making chips and having rare earth metals kind of held back.

78,2021-02-16T10:32:12+00:00,Former SAC Capital Portfolio Manager Tor Minesuk’s Top 10 Stock Picks for 2021,"In this article, we discussed former SAC Capital Portfolio Manager Tor Minesuk's top 10 stock picks for 2021. You can skip our discussion of Tor Minesu's investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance and go directly to Former SAC Capital PM Tor Minesuk's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2021.

Founded in 2017, Tor Minesuk's Mondrian Capital Management saw massive gains in 2020, thanks to big investments in fastest-growing companies from information technology, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors. Its all top ten positions outperformed the broader market returns in 2020. Despite that, the hedge fund has made several changes in its 13F portfolio during the fourth quarter to align the stock positions according to the changing market trends.

The New York-based hedge fund has initiated positions in 17 stocks during the fourth quarter including the largest positions in ServiceNow (NASDAQ: NOW) and Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ: QRVO) and Adobe Inc (ADBE). In addition, Tor Minesuk has also added to its 10 existing positions.

The hedge fund likes to take advantage of short-term price movements instead of holding positions for the long term. The firm sold out its 20 stock positions during the fourth quarter and reduced its stake in 9 stocks.Former SAC Capital Portfolio Manager Tor Minesuk's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2021

Tor Minesuk, who also worked for Ken Griffin's Citadel for more than 2 years, has sold its entire stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) during the fourth quarter after initiating the position during the second quarter of 2019. The firm has benefited from its MSFT stake because shares of the tech giant rallied significantly in the past couple of quarters.

Similarly, the firm also took advantage of MongoDB, Inc (NASDAQ: MDB) share price gains by selling its entire stake in the fourth quarter. MDB accounted for 4.27% of the overall portfolio at the end of the third quarter. The New York-based hedge fund had created a position in MongoDB in the fourth quarter of 2018 when it was trading below $100. MDB shares are currently trading around $420 level.

Story continues

Besides past performance, Tor Minesuk continues showing confidence in technology, communication, and media companies. The investments in information technology stocks accounted for 75% of the overall 13F portfolio, according to the latest fillings. Consumer discretionary sectors represent 11% of the portfolio while investments in communication sectors stand around 6% of the portfolio. The majority of the companies in the fund’s portfolio are large-cap stocks.

While Tor Minesuk's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter's stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 111 percentage points. (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start examining former SAC Capital portfolio manager Tor Minesuk's top 10 stock picks for 2021 to determine whether these positions have the ability to outperform the broader market returns in 2021.

10. JD.Com (NASDAQ: JD)

Tor Minesuk's strategy of initiating a position in the Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) at the beginning of 2020 worked for his hedge fund. This is because shares of JD rallied more than 100% in 2020 and extended the upside momentum into 2021. Mondrian Capital Management has increased its stake by 13% in JD.com during the fourth quarter.

Argosy Investors, which generated 29.8% in select accounts in 2020, highlighted the strong business strategies of JD.com in an investor’s letter. Here’s what Argosy Investors stated:

“JD.com has been making conscious decisions to break its business up into its component parts, which in our opinion helps surface the value of each business. JD’s enterprise value is about USD $120 billion today. JD spun off its JD Health business worth USD $28 billion (like Teladoc in the US), may spin off its JD Cloud business (similar to AWS in the US), has sold shares in its JD Logistics business and is shooting for a valuation of USD$40 billion in 2021 via an IPO, and JD Digits which provides supply chain and consumer loans was expected to be valued at nearly USD $30 billion before Ant Financial was prevented by the Chinese government from completing its IPO. The combined values of these business segments within JD is about $98 billion, leaving $22 billion for JD’s core retail business (and its cloud business) which is on track for over USD $100 billion in sales this year and growing over 20% per year. Assuming a 5% long-term margin for JD Retail, that segment is generating USD $5 billion of operating profit (EBIT). Given their strong market position, investors could value JD’s retail business alone at 20x EBIT, valuing JD retail at $100 billion. By comparison, Amazon was valued at over $175 billion during the year in which it earned USD $100 billion in revenue, so we continue to believe JD is being undervalued, despite a more competitive environment with Alibaba in China than Amazon faces in the US.”

9. Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: ADI)

Mondrian Capital Management has also benefited from its Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: ADI) position during 2020 and 2021. The shares of chipmaker grew 35% in the last twelve months, almost double the S&P 500 index returns. Moreover, the company also offers hefty dividends to shareholders.

Its dividend yield is currently hovering around 1.62%. Its returns are fully backed by strong financial numbers. The company has generated double-digit growth in Q4 EPS and expects to sustain the financial growth momentum in 2021. Analog Devices is the ninth-largest stock holding of Tor Minesuk's 13F portfolio, accounting for 3.79% of the overall portfolio.

8. Amzon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Former SAC Capital portfolio manager Tor Minesuk's has also been holding a stake in the largest e-commerce platform Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) since the fourth quarter of 2018. The hedge fund is bullish on Amazon’s future prospects as the firm has raised its position in Amazon by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The e-commerce giant is among the biggest contributor to its 2020 performance. Shares of Amazon are up 54% in the last twelve months.

L1 Capital International Fund has also presented strong remarks about Amazon’s business strategies in an investor letter. Here is what L1 Capital International Fund stated:

“Several investments in the technology sector were trimmed on valuation grounds with the proceeds used to increase our investment in Amazon. Amazon’s successful flywheel business model and Amazon Web Services are well known. However, we believe the current share price under‑appreciates:

– The consistency and longevity of Amazon’s growth potential in its key businesses;

– The importance of additional revenue streams such as advertising which are high margin and growing rapidly; and

– The strengthening barriers to competition and competitive advantages arising from Amazon’s stepped‑up investment in logistics and other infrastructure.”

7. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU)

Tor Minesuk has expressed confidence in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) and added a big position in the stock during the fourth quarter, making it the seventh-largest stock holding of his hedge fund's 13F portfolio. Shares of Intuit outperformed the broader market index so far in 2021.

L1 Capital International Fund believes Intuit is a high-quality company. Here’s what L1 Capital stated in an investors letter:

“Intuit epitomises the consistency, predictability and longevity of growth we seek in high quality businesses. Intuit currently operates through 2 main divisions: Software for financial and business management as well as integrated payroll solutions, merchant payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses in the US and key global markets; and Do‑it‑yourself and assisted income tax preparation software products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada.""

6. Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE)

The visual graphics software company Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE) is the sixth-largest stock holding of Tor Minesuk’s portfolio. The hedge fund has initiated a position in Adobe Systems during the fourth quarter and it accounts for 4.60% of the overall portfolio. Shares of Adobe Systems are up 33% in the last twelve months.

Polen Capital Management, which returned 10.15% for the fourth quarter, highlighted few stocks including Adobe Systems in an investor letter. Here’s what Polen Capital Management stated:

“For the full year 2020, one of the top performers was Adobe, which we have owned for many years, continues to benefit from being the gold standards of software in its respective areas, and the current environment has only served to accelerate customer demand and need for their products and services.”

Let’s start examining former SAC Capital portfolio manager Tor Minesuk's top 10 stock picks for 2021 to determine whether these positions have the ability to outperform the broader market returns in 2021.

10. JD.Com (NASDAQ: JD)

Tor Minesuk's strategy of initiating a position in the Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) at the beginning of 2020 worked for his hedge fund. This is because shares of JD rallied more than 100% in 2020 and extended the upside momentum into 2021. Mondrian Capital Management has increased its stake by 13% in JD.com during the fourth quarter.

Argosy Investors, which generated 29.8% in select accounts in 2020, highlighted the strong business strategies of JD.com in an investor’s letter. Here’s what Argosy Investors stated:

“JD.com has been making conscious decisions to break its business up into its component parts, which in our opinion helps surface the value of each business. JD’s enterprise value is about USD $120 billion today. JD spun off its JD Health business worth USD $28 billion (like Teladoc in the US), may spin off its JD Cloud business (similar to AWS in the US), has sold shares in its JD Logistics business and is shooting for a valuation of USD$40 billion in 2021 via an IPO, and JD Digits which provides supply chain and consumer loans was expected to be valued at nearly USD $30 billion before Ant Financial was prevented by the Chinese government from completing its IPO. The combined values of these business segments within JD is about $98 billion, leaving $22 billion for JD’s core retail business (and its cloud business) which is on track for over USD $100 billion in sales this year and growing over 20% per year. Assuming a 5% long-term margin for JD Retail, that segment is generating USD $5 billion of operating profit (EBIT). Given their strong market position, investors could value JD’s retail business alone at 20x EBIT, valuing JD retail at $100 billion. By comparison, Amazon was valued at over $175 billion during the year in which it earned USD $100 billion in revenue, so we continue to believe JD is being undervalued, despite a more competitive environment with Alibaba in China than Amazon faces in the US.”

9. Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: ADI)

Mondrian Capital Management has also benefited from its Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: ADI) position during 2020 and 2021. The shares of chipmaker grew 35% in the last twelve months, almost double the S&P 500 index returns. Moreover, the company also offers hefty dividends to shareholders.

Its dividend yield is currently hovering around 1.62%. Its returns are fully backed by strong financial numbers. The company has generated double-digit growth in Q4 EPS and expects to sustain the financial growth momentum in 2021. Analog Devices is the ninth-largest stock holding of Tor Minesuk's 13F portfolio, accounting for 3.79% of the overall portfolio.

8. Amzon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Former SAC Capital portfolio manager Tor Minesuk's has also been holding a stake in the largest e-commerce platform Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) since the fourth quarter of 2018. The hedge fund is bullish on Amazon’s future prospects as the firm has raised its position in Amazon by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The e-commerce giant is among the biggest contributor to its 2020 performance. Shares of Amazon are up 54% in the last twelve months.

L1 Capital International Fund has also presented strong remarks about Amazon’s business strategies in an investor letter. Here is what L1 Capital International Fund stated:

“Several investments in the technology sector were trimmed on valuation grounds with the proceeds used to increase our investment in Amazon. Amazon’s successful flywheel business model and Amazon Web Services are well known. However, we believe the current share price under‑appreciates:

– The consistency and longevity of Amazon’s growth potential in its key businesses;

– The importance of additional revenue streams such as advertising which are high margin and growing rapidly; and

– The strengthening barriers to competition and competitive advantages arising from Amazon’s stepped‑up investment in logistics and other infrastructure.”

7. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU)

Tor Minesuk has expressed confidence in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) and added a big position in the stock during the fourth quarter, making it the seventh-largest stock holding of his hedge fund's 13F portfolio. Shares of Intuit outperformed the broader market index so far in 2021.

L1 Capital International Fund believes Intuit is a high-quality company. Here’s what L1 Capital stated in an investors letter:

“Intuit epitomises the consistency, predictability and longevity of growth we seek in high quality businesses. Intuit currently operates through 2 main divisions: Software for financial and business management as well as integrated payroll solutions, merchant payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses in the US and key global markets; and Do‑it‑yourself and assisted income tax preparation software products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada.""

6. Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE)

The visual graphics software company Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE) is the sixth-largest stock holding of Tor Minesuk’s portfolio. The hedge fund has initiated a position in Adobe Systems during the fourth quarter and it accounts for 4.60% of the overall portfolio. Shares of Adobe Systems are up 33% in the last twelve months.

Polen Capital Management, which returned 10.15% for the fourth quarter, highlighted few stocks including Adobe Systems in an investor letter. Here’s what Polen Capital Management stated:

“For the full year 2020, one of the top performers was Adobe, which we have owned for many years, continues to benefit from being the gold standards of software in its respective areas, and the current environment has only served to accelerate customer demand and need for their products and services.”

Momentum investing is one of the most fundamental quantitative investment strategies for investors seeking profit. Basically, it is the strategy of buying high and selling even high. The term is similar to Newton’s first law of motion which states that when an object is in motion it tends to stay in motion unless a force is applied to it. In relation, a market in motion tends to stay in motion. Basically, trends tend to continue.

The strategy dates back to 2004, when Chicago-based fund manager, Richard Driehaus turned the practice into a strategy. Although he was not the first to use the strategy, he is often called the father of momentum investing. He started buying stocks that already had good price moves and holding on to it as long as the upward price movement continues. He emphasized his discipline in selling the losers as soon as he sees a downward trend and re-investing the money in others upward trend stocks.

Investing in the time of an economic recession can be one of the hardest decisions for an investor given the market volatility. In the contrary, momentum investing goes against the market by taking advantage of positions in rising stocks and selling them the moment they show signs of going down. A momentum investor is more attracted to stocks that have rising prices as an upward trend may seem most likely in a certain period of time. The idea is based on the possibility of a stock that establishes a trend will continue in that direction rather than go against it.15 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Now

If an investor has the ability to identify sectors quickly and accurately, investing in momentum stocks can offer a great chance to gain a winning trade and take profits higher than regular trading opportunities over a short period of time. For instance, in a study by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman covering the US stock returns between 1965-1989, momentum was a significant factor that generated an outperformance of as much as 12.01% per year on average. In a separate study by Grundy and Martin in 2001, where they used NYSE and AMEX listed stocks, it was concluded that momentum profits were stable even after adjustment for dynamic risk exposure.

Based on our hedge fund sentiment data, we present to you the 15 best momentum stocks to buy now among 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:

15. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

No of HFs: 67

Total Value of HF Holdings: $8.17 Billion

TSLA is the 15th best momentum stock to buy now. At the end of September, a total of 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock. An insider purchased 1,250 shares at around $767 in February 2020. The stock is up 10% since then. Baron Opportunity Fund mentioned TSLA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells fully electric vehicles, solar products, and energy storage solutions. The company reported robust second quarter results, solidly ahead of market expectations, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macro-economic challenges. Indeed, in the second quarter, Tesla delivered almost 91,000 total vehicles – with strong unit level economics of 25.4% GAAP automotive gross profit margins – and another quarter of GAAP profitability and solid free cash flow (above $400 million). Moreover, Tesla recently announced a record of nearly 140,000 total vehicle deliveries for the third quarter. Despite global COVID-19 disruptions, our long-term expectations remain high due to Tesla’s differentiated products and healthy unit economics. Tesla has announced capacity expansions in Shanghai, China; Berlin, Germany; and Austin, Texas to support its short-term path to 1 million vehicles and its long-term goal of 20 million. Just a couple of weeks ago, Tesla held its Battery Day event, and presented a grand vision around its battery innovation and expanding its competitive advantages, including massively increasing internal battery production capacity (100 gigawatt-hours by 2022 and 3,000 by 2030), improving battery range (about 50%), and significantly lowering battery costs (cost per kilowatt-hour to decline by over 50%). We remain confident that Tesla will leverage its brand, technology leadership, and the electric vehicle secular trend to achieve sustainable long-term growth.”

14. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.21 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which had $840 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 1,000 shares at around $78 in April 2020. The stock is up 80% since then. L1 Capital International Fund mentioned NKE in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“We reduced our investment in Nike. Nike is performing extremely strongly in a challenging operating environment, gaining share and exceeding our expectations. However, the market has recognised Nike’s strong performance and after a substantial increase in the share price we consider the risk adjusted return potential only warrants a minimum position size.”

13. Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR)

No of HFs: 75

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.70 Billion

One of the biggest hedge fund savings stakes in the company is Dan Loeb’s Third Point which had $645 million invested in the stock at the end of September. An insider recently purchased 26,784 shares at around $226 in November 2020. The stock is up 4% since then. Del Principe O'Brien Financial Advisors mentioned DHR in its Q3 2020 investor letter:

“Danaher, which designs, manufactures, and markets life science, diagnostics, dental, environmental, and applied solutions, is a prime example of how to use the business strategy of “bolt-on” acquisitions. Led by capital allocation experts the Rales brothers, Danaher will purchase a company in a fragmented industry, create a strategic platform for providing a unique service, and then spin off the company when it can create even more value as an independent entity.

Since Danaher’s bolt-on acquisition of the biopharma business of General Electric’s Life Sciences division for $21.4 billion in March 2019, we have realized a gain of well over 100%. The move boosted Danaher’s stock from around $90 (our purchase price) to the $210s. A gain like this is one of the big upsides of investing in a serial acquirer.”

12. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO)

No of HFs: 80

Total Value of HF Holdings: $4.97 Billion

At the end of September, a total of 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock.

An insider recently purchased 100 shares at around $537 in December 2020. The stock is up 6% since then. Vulcan Value Partners mentioned NVDA in its 3Q 2020 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”

In April of this year, Qualcomm ended a lengthy and complicated legal battle with Apple over the licensing of Qualcomm’s chip technology in Apple’s mobile devices, including its iPhones. The settlement included a payout from Apple to Qualcomm rumored to be around $6 billion, as well as a six-year licensing agreement and a supply agreement guaranteeing that the chipmaker continue to provide its products to the largest company in the world. With this settlement and the expected increase in product shipments, Qualcomm anticipates an incremental earnings per share of $2. As Qualcomm shareholders, we were able to realize a gain of 54% over a short period of time.”

No of HFs: 104

Total Value of HF Holdings: $12.8 Billion

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of investing in high growth stocks paid off in 2020 as his 8 out of the top ten positions outperformed the broader market index. Indeed, the majority of his top 25 positions generated better performance than the S&P 500 index in 2020, thanks to investments in information technology, financial services, and consumer discretionary stocks. His investment firm has also been holding positions in fast-growing companies from the healthcare and communications sectors.

In addition to investing in the fastest-growing companies, the firm also likes to buy depressed stocks that have strong fundamentals. The firm believes in the demand and supply idea when it comes to pricing any stock. Fisher Asset Management, which is employing several teams of research analysts for finding the best investment opportunities, created positions in 118 stocks during the fourth quarter.

In addition, the firm likes to hold a stake for the long-term to benefit from share price gains and dividends. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s asset management firm added to its 388 existing positions during the fourth quarter.

The average time held for the top ten stocks stands around 11.6 quarters while the time held for the top 20 stocks averages around 13.65 quarters.

Billionaire Ken Fisher sold out 48 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2020 and reduced his positions in 378 stocks. Overall, the firm held a position in 957 stocks, according to the latest 13F filings. Ken Fisher - FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT

Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management

Founded in 1979 and incorporated in 1986, Fisher Asset Management ended the fourth quarter with $133 billion in 13F portfolio market value, up significantly from $114 billion in the previous quarter and $98 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Ken Fisher is the heart and soul of Fisher Asset Management and currently serving as the executive chairman and co-chief investment officer. He is the son of legendary investor Philip A. Fisher. Ken Fisher is also a columnist and author. He has written several books on finance.

Story continues

While Ken Fisher’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start examining billionaire Ken Fisher’s top ten stock picks to determine returns in 2020 and what are the future prospects of these positions. Its top ten stock holdings account for almost 32% of the overall portfolio.

10. Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM)

The customer relationship software developer Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is the tenth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. The firm has benefited from its large position because shares of CRM rallied almost 28% in the last twelve months compared to the S&P 500 growth of almost 17%.

Alger Spectra Fund also believes that Salesforce is a good stock to buy and hold for the long-term. Here is what Alger Spectra Fund stated in an investors letter:

“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”

Polen Capital also talked about CRM in its Q4 investor letter:

“We discussed Salesforce.com in the third quarter, but the former went from our top contributor last quarter to the largest detractor this quarter. The double-digit share price decline in the quarter seemed mostly driven by investor reaction after Salesforce announced it would acquire Slack, a collaboration software company, for approximately $28 billion, a high purchase price. While the purchase price is higher than we expected, we believe Slack and its functionality fit well strategically with Salesforce’s suite of enterprise software offerings. At a high-level, Slack offers the ability to make both Salesforce’s and other third-party applications work better for their respective customers. In addition, Salesforce’s world-class selling organization and already large customer base should be beneficial for Slack’s subscription revenue growth, which has been more customer-referral based up to this point. It is too early to know if this acquisition will prove to be a smart allocation of investor capital. That said, Slack has a unique value proposition and was growing nicely on a standalone basis. We believe the Salesforce-Slack strategic vision is on point; and although the purchase price is high in absolute dollars, it represents less than 15% of Salesforce’s market capitalization.

We maintain an optimistic view of Salesforce’s business, its competitive positioning within enterprise software, and the rationale behind the Slack acquisition. We expect strong, continued earnings and free cash flow growth many years into the future.”

9. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE)

Billionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of holding a position in Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has also added to its performance in 2020. Shares of Adobe rallied 34% in the last twelve months, thanks to strong demand for its products. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.18% of the overall portfolio.

Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors stated in an investor’s letter that Adobe is likely to perform well despite pandemic related challenges. Here is what Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors said:

“We purchased Adobe, the leading provider of content creation software. Adobe is a software company with a recurring revenue stream, which should insulate it from some of the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

Polen Capital also talked about ADBE in its Q4 investor letter:

“Adobe has been a strong performer since our initial purchase in early 2016 and has since compounded annually over 40%. This year has been no exception, with the business performing superbly and the stock appreciating by over 50%. CEO Shantanu Narayen stated, “This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe.” In addition to consistent and recurring double digit revenue growth, its margin expansion has significantly boosted its earnings power. Non-GAAP operating margins have expanded by over 550 bps in the past year. At the same time, we also believe that CEO Narayen deserves more credit for his capital allocation prowess. He has made sound acquisitions that have boosted the value proposition of his company’s products while strengthening the competitive advantages of the business.”

8. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surged almost 40% in the last twelve months on the back of increasing demand for digital ads. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 2.19% of the overall portfolio.

Giverny Capital Asset Management LLC claims that Alphabet needs to be disciplined in its spending. Here is what Giverny Capital Asset Management stated in an investors letter:

“Alphabet is our largest holding. We’re biased, but we’d argue that Alphabet is reasonably priced. It earns significant profit from travel-related searches, which are way down this year. Travel spending figures to roar back at some point, possibly soon. Alphabet also spends extravagant amounts on R&D and capital spending as it finances younger ventures. Those other businesses, which include YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars and cloud computing centers, plus research in artificial intelligence, should eventually generate meaningful returns for shareholders. Or at worst, they will consume less investment over time. If Alphabet simply exercises discipline over investment spending for a few years as travel advertising rebounds and the core search business grows, the resulting free cash flow should generate satisfactory returns for owners.”

7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM)

The chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best performing stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. This is because shares of TSM jumped 135% in the last twelve months. In addition, the firm has also been bagging big dividends from Taiwan Semiconductor. The company offers a dividend yield of 1.31% despite strong share price gains in the last twelve months.

First Eagle Investment Management claims that Taiwan Semiconductor is set to expand its market share in the days ahead. Here is what First Eagle Investment Management stated in an investors letter:

“Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) traded higher during the quarter on signs that its total addressable market was poised to expand. Intel announced that it was facing delays in the manufacture of its next-generation chips and may contract out the work to third parties, opening the door for a large-scale chip “foundry” like TSMC to pick up some of the business. Foundries make chips designed and named by other companies; TSMC already produces certain chips for Intel.”

6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA)

Despite concerns over regulatory issues, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) stock price managed to outperform the broader market index. Shares of Alibaba are up 21% in the past twelve months, meaning Fisher Asset Management has benefited from its stake. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.43% of the overall portfolio.

Polen Capital Management, a value-driven, concentrated, long-term investment management firm, highlighted few stocks including Alibaba in an investor’s letter. Here is what Polen Capital Management stated:

“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier-one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”

85,2021-02-12T21:34:48+00:00,"Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm Protest Nvidia’s Acquisition of Arm Ltd.","(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s largest technology companies are complaining to U.S. antitrust regulators about Nvidia Corp.’s acquisition of Arm Ltd. because the deal will harm competition in an area of the industry that is vital to their businesses.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are among companies worried about the $40 billion deal and are urging antitrust officials to intervene, said people familiar with the process who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. At least one of the companies wants the deal killed. Nvidia shares fell as much as 3.1% in New York trading on Friday.

The acquisition would give Nvidia control over a critical supplier that licenses essential chip technology to the likes of Apple Inc., Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and China’s Huawei Technologies Co.

U.K.-based Arm is known as the Switzerland of the industry because it licenses chip designs and related software code to all comers, rather than competing against semiconductor companies. The concern is that if Nvidia owns Arm, it could limit rivals’ access to the technology or raise the cost of access.

Nvidia has argued that the purchase price alone means it has no incentive to mess with that neutrality but some rivals and Arm customers are unconvinced.

“As we proceed through the review process, we’re confident that both regulators and customers will see the benefits of our plan to continue Arm’s open licensing model and ensure a transparent, collaborative relationship with Arm’s licensees,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “Our vision for Arm will help all Arm licensees grow their businesses and expand into new markets.” Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Arm declined to comment. CNBC reported Qualcomm’s objections earlier.

Before the deal can close, Nvidia must get through a long review process by antitrust officials in the U.S., U.K., European Union and China. Government agencies globally are in the process of reaching out to those they believe may be affected by the transaction.

Story continues

A groundswell of opposition from large tech companies may make it difficult to win approval, delay the process or force concessions that change the value of Arm to Nvidia. This is also a risk for SoftBank Group Corp., the current owner of Arm. The Japanese conglomerate has been trying to sell some assets to pay down debt and buy back stock.

In the U.S., the deal is under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which has opened an in-depth investigation of the merger and has sent information demands to third parties, according to a person familiar with the matter. The FTC declined to comment.

The changing leadership of the FTC could make winning approval tougher for Nvidia. The commission is generally split 2-2 along party lines at the moment, with Democratic commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter holding the acting chair position. Power will shift to the Democrats when U.S. President Joe Biden picks two candidates to fill an open seat and the seat held by Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who has been nominated to take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Deals like Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm, known as vertical mergers, are typically seen as less worrisome in the eyes of antitrust enforcers because the companies don’t compete head to head. But that view has come under fire from advocates of more aggressive antitrust enforcement who say regulators have downplayed the competitive harm from such deals.

Slaughter’s elevation signals a tougher approval process for vertical deals. Before taking over the agency, Slaughter criticized new guidelines issued last year by the FTC and the Justice Department outlining how the agencies would evaluate vertical deals. She said the guidelines overemphasize the potential benefits of such mergers and are “inexplicably mute” about the harms.

In December, Slaughter and Chopra said companies should no longer rely on the guidelines as an indication of how the FTC will police vertical deals.

“Moving forward, we need to aggressively enforce against the harms of vertical mergers,” they wrote. “We look forward to turning the page on the era of lax oversight and to beginning to investigate, analyze, and enforce the antitrust laws against vertical mergers with vigor.”

You can skip our discussion about Chilton's investment philosophy, his hedge fund's gains and history and go directly to Billionaire Richard Chilton's Top 5 Stock Picks.

Richard L. Chilton, Jr. established Chilton Investment Company in 1992 with the strategy of generating attractive returns by investing in low volatility stocks. Chilton’s hedge fund prefers holding stocks for a long term to enjoy dividends and steady growth. The fund's top ten stock holdings account for more than half of its overall 13F portfolio value.

However, it doesn’t mean the firm falls in love with stocks blindly. A veteran of Merrill Lynch, Alliance Capital, and Allen & Company, Chilton seeks to adjust portfolios according to the market trends.

For instance, the hedge fund initiated a position in 13 stocks and added to its 70 existing positions during the September quarter while it exited position from 11 stocks and reduced its stake in 42 stocks. CHILTON INVESTMENT COMPANY

Richard Chilton of Chilton Investment Company

Billionaire Richard L. Chilton’s strategy of holding a position for a long time worked over the last three decades. His hedge fund's compound annual return remains in the teen-digit territory since inception. Its Flagship Strategy fund returned an 18.57% in 2013, 13.99% in 2015 and 12.18% in 2018. The hedge fund saw only a few down years in its history, with the most recent loss of 13.66% in 2016.

Chilton Investment Company’s strategy of diversifying its investments across several sectors has been paying off. The materials sector accounted for 18% of the overall portfolio at the end of the September quarter while the billionaire investor also looks bullish on the consumer discretionary stocks. He also seeks to take advantage of robust growth in the information technology sector. Finance and industrial sectors accounted for 13% and 10% of the overall portfolio at the end of the September quarter.

Chilton has a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance and Economics from Alfred University. He grew up in New Jersey.

While Richard Chilton's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter's stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 111 percentage points. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.

Let’s start examining billionaire Richard Chilton's top 10 stock picks to determine whether Chilton Investment Company has extended its winning track record in 2020 and how its stock positions would perform in 2021. We used Chilton Investment's 13F data disclosed for the third quarter of 2020.

10. Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE: MTD)

Chilton Investment Company has been holding a position in Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE: MTD) since 2016 and it appears that the hedge fund has gained from its investment. This is because shares of MTD rallied more than 290% in the past five years and 60% in the last twelve months. It is the tenth-largest stock holding of Chilton’s hedge fund, accounting for 3.46% of the overall 13F portfolio.

Baron Asset Fund, which returned 8.43% for the third quarter, said in their investor letter that Mettler-Toledo International is a smart long-term buy. Here is what Baron Asset Fund stated:

“Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. is the world’s largest provider of weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. Shares contributed to performance after reporting second-quarter results with sales and earnings, as well as reinstated 2020 guidance, ahead of investor expectations. We continue to believe Mettler is an exceptionally well-managed business with multiple levers available, including demonstrated pricing power, to compound earnings at attractive rates.”

9. Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG)

The hedge fund has also benefited from its big stake in Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG). Shares of environmental and facilities services provider rallied 110% in the past five years despite underperformance in the last twelve months. However, Chilton Investment saw the underperformance as a buying opportunity. The firm has raised its stake by 9% in the September quarter to 3.67% of the overall portfolio.

In addition to share price performance, Chilton Investment has also been bagging big dividends from Republic Services. The company has raised its dividends in the last seventeen successive years. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, yielding around 1.85%.

8. Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS)

The hedge fund initiated a position in Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ: CTAS) in 2018. Cintas' share price grew 18% in the last twelve months while shares are up 288% in the past five years.

Diamond Hill Capital said in an investor’s letter that Cintas is likely to see a negative impact of the pandemic. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital stated:

“Cintas Corp. provides U.S. businesses with uniform rental services and restroom cleaning, first aid, safety, and fire protection goods and services. We re-initiated a short position in Cintas as we believe the stock price does not reflect the likelihood its results will be hard hit by increases in unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) is the long-running stock holding of Chilton Investment Company. The firm first initiated a position in COST in 2010 and it currently accounts for 4.48% of the overall portfolio. Costco's stock price surged 16% in the last twelve months, extending the ten years gains to 400%.

Saturna Capital Corporation highlighted a few stocks in their investor letter, and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) is one of them. Here is what Saturna Capital Corporation stated:

“For those not signed up for Amazon Prime, there’s still Costco, another firm in an enviable position when consumers are stocking for hard times.”

6. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP)

Billionaire Chilton’s strategy of holding a position in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) worked for the hedge fund in 2020. The hedge fund first initiated a stake in Union Pacific in 2011 and it accounted for 4.64% of the overall portfolio at the end of the September quarter. Union Pacific stock price rose 20% in the last twelve months, extending the five years gains to 187%.

Videogame Space Poised to Grow: 4 Stocks to Buy

After an eventful 2020, the videogame industry is on fire this year too. On Feb 8, Electronic Arts said that it will buy Glu Mobile in a bid to strengthen its mobile platform with an additional range of games.

This is Electronic Arts’ second acquisition in two months. That said, the overall videogame industry has been doing well, thanks to the pandemic, which has kept millions at home with no other entertainment options available.

Electronic Arts on a Buying Spree

Electronic Arts will be buying Glu Mobile for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of the year. Electronic Arts has made an offer of $12.50 in cash per share, marking a premium of 33% to its closing price on Feb 8.

The acquisition is in a bid to bolster its gaming range and attract more female gamers through Glu Mobile’s most popular titles like Design Home, Covet Fashion, and MLB Tap Sports Baseball and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.

That said, Electronic Arts has been on an acquisition spree. The company acquired UK-based Codemasters for $1.2 billion. The announcement comes just days after Electronic Arts raised its annual sales outlook, as it has been riding high on the success of some of its popular sports titles including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21.

Videogame Industry on a High

The videogame industry has been on a tear over the past one year, especially after the coronavirus outbreak. According to market research firm NPD Group, videogame sales hit $56.9 billion in 2020 in the United States, jumping 27% from the year earlier. This is also the highest sales generated ever.

Story continues

Spending on hardware touched $5.3 billion, surging 35% year over year and hitting its highest level since 2011. As more people stayed at home they spent more time on the consoles or mobiles, playing games. Experts believe that sales will continue to soar in 2021 following the recent launch of next-generation console games like Xbox by Microsoft and Sony’s Playstation 5. It can thus be said that videogames will continue to dominate the entertainment space at least till the time the coronaviurus vaccine proves to be effective and the fears subside.

92,2021-02-11T18:12:07+00:00,"Ivanti Software, Inc. -- Moody's affirms Ivanti Software's B3 CFR, outlook stable","Rating Action: Moody's affirms Ivanti Software's B3 CFR, outlook stableGlobal Credit Research - 11 Feb 2021New York, February 11, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") affirmed Ivanti Software, Inc.'s (""Ivanti"") B3 Corporate Family Rating (CFR) and B3-PD Probability of Default Rating (PDR). Concurrently, Moody's affirmed the B2 ratings on the company's first lien bank credit facilities, assigned a B2 rating to Ivanti's incremental $440 million first lien term loan and affirmed the Caa2 rating on Ivanti's second lien term loan. The outlook remains stable.Net proceeds from the incremental issuance, along with $25 million of new cash equity, will be used to fund Ivanti's acquisition of Cherwell Software (""Cherwell"") and add cash to the balance sheet. Cherwell, a provider of IT service management (ITSM) and enterprise service management (ESM) software and related solutions, is expected to contribute approximately $101 million of revenue and $23 million of run-rate pro forma EBITDA to Ivanti. Cherwell's strong product offerings in ITSM and ESM, in addition to its large existing customer base, will enhance Ivanti's product portfolio and diversity.Affirmations:..Issuer: Ivanti Software, Inc..... Corporate Family Rating, Affirmed B3.... Probability of Default Rating, Affirmed B3-PD....Senior Secured 1st Lien Bank Credit Facility, Affirmed B2 (LGD3)....Senior Secured 2nd Lien Bank Credit Facility, Affirmed Caa2 (LGD6)Assignments:..Issuer: Ivanti Software, Inc.....Senior Secured 1st Lien Term Loan, Assigned B2 (LGD3)Outlook Actions:..Issuer: Ivanti Software, Inc.....Outlook, Remains StableRATINGS RATIONALEIvanti's B3 CFR reflects the company's very high leverage, aggressive financial policies and significant execution risks associated with the acquisition and integration of Cherwell, MobileIron and Pulse Secure. Though weakly positioned in the B3 rating category, Ivanti benefits from its strong niche market position in enterprise endpoint management, ITSM and security software, high proportion of recurring revenues and very high profitability. Ivanti's primary products face competition from much larger companies including Microsoft Corporation, BMC Software, International Business Machines Corporation, ServiceNow and Broadcom Corporation (Symantec and CA), as well as numerous other niche players.Ivanti has faced challenges through the recession brought on by the coronavirus outbreak, particularly in its service offerings. New license sales have also declined in 2020 though this result was expected as the company continues to grow its SaaS and subscription offerings. While Ivanti's revenues have declined modestly in 2020, Moody's expects that over the long term, the company has the potential to grow in the low to mid-single digit percent range.Based on preliminary results for December 31, 2020 and pro forma for the acquisitions of Cherwell, MobileIron and Pulse Secure, Moody's adjusted leverage was over 10x. When adjusting for certain one-time expenses and actioned synergy items, leverage was approximately 7.5x. If Ivanti achieves its sizable cost reductions during the acquisition integrations and grows revenues in the mid-single digit percent range, leverage could decline to below 7x over the next 12-18 months. Moody's expects that Ivanti will maintain positive annualized free cash flow to debt of approximately 1-3% through 2022.Moody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under our ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. Owned by private equity funds associated with TA Associates and Clearlake Capital, Ivanti will likely maintain an aggressive financial strategy, including potential debt funded M&A activity and dividend payments.The stable outlook reflects Ivanti's good liquidity and Moody's expectation that over the next 12-18 months Ivanti will grow EBITDA through a combination of cost reduction activities and organic growth across the consolidated business such that leverage will decline below 7x.Ivanti's good liquidity is supported by expectations for a cash balance of approximately $80 million at the close of the transaction, an undrawn $175 million revolving credit facility and modest but positive free cash flow over the next year.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSRatings could be downgraded if Ivanti is not on track to reduce leverage below 7x over the next 12-18 months or if free cash flow generation is expected to be negative on other than a temporary basis. Ivanti's ratings could also be downgraded if the company were to pursue another debt funded acquisition before completing current acquisition integrations or generating free cash flow (GAAP operating cash flow -- capex).Though unlikely in the next 12-18 months, ratings could be upgraded if Ivanti successfully integrates the acquisitions, demonstrates consistent organic growth, and sustains Moody's adjusted leverage below 6x while also generating cash flow of approximately 5% of total gross debt.Ivanti Software, Inc. is a provider of IT operations management software and security software to global enterprise customers. The company is headquartered in Utah and owned by funds affiliated with private equity sponsors Clearlake Capital and TA Associates.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Software Industry published in August 2018 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1130740.

94,2021-02-11T14:00:15+00:00,"U.S. Health Giants Form Startup to Share, Analyze Patient Data","(Bloomberg) -- Fourteen of the largest U.S. health systems, led by Providence, have formed a startup to pool patient information, aiming to streamline efforts to analyze anonymous data to improve care, develop better therapies and drugs, and promote more equitable treatment of underrepresented groups.

Called Truveta, the Seattle-based startup is led by former Microsoft Corp. executive Terry Myerson, who ran the software maker’s Windows business. It will combine records representing about 13% of U.S. hospitals, which will be anonymized to protect confidentiality, said Rod Hochman, Providence chief executive officer and chair-elect of the American Hospital Association. The venture, which is co-owned by the participating hospital systems, includes Chicago-based CommonSpirit Health, Tenet Healthcare, Trinity Health, Bon Secours Mercy Health and New York’s Northwell Health.

The goal is to let Truveta backers, as well as researchers at other institutions and in government, run analyses and use machine learning to draw conclusions from the massive volume of data the systems generate. Often researchers at each institution face a shortage of examples within their own data sets when looking for patterns, particularly for rarer conditions or specific types of cancer, or trials on drugs and therapies don’t include enough participants from minority groups who may have different outcomes. The challenge has become particularly clear during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hochman said .

“Nothing has pointed it out more than the pandemic that we have now,” he said. “The dearth of data is just making trying to do health care miserable.”

Truveta plans to make money from selling access to this data. Projects will have to meet ethical guidelines determined by a committee of doctors, scientists and patients the company plans to set up — even with patients’ names removed from the data, ethical questions will be thorny. “We want to enable ethical research by everyone against this unprecedented, statistically significant insight into U.S. health care,” Myerson said. “Pharmaceutical companies, these 14 health systems, other health systems, public health.”

Story continues

Some patients may be concerned about their information being used in this way. Other medical data aggregators are already trying to profit from health data, and de-identified data derived from patients is routinely bought and sold without most people ever realizing it. Once names, addresses and other identifiable characteristics are stripped out, the information is free from patient privacy rules and can be used freely.Myerson said that as Truveta ramps up, providers will add notifications about what it collects to the health information forms that patients sign advising them of their rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which governs health-care privacy practices in the U.S. “Part of the goal is helping people understand the greater good and what this can do for them as a patient and improve their care,” he said. Hochman wants Truveta’s data collection to help with health-equity issues — some other databases rely on health insurance records and are disproportionately white and leave out the uninsured, he said. Truveta’s records cover all 50 U.S. states and a variety of demographics.

Truveta, founded last year, has 53 employees and is hiring quickly. Myerson won’t say what technologies and software programs it will use to organize and store the data.

Health care was slower than many industries to switch from paper to digital records, with many U.S. practices and hospitals shifting only after the government offered billions of dollars in incentives. But stores of digital data — prescriptions, medical procedures, insurance claims — have grown rapidly. Companies are competing to collect and package medical data stripped of identifying information.

Such data is used by drug companies trying to develop new therapies, and health plans and medical providers trying to make care more efficient. One leading health data company, IQVIA Holdings Inc., pegs the addressable market at $230 billion in its filings. IQVIA boasts data from 800 million patient records, spanning 35 petabytes and sourced from more than 150,000 suppliers, the company said.

Other large stores of health data in the U.S. come from health plans analyzing the millions of claims they process. Blue Health Intelligence, a licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, draws on data from 200 million Americans, according to the company’s website. The nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute uses data from commercial health plans on 55 million people, and 40 million from Medicare, to better understand health-care spending trends. IBM Watson Health has also acquired health data providers, such as Truven Health Analytics in 2016.

On Feb 8, Electronic Arts, Inc (EA) said that it will buy Glu Mobile, Inc. (GLUU) in a bid to strengthen its mobile platform with an additional range of games.

This is Electronic Arts’ second acquisition in two months. That said, the overall videogame industry has been doing well, thanks to the pandemic, which has kept millions at home with no other entertainment options available.

Electronic Arts on a Buying Spree

Electronic Arts will be buying Glu Mobile for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of the year. Electronic Arts has made an offer of $12.50 in cash per share, marking a premium of 33% to its closing price on Feb 8.

The acquisition is in a bid to bolster its gaming range and attract more female gamers through Glu Mobile’s most popular titles like Design Home, Covet Fashion, and MLB Tap Sports Baseball and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.

That said, Electronic Arts has been on an acquisition spree. The company acquired UK-based Codemasters for $1.2 billion. The announcement comes just days after Electronic Arts raised its annual sales outlook, as it has been riding high on the success of some of its popular sports titles including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21.

Videogame Industry on a High

The videogame industry has been on a tear over the past one year, especially after the coronavirus outbreak. According to market research firm NPD Group, videogame sales hit $56.9 billion in 2020 in the United States, jumping 27% from the year earlier. This is also the highest sales generated ever.

Spending on hardware touched $5.3 billion, surging 35% year over year and hitting its highest level since 2011. As more people stayed at home they spent more time on the consoles or mobiles, playing games. Experts believe that sales will continue to soar in 2021 following the recent launch of next-generation console games like Xbox by Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Sony Corporation’s SNE Playstation 5. It can thus be said that videogames will continue to dominate the entertainment space at least till the time the coronaviurus vaccine proves to be effective and the fears subside.

If you want to skip our discussion of the future of the software industry, analysts' predictions about software companies and job creation in the space, go directly to 5 fastest-growing software companies companies.

Software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. According to data by Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected to reach $4 trillion in 2021. Companies worldwide are embracing automation, Cloud computing, data analytics, websites, social media and AI to enhance their business and capture their customers online. This is driving the growth of software companies, especially SaaS. Data from U.S. Department of Labor shows that software is one of the fastest-growing industries when it comes to job creation. Jobs in computer and information technology as a whole are expected to grow 11% from 2019 through 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. Specifically in the software space, jobs are expected to grow by 22% through 2029, must faster than the average. To quote Marc Andreessen, software is eating the world.

Software companies create and build different programs that assist companies and individuals to solve key problems. Software companies are offering products and services in almost all walks of human life, including finance, entertainment, education, shopping, sports, military and healthcare. The coronavirus crisis fueled growth in the industry as companies scrambled to move their operations online: schools needed education software; retailers looked for ways to increase their online sales; banks started creating secure and user-friendly apps to allow customers perform their transactions by staying at home; and governments increased their IT spending to get rid of age-old ways of doing business.

IT jobs pay higher than most of the jobs in other industries. IT companies are also giving a boost to overall productivity. These factors are pushing GDP growth in the U.S. A report by the BSA Foundation shows that the software industry accounted for $1.6 trillion of the total $20.5 trillion U.S. GDP in 2018.

Story continues 15 Fastest-Growing Software Companies

The growth of software companies could be gauged from the fact that The Big Five — Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) — had a combined valuation of $3.3 trillion, and accounted for about 40% of the value of the Nasdaq 100, as of 2017. Other than these giants, software companies like Salesforce, Shopify, Palantir, ServiceNow, PayPal, Square and Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO) are posting explosive growth numbers as well. The core reason for this growth and dominance is the fact that these companies are solving key problems and offering solutions that are full of value. In the words of legendary investor Peter Thiel, they have become monopolies by virtue of the value and satisfaction they give to their customers. Software companies also grow fast because they have low marginal costs and big potential to scale.

We had considered the company for the inception portfolio but decided to wait and watch it as we had concerns about how low oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainty back in March might affect their business. We have since been impressed with the company’s ability to navigate the tough macro environment, and oil prices have improved. We believe it has been able to deliver very attractive growth despite the macro uncertainty, giving us more confidence to start a position during the quarter.

RV Capital in their Q4 2020 investor letter said that they saw a spectacular value in Slack Technologies, Inc. and acquired a position in the company. Here is what RV Capital stated:

""We became co-owners in Slack, a channels-based communication service for businesses. In an unexpected twist, a few months later it was acquired by Salesforce.com at roughly a 50% premium to what we had paid.

In accordance with my usual practice, I was planning on writing about our investment in Slack. By laying out my investment hypothesis at the onset of an investment, I hope to enable investors to assess in hindsight whether it worked (or not) because of a plausible investment philosophy consistently applied. Given that Slack has effectively already played out as an investment, this rationale has gone. After all, anyone can make a successful investment decision look smart after the fact.

There is one element of my Slack investment thesis that I would like to lay out as it neatly illustrates an idea in my first-half letter and has not yet played out. I wrote then that I wanted to invest more in “early-stage, listed companies”. What I meant by this are companies whose moat is not yet fully developed, but not so undeveloped that it is difficult to say if they will ever have one. I described early-stage companies as possessing:

The kernel of an idea (however unformed), which – if you squint – you can imagine creating a new paradigm in decades to come.

Slack was the type of company I had in mind when I wrote this. Its moat in its core business of providing channels-based communication within companies is well developed. It benefits from a network effect (the more employees on Slack, the higher the value they derive from it), a broad developer ecosystem (thousands of integrations have been built for Slack) and switching costs (Slack becomes tightly interwoven into a company’s workflow through said integrations).

What really got me excited – the new paradigm – is “Slack Connect”. Connect is a feature that allows companies to extend Slack beyond their own organisation to external partners. Connect has not yet achieved viral growth – the moat is not yet developed.”

Veeva’s key solutions are Commercial Cloud products, offering multi-channel customer relationship management software, and Veeva Vault, offering regulated content management for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Shares of Veeva performed strongly after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal second quarter 2021 results and raised its fiscal-year 2021 earnings and billings guidance. Veeva’s key growth driver continues to be strong adoption of Veeva Vault, with particular strength in the fiscal second quarter in its Quality Suite and Clinical Trial Management system. Veeva is making good progress on its recent acquisitions of Crossix, which provides a platform for optimizing health care marketing, and Physicians World. which provides a physicians’ speaker bureau. Since the earlier days of the pandemic in March, Veeva has offered its Veeva CRM Engage products to life sciences customers for free to enable virtual sales visits.

Finally, Veeva announced the formation of a board committee to explore the conversion of Veeva into a for-profit public-benefit corporation. Veeva would be the first public company to make this change.

If you want to skip our discussion of the future of the software industry, analysts' predictions about software companies and job creation in the space, go directly to 5 fastest-growing software companies companies.

Software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. According to data by Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected to reach $4 trillion in 2021. Companies worldwide are embracing automation, Cloud computing, data analytics, websites, social media and AI to enhance their business and capture their customers online. This is driving the growth of software companies, especially SaaS. Data from U.S. Department of Labor shows that software is one of the fastest-growing industries when it comes to job creation. Jobs in computer and information technology as a whole are expected to grow 11% from 2019 through 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. Specifically in the software space, jobs are expected to grow by 22% through 2029, must faster than the average. To quote Marc Andreessen, software is eating the world.

Software companies create and build different programs that assist companies and individuals to solve key problems. Software companies are offering products and services in almost all walks of human life, including finance, entertainment, education, shopping, sports, military and healthcare. The coronavirus crisis fueled growth in the industry as companies scrambled to move their operations online: schools needed education software; retailers looked for ways to increase their online sales; banks started creating secure and user-friendly apps to allow customers perform their transactions by staying at home; and governments increased their IT spending to get rid of age-old ways of doing business.

IT jobs pay higher than most of the jobs in other industries. IT companies are also giving a boost to overall productivity. These factors are pushing GDP growth in the U.S. A report by the BSA Foundation shows that the software industry accounted for $1.6 trillion of the total $20.5 trillion U.S. GDP in 2018.

Story continues 15 Fastest-Growing Software Companies

The growth of software companies could be gauged from the fact that The Big Five — Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) — had a combined valuation of $3.3 trillion, and accounted for about 40% of the value of the Nasdaq 100, as of 2017. Other than these giants, software companies like Salesforce, Shopify, Palantir, ServiceNow, PayPal, Square and Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO) are posting explosive growth numbers as well. The core reason for this growth and dominance is the fact that these companies are solving key problems and offering solutions that are full of value. In the words of legendary investor Peter Thiel, they have become monopolies by virtue of the value and satisfaction they give to their customers. Software companies also grow fast because they have low marginal costs and big potential to scale.

We have since been impressed with the company’s ability to navigate the tough macro environment, and oil prices have improved. We believe it has been able to deliver very attractive growth despite the macro uncertainty, giving us more confidence to start a position during the quarter. We think the company has an outstanding competitive position, a highly recurring business model, robust margins and returns, and a management team that exhibits all the behaviors that we seek, especially value-creating reinvestment.”

Computer hardware industry experienced a massive growth over the course of a century. In 1946, the first computer, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built in the U.S. It weighed more than 27 tons and had over 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays. Today, massive computing power has been narrowed down to chips the size of pins.

In the last few years, the tech hardware sector has faced major shifts in areas such as graphics processing and virtual reality. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as the next major trend in the computer market with the potential to establish an impact across the business spectrum. IoT and AI will fuel the demand for hardware companies. Data from McKinsey shows that by 2025, AI-related semiconductors could account for about 20% of the total hardware demand. This translates into $67 billion in revenue.  5 Biggest Tech Hardware Companies in the World

Computer hardware industry experienced a massive growth over the course of a century. In 1946, the first computer, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built in the U.S. It weighed more than 27 tons and had over 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays. Today, massive computing power has been narrowed down to chips the size of pins.

In the last few years, the tech hardware sector has faced major shifts in areas such as graphics processing and virtual reality. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as the next major trend in the computer market with the potential to establish an impact across the business spectrum. IoT and AI will fuel the demand for hardware companies. Data from McKinsey shows that by 2025, AI-related semiconductors could account for about 20% of the total hardware demand. This translates into $67 billion in revenue.  5 Biggest Tech Hardware Companies in the World

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: Cybersecurity firm Tenable announcing it is acquiring Paris-based startup Alsid for $98 million today. The firm saying the acquisition will help customers find and fix security weaknesses in Microsoft's Active Directory in real-time. Let's bring in Amit Yoran. He is the CEO of Tenable. Amit, it's good to talk to you today. Walk me through this acquisition. How has something like the SolarWinds hack that we have seen play out more recently strengthened the case to really beef up some of your security assets?

AMIT YORAN: Well, I think SolarWinds is a great example of the types of cybersecurity challenges that are facing corporate America today in organizations around the world. So there are so many ways to enter a network, so many vulnerable systems out there and ways to compromise and gain access. And so organizations really need to be agile-- identify where they have exposures, tighten those up, and be able to respond to incidents as they unfold.

ZACK GUZMAN: And when we talk about the opportunity here, obviously, cybersecurity names had seen quite the pop in 2020, whether you look at a CrowdStrike or a Zscaler or Okta. When you're looking to kind of address these issues, what is Tenable doing different to maybe focus in on the enterprise opportunity here with an acquisition like this?

AMIT YORAN: Well, Tenable is foundationally about answering this question, how secure am I? How at risk am I? And how can I most efficiently reduce risk? So we help customers do that in their enterprise environments. We help them do it in the cloud. With the acquisition of Alsid, we have the ability to-- or the technology has the ability to look at directory services.

So all of the accounts across your enterprises, directory services store all of those accounts and all the passwords. And Alsid evaluates how securely or how weakly that active directory has been configured. In many cases, in many instances, there's lots of vulnerabilities there. And the configuration needs to be tightened down.

Story continues

As part of the attack lifecycle, when an adversary gains access to systems, they will attempt to raise their privilege level to be able to move laterally across the environment to gain access to the information they want. And they will create new accounts to establish persistence, so that if you shut them down, they'll have these back doors to get back into your environment. So we think active directory plays an absolutely critical role in corporate cybersecurity and is part of Tenable's overall strategy to help assess and understand and address cyber risk.

AKIKO FUJITA: No question the concerns around cybersecurity have been heightened as so many of these companies have merely migrated a lot of their operations online. We've talked a lot about the digital acceleration. We had a guest on from Microsoft earlier, who was talking about being able to connect everything in the cloud in terms of the work environment. From your vantage point, how have the threats evolved as a result of this acceleration into the cloud that we've seen over the last year?

AMIT YORAN: Well, there's-- great question. And there's two things that have happened in the last year that have a profound impact on cybersecurity. One is this migration to work from home. All of the employees which were coming into an office and accessing networks and information from offices are now working from home. In that work from home world, you have fewer control points. You have less control of the environment. And one of those few and critical control points is the user's account, the account itself, their identity.

The same is true as you migrate to cloud-based infrastructures. Again, you don't have the same type of control of the overall environment. One of those few remaining control points is the actual and are the actual accounts. So again, we feel like active directory and tightly configuring and securing your active directory is an absolutely critical component to cloud security and security in a work from home environment. And again, it's one of the key reasons why this acquisition with Alsid makes tremendous sense for us.

ZACK GUZMAN: It would also, I suppose, maybe hinge on, you know, a want and a need for companies to really be investing on making sure they're checking the boxes to secure their operations here. We've been talking a lot about maybe more companies moving in the direction of Tesla to put Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet. I imagine that that makes it even more important to make sure security stop gaps are filled in here.

Talk to me about maybe some of the catalysts here because SolarWinds is obviously one. But each time we hear about these hacks, and increasingly, maybe even the nation state actors here, how has that maybe led to the overall sector as a whole growing, and how do you see that changing, moving forward?

AMIT YORAN: Well, I think all of these hacks highlight-- and SolarWinds is just the latest of a long litany of examples that we hear about almost every week in, week out. The examples continue.

What we're seeing-- and I think the most profound trend occurring in cybersecurity-- is the engagement of senior executives in understanding the board of directors. The CEO the audit and risk committee have an incredibly important role to play to assess the cybersecurity of the enterprise and ensure that you're adequately measuring and protecting against that cyber risk. We're seeing it a a corporate level. And I think that's leading to an increased level of spend and growth for the cybersecurity market.

And we're also now seeing it a a national level. We saw it with President Biden's recent attachment of cybersecurity dollars to cyber relief budget. We saw it in his initial engagements with Putin. The Cybersecurity issue has come up. So it is achieving a level of awareness and attention at senior levels of corporate and national security communities.

ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and nobody wants to be caught dealing with that situation, too, in those executive level positions. But Amit Yoran, Tenable CEO, appreciate you coming on here to chat all of that.

103,2021-02-10T11:00:19+00:00,Microsoft CEO's Take on Tech's Clout: `Big by Itself Is Not Bad’,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said social-media services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube need clearer laws and rules to govern whether controversial accounts, like former U.S. President Donald Trump’s, have a place on their services, rather than being asked to make free-speech decisions themselves.

“Unilateral action by individual companies in democracies like ours is just not long-term stable—we do need to be able to have a framework of laws and norms,” Nadella said in a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “Depending on any one individual CEO in any one of these companies to make calls that are going to really help us maintain something as sacred and as important as our democracy in the long run is just no way that at least I, as a citizen, would advocate for.”

Microsoft doesn’t currently run a consumer social media service, but it is among cloud-computing providers that have been pulled into the debate over the deplatforming of certain individual voices, social-media accounts and entire apps, especially following the violent pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its hosting services from Parler LLC, a social network that touts itself as anti-censorship and was popular among conservative and extremist figures. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google previously had removed Parler from their app stores. The three tech companies’ actions essentially took the service offline. Trump’s account, meantime, was banned from Twitter Inc. and remains suspended on Facebook Inc.

In the past several years, antitrust regulators have ramped up investigations into the market power of large technology companies, just as Microsoft fell under government scrutiny and faced a U.S. antitrust lawsuit more than two decades ago, when Nadella was a rising manager. It’s better for the younger technology companies to face robust competition and handle negative consequences of growing too big ahead of time, rather than waiting until their size leads to problems for consumers and rivals, the CEO said.

Story continues

“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”

The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said.

“There is no God-given right for U.S. tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said. “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.

Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”

Microsoft doesn’t currently run a consumer social media service, but it is among cloud-computing providers that have been pulled into the debate over the deplatforming of certain individual voices, social-media accounts and entire apps, especially following the violent pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol last month. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit pulled its hosting services from Parler LLC, a social network that touts itself as anti-censorship and was popular among conservative and extremist figures. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google previously had removed Parler from their app stores. The three tech companies’ actions essentially took the service offline. Trump’s account, meantime, was banned from Twitter Inc. and remains suspended on Facebook Inc.

In the past several years, antitrust regulators have ramped up investigations into the market power of large technology companies, just as Microsoft fell under government scrutiny and faced a U.S. antitrust lawsuit more than two decades ago, when Nadella was a rising manager. It’s better for the younger technology companies to face robust competition and handle negative consequences of growing too big ahead of time, rather than waiting until their size leads to problems for consumers and rivals, the CEO said.

Story continues

“Big by itself is not bad, but competition is good,” he said. “And more importantly, you need to have a business model that really is aligned with the world doing well. There are certain categories of products where the unintended consequences of the growth on that category or lack of competition creates issues.”

The need for competition includes rivalry from China, Nadella said, although national security concerns must be reckoned with by each government, Nadella said.

“There is no God-given right for U.S. tech companies to take for granted that there cannot be other tech powers,” he said. “All of us in the West Coast of the United States need to be more grounded, because sometimes I think we celebrate our own advances far too much.” Instead, companies should look at what's happening in the world and how relevant their technology is, he said.

Microsoft shares have surged more than 500% since Nadella took over as CEO seven years ago, after languishing for more than a decade under his predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Though Microsoft has mostly eluded the regulatory scrutiny of other tech giants more recently, it has drawn some complaints from smaller rivals. In July, Slack Technologies Inc., which is being acquired by Salesforce.com Inc., urged European Union antitrust regulators to probe Microsoft for unfairly foisting its Teams collaborative software on millions of users by combining it with Office 365 cloud-based productivity programs. Nadella dismissed those claims. “I always ask the question, would Slack have even existed if it was not for the free access they had on top of, say, the Windows platform?” he said. “They didn’t have to call Microsoft. They didn't have to go through any of our app stores. They didn't need any of our permission compared to any of the other platforms that they're available on. We perhaps provide the most open platform in Windows and even in Office 365.”

Chicago, IL – February 9, 2021 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of FedEx Corporation FDX as the Bull of the Day, Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

FedEx is a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) that is a leader in global express delivery services. The company proves a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services that delivers to more than 220 countries and territories.

The stock really got going late last year, more than tripling from its March lows to the end of 2021. The recent pullback provides investors with a technical entry point after the stock saw support at a Fibonacci retracement level. Additionally, after UPS earnings last week, the fundamentals in the industry look strong, making an argument for FDX to grind higher into earnings on March 18th.

About the Company

FedEx was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The company employs 245,000 employees, has 30,000 service vehicles and has 98,000 drop off locations.

FDX has a market cap of about $67 Billion and has Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Growth and “B” in Value. The Forward PE is just 15, which makes the case for valuation in relative terms.

The company is currently reporting, primarily through the FedEx Express (including TNT Express acquired in 2016), FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments. These segments contributed 51.3%, 32.8% and 10.3% respectively to the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2020.

FedEx also pays a dividend of 1.02%.

Q2 Earnings

FDX reported in late December, seeing an EPS surprise beat to the upside of 23%. The company also beat on revenue and affirmed FY21 capex. It was the third straight EPS beat for FedEx after a string of messy quarters in the previous years.

Story continues

The company said that operating results increased due to volume growth in the FedEx International Priority and U.S. domestic residential package services as well as pricing initiatives across all transportation segments. Those positive factors were offset by increased costs due to expanded services and COVID-19 related costs, but Non-GAAP op margins came in at 7.4% vs the 3.9% last year.

The company expects earnings growth in the second half of the year, but investors took the opportunity to sell into the good news after the monster stock run.

Estimates

Over the last 60 days, estimates have shot higher. For the current quarter, we have seen estimates raised by 17%, from $2.74 to $3.25. For the current year, we have seen a 12% move higher in that same time frame.

The trend higher is bullish and that idea has been reinforced by recent earnings from the company’s biggest competitor.

UPS Earnings

Last week, UPS reported an EPS beat on the top line and a 26% surprise to the upside. The company saw double digit year over year growth in domestic and international revenues. For the upcoming year, the company expects higher margins and a hike to its dividend.

The numbers signal that FedEx will enjoy similar success when it announces earnings in March. With the recent move higher in FDX this past week, it looks like investors are already jumping in.

The Technicals

The stock moved below $100 in March, but rose throughout the rest of the year, making a high of $305.66 in December. Since then, the company reported earnings and profit takers have come in, taking the stock below $240.

That area marked the halfway back, or 50% Fibonacci retracement level form the August breakout point to the $305 highs. The stock has now bounced and is above the 21-day moving average at $249. If it can take back the 50-day, currently at $266, the bulls will have fresh powder higher into the EPS report in March.

Bottom Line

The run last year happened only after the realization that the company would thrive during the pandemic. The recent sell off was due to profit taking and the question of if the success can continue. The UPS earnings gives us a clear signal that FDX will continue to thrive in the current environment.

Expect the stock to grind higher into earnings, much like it did during the August and September months. If the company can prove itself once again, all-time highs should come before the end of the quarter.

Bear of the Day:

Harley-Davidson is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a popular motorcycle manufacturer. The company operates in two segments, Motorcycles and Related Products and Financial Services. The motorcycle segment represents 80% of their revenues and is the primary driver of earnings growth.

Unfortunately for investors, there wasn’t much growth this past quarter. The company disappointed on EPS and the stock was crushed. As we approach the summer driving season, investors are left with hope that the motorcycle consumer will come back strong with their stimulus checks. However, there might be more of a fundamental issue at hand.

More about HOG

Harley-Davidson is an iconic American brand that was founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The company is valued around $5 billion and has a PE of 14. HOG has Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value but “D” in Growth. Harley pays a small dividend of 0.24%.

There is no questioning Harley's influence in Americana over the years, but that doesn’t help its stock price today. Earnings last week forced the stock over 20% lower the day they reported.

Q4 Earnings

Before this quarter, Harley has missed on EPS only twice since 2019. The surprise miss last week wasn’t necessarily surprising, but the magnitude was, with a 730% EPS miss. The company lost 44 cents instead of the expected +.10 and revenues came in below expectations as well. Both U.S. and international sales were down year after year and the operating margin hurt, coming in at -37% vs the -5.3% last year.

While the numbers may seem like a disaster, the company unveiled “The Hardwire” a five-year strategic plan that will target profitable growth and brand desirability. In this plan the company will target low double-digit EPS growth through 2025 by broadening the view of its customer, investing in core segments and strengthening its commitment to electric motorcycles.

Management obviously has identified the issues and had comments going forward:

“The entire Harley-Davidson team put forth tremendous effort in 2020 and we now have the right organization, structure and strategy in place to make step changes in our performance and enhance our position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world.”

While there is a plan, analysts and investors might not be on board yet. The company will have to prove itself in upcoming quarters as for now, estimates are falling.

Estimates

The quarter forced estimates lower over all time frames. The last 7 days have seen next quarters estimates fall from $1.20 to $0.90, or 20%. For the current year, estimates dropped from $2.76 to $2.34, or 15%.

The drop in estimates led to price cuts from Wedbush ($42 from $45) and BMO ($40 from $46).

A Fundamental Issue

The motorcycle industry has gone through hard years as late, with sluggish sales being blamed on more risk-averse millennials. There simply aren’t enough new riders to replace the older riders that supported the industry for so long. Motorcycles simply aren’t as cool as they used to be. For those with the disposable income that might have taken up the idea thirty years ago, they are not riding or buying into the brand.

But perhaps the end of COVID might change everything. The idea of getting out on the road after being stuck in your house for a year might sound great for some new customers. Harley and other motorcycle companies need to market and sell that idea if they want to change the trend away from bikes.

The Technicals

The chart looked great before earnings, but the down move broke some key levels. The $30 area is the 200-day Moving average and investors that think the company can turn things around should eyeball that level. Back over $40 would indicate the bulls know something the bears don’t, so let’s assume if the stock can get back there, The Hardwire plan is working

In Summary

It's going to take a while for the company to prove itself, so for now investors should consider this stock dead money. It is hard not to root for a brand like Harley, as the iconic American image has so much value in itself. Everyone loves a turnaround story, but be patient with this one and let the chart speak for itself.

Stocks to Watch as Adoption of A.I. Looks Poised to Grow

Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) has become an integral part of the technology revolution that we have been witnessing over the years on an accelerated shift toward automation to increase efficiency or handle complex data sets and calculations. The COVID-19 pandemic last year gave a push to digital transformation as the world shifted to a remote working model to curb the spread of the virus, in turn, boosting the need for AI. Notably, per a report by SG Analytics, the global market size of AI is estimated to witness a CAGR of 42.2% between 2020 and 2027.

The report mentioned that certain trends will be important to look forward to in 2021. This includes trends like robotic process automation, which allows monotonous tasks to be carried out efficiently in large volumes by AI.

Other trends like natural language processing, which teaches computers to understand what is being written or spoken about a process, with the help of a machine learning model, is also becoming important. Notably, this particular trend is rapidly decreasing the need for users to type on a device’s screen, thereby increasing convenience.

Meanwhile, the digital transformation has also led to an increased need for cybersecurity in order to better protect important data and information. The report mentioned that AI will assist security departments in organizing a “digital shield to protect data from malicious attacks.” Separately, the Internet of Things is another area where AI is set to gain prominence as it helps to monitor ""the performance of various interconnected gadgets.”

In fact, per a report by the International Data Corporation (“IDC”), global spending on artificial intelligence is estimated to reach $110 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.1% from 2019 to 2024. Notably, the report mentioned that the main drivers behind the adoption of AI will be delivering a better customer experience and helping employees improve at their jobs.

Moreover, the report mentioned that retail and banking are set to spend the most on AI solutions during the forecast period. While the retail industry will focus on improving customer experience through chatbots and recommendation engines, the banking sector will focus on fraud analysis and investigation, among others. Notably, IDC stated that the United States is set to deliver more than half of all the spending on AI during the forecast period.

3 Stocks to Keep an Eye On

AI looks set to continue disrupting the technology sector and in turn, influence the ways in which businesses and users function as it is becoming increasingly present in varied activities that we engage in. From automation to delivering personalized recommendations and chatbots, leading to higher customer satisfaction, AI is becoming indispensable.

Hence, this makes it a good time to watch out for companies focused on AI that can make the most of this continued upswing. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Microsoft develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide. Notably, businesses can use the company’s Azure AI platform for the development of AI solutions. Moreover, in 2019, the company invested $1 billion in San Francisco-based research lab OpenAI, for the development of artificial general intelligence.

The company also has its own virtual assistant named Cortana. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 8.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current- year is 27.4%.

Micron Technology designs, manufactures, and sells memory and storage products worldwide. Notably, the company’s products like high-capacity memory and multichip power packages are used to power AI training and inference engines whether in cloud, or embedded in mobile and edge devices. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 11.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 36.4%.

Amazon engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. Notably, the company has its own AI voice assistant Alexa which brings customers increased convenience. Moreover, the company also has its Amazon Web Services platform which offers tools for businesses in order to create machine learning solutions.

Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 8.4% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.1%.

Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation

Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.

A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks’ just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is only available for a limited time.

109,2021-02-08T01:31:36+00:00,Chip Shortage Spirals Beyond Cars to Phones and Consoles,"(Bloomberg) -- The first hints of trouble emerged in the spring of 2020. The world was in the early throes of a mysterious pandemic, which first obliterated demand then super-charged internet and mobile computing when economies regained their footing. That about-face -- in a span of months -- laid the seeds for potentially the most serious shortage in years of the semiconductors that lie at the heart of everything from smartphones to cars and TVs.

Auto and electronics makers that cut back drastically in the early days of the outbreak are now rushing to re-up orders, only to get turned away because chipmakers are stretched to the max supplying smartphone giants like Apple Inc. This week, Qualcomm Inc.’s Cristiano Amon, head of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker, flagged shortages “across the board,” citing the industry’s reliance on just a handful of players in Asia.

Amon joined a growing chorus of industry leaders warning in recent weeks they can’t get enough chips to make their products. Carmakers appear in direst straits and have spurred the U.S. and German governments to come to their aid -- General Motors Co. this month was forced to mothball three North American plants and Ford Motor Co. is bracing for a 20% drop in near-term output. But more industries have lately copped to shortages, emphasizing how Covid-19 and a boom in a new breed of 5G-ready smartphones like the iPhone 12 is exacerbating a shortage of capacity plaguing the entire consumer industry. Chip shortages are expected to wipe out $61 billion of sales for automakers alone, but the hit to the much larger electronics industry -- while tough to quantify at this early stage -- could be far larger.

Apple, a major Qualcomm customer, said recently that sales of some new high-end iPhones were hemmed in by a shortage of components. Europe’s NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG -- whose roles near the top of the supply chain grant them visibility over global chip flows -- have both indicated the constraints are no longer confined to autos. And Sony Corp. said Wednesday it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks.

Story continues

“The virus pandemic, social distancing in factories, and soaring competition from tablets, laptops and electric cars are causing some of the toughest conditions for smartphone component supply in many years,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst with Strategy Analytics. He estimates prices for key smartphone components including chipsets and displays have risen as much as 15% in the past three to six months.

PC makers were among the first to hint, in the spring of 2020, at an impending crunch, a warning echoed by Lenovo Group Ltd. on Wednesday. At the heart of the crisis sits Taiwan and its largest company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the chipmaker of choice to the world’s technology and auto giants. It spent billions in past years ensuring it remains at the forefront of semiconductor production technology -- a costly exercise that’s both paid off and also thrust it into the middle of a global geopolitical dogfight.

On Friday, Qualcomm and Corning Inc. joined Biden administration officials to discuss the gathering storm with their Taiwanese counterparts and the island’s top industry representatives including TSMC. Both sides repeatedly stressed their interdependence, Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-Hua told reporters. The presence of several senior U.S. officials and the Semiconductor Industry Association -- which represents America’s biggest chipmakers -- emphasized the urgency of the situation.

The current crisis stems from several factors that converged last year. Like most every chip designer on the planet, Qualcomm outsources production to Asian companies, foremost among which are TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. The pair are increasingly the only recourse for producing the most advanced semiconductors. But their capacity takes years to plan and billions of dollars to build in tandem with customers, and the post-Covid 5G phone and internet boom took their clients by surprise.

Industry executives also blame excessive stockpiling, which began over the summer when Huawei Technologies Co. -- a major smartphone and networking gear maker -- began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei, Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020 -- making up almost a fifth of the country’s overall imports for the year.

Rivals including Apple, worried about their own caches, responded in kind. At the same time, the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers, all of which now come with smart, customized chips. TSMC executives said on its two most recent earnings calls that customers have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against uncertainties, a maneuver they see persisting for some time.

“There’s a chip stockpiling arms race,” said Will Bright, co-founder and chief product officer at Drop, which uses custom chips in headphones and keyboards.

All that has dried up the spigot for smaller-volume buyers such as the makers of cars and gaming consoles: Nintendo Co., Sony and Microsoft Corp. have struggled to make enough Switches, PlayStations and Xboxes for about a year. The game hardware industry is bracing for supply to get worse before it gets better in 2021, potentially even affecting the next holiday season, people familiar with the matter say.

It didn’t help that automakers -- the most visible cohort to be affected -- misjudged the situation. Some industry observers blame their predicament on near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in auto demand. Others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.

On Friday, Minebea Mitsumi Inc. -- a vital supplier to the transport and electronics industries -- suggested shortages may plague even more sectors, including aviation. “Demand is springing up everywhere at a faster-than-expected pace,” CEO Yoshihisa Kainuma told analysts on a call. “Airlines around the world are scrapping old aircraft to slim down their balance sheet. And people’s desire to travel will explode after the pandemic.”

It’s anybody’s guess when production will catch up with demand. But a growing number of industry observers don’t see quick or simple resolution.

“A lot of it can be traced back to the second quarter of last year, when the whole world basically shut down. Many auto companies shut down manufacturing and their suppliers re-prioritized,” said Mario Morales, an analyst with IDC. “Not until the second half will we see relief for some of these markets.”

110,2021-02-07T12:41:47+00:00,20 Fastest Growing Tech Cities in the World,"In this article we are going to list the 20 fastest growing tech cities in the world. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 fastest growing tech cities in the world. According to the World Health Organization, two-thirds of the world’s population will be residing in urban cities in about 35 years. This would lead to an additional increase in the population residing in the urban cities. The demand of such an increase can only be met with the aid of cutting-edge technology. Technology will not only help with food production but also provide employment opportunities to people and a source of income. These tech cities further bring venture capital investment into the country and as a result, lead to economic prosperity and increase in standards of living.

Tech cities provide a huge benefit to their local and national economies. They help in attracting investment and skilled human resource from all over the world. Although tech cities do bring a bundle of advantages, they may also create challenges for the economies. In case of an increase in demand, the working spaces may become expensive for startups operating at a smaller scale with limited access to funds. Also, a threat of insularity may develop over time which may lead to lesser chances of external collaboration.

Government policies play a major role in the creation of tech cities. It is impossible that a city prospers in the global tech race without the intervention of its government. David Cameroon, ex-prime Minister of the UK, wanted London to be the next Silicon Valley. For this purpose, “Tech Nation” was launched by the government since their ultimate strategy was to boost technological capabilities within the UK. Similar was the ambition of the Dutch government in the Netherlands where the government focused on making favorable trade deals that would increase the technological potential of the cities like Eindhoven, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. For example, Startup Amsterdam was initiated by the Dutch Government to increase the collaboration between the city and the private companies. Through this initiative startup could seek help and expand within the same environment, thus helping the Netherlands economy grow and become one of the tech countries that promotes innovation and collaboration.

Huge tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are based in USA because of tech-friendly initiatives and policies by the government. On the other hand, the French government, under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged to make Paris the capital among all the tech nations, giving stiff competition to other European countries like Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. Paris has been home to the multi-million-pound startup, Station F, which serves as the biggest startup campus. There has been a large influx of startups moving to Paris and working at Station F. Not just small-scaled startups are using Station F’s resources and services, but also partners like Vente-Privée, HEC (NASDAQ:HEC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), L'Oréal and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN).

Berlin, arguably the world’s coolest city, is not far behind in technology and innovation. The organizational culture thrives on focusing on innovation. It is also home to one of the most successful startups, Delivery Hero, operating in more than 40+ companies and a parent company to Foodpanda, which rivals Uber Eats in certain countries. The German government introduced the Digital Hub Initiative to encourage collaboration between various startups in the digital era. The rankings and listings of the fastest-growing tech cities in the world have been compiled from London and Partners, Forbes, and Savills. So without further ado, let's take a look at the cities which are going to be the future tech capitals of the world, starting with number 20:

20. Eindhoven

Eindhoven is the hub of technology and innovation in Netherlands. This city is home to companies such as ASML, Phillips and VDL.

Although the city is not widely thought of as a travel destination, it is popular among fintech companies or startups that wish to expand.

Moreover, the Lithuanian government has introduced what is known as a “start-up visa” to encourage tech businesses and top talent from all over the world to settle in Vilnius.

18. Tallinn

What is fascinating about the tech capital of Estonia, Tallinn, is that with an e-Residency permit, an individual can start their business in Estonia, without actually living there. This is because around 99% of the public services are available online, which makes it incredibly easy for tech companies to establish there, something the other countries are still struggling with. In addition, the government has also introduced a digital nomad visa, which will allow individuals working remotely to live and work in Estonia for up to one year. This provides a supportive environment for tech businesses or startups.

17. Cape Town

Cape Town is not only home to a scenic landscape but also to the largest financial institutions of the country. Startups are now taking advantage of the wide availability of the financial services in the city to expand their operations and services. As per the data by Invest Cape Town, around 60% of the South African startups are situated in Cape Town. However, venture capital investment is on the rise as well, in particular, it grew by 147% from 2016-2019. Thus, making Cape Town a popular choice among the tech companies.

Companies like Lenovo, Samsung and Apple have set up research and development centers in the city, owing to its wide specialty in the field of R&D. Hence more and more tech companies prefer to establish their businesses in the city.

Currently, Shanghai’s ‘Silicon Valley’ has more than 1000,000 workers employed within the companies.

8. New York City

Before 2010, New York was quite far behind Silicon Valley and Boston in technology and innovation. Now it is catching up and it is catching up fast.

During 2013, there were around 7000 high tech companies operating in the city, as per the state’s office. The city also provided a free Wi-Fi facility, known as LinkNYC, which was made available to the public including small scale businesses. Worst Neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn in 2018

111,2021-02-07T12:41:47+00:00,20 Fastest Growing Tech Cities in the World,"In this article we are going to list the 20 fastest growing tech cities in the world. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 fastest growing tech cities in the world. According to the World Health Organization, two-thirds of the world’s population will be residing in urban cities in about 35 years. This would lead to an additional increase in the population residing in the urban cities. The demand of such an increase can only be met with the aid of cutting-edge technology. Technology will not only help with food production but also provide employment opportunities to people and a source of income. These tech cities further bring venture capital investment into the country and as a result, lead to economic prosperity and increase in standards of living.

Tech cities provide a huge benefit to their local and national economies. They help in attracting investment and skilled human resource from all over the world. Although tech cities do bring a bundle of advantages, they may also create challenges for the economies. In case of an increase in demand, the working spaces may become expensive for startups operating at a smaller scale with limited access to funds. Also, a threat of insularity may develop over time which may lead to lesser chances of external collaboration.

Government policies play a major role in the creation of tech cities. It is impossible that a city prospers in the global tech race without the intervention of its government. David Cameroon, ex-prime Minister of the UK, wanted London to be the next Silicon Valley. For this purpose, “Tech Nation” was launched by the government since their ultimate strategy was to boost technological capabilities within the UK. Similar was the ambition of the Dutch government in the Netherlands where the government focused on making favorable trade deals that would increase the technological potential of the cities like Eindhoven, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. For example, Startup Amsterdam was initiated by the Dutch Government to increase the collaboration between the city and the private companies. Through this initiative startup could seek help and expand within the same environment, thus helping the Netherlands economy grow and become one of the tech countries that promotes innovation and collaboration.

AAPL, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV and Intel Corporation INTC.

Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:

Top 5 Dow Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio in a Capricious Market

Wall Street witnessed a spike in volatile trading last week primarily owing to a typical trading practice in which a few key heavily shorted stocks by hedge fund giants were favored by a group of individual investors organized via Reddit’s wallstreet bets forum. Moreover, a slower-than-expected rollout of COVID-19 vaccines also dented investors confidence to some extent.

A section of market participants have already raised concerns regarding a bubble in the market. All the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — suffered their worst weekly performance since October 2020 in last week.

The stock-market volatility is likely to continue in the days to come. Despite an unpredictable market, five Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are likely to provide solid returns in the near term. Investment in these stocks at this stage is likely to be prudent.

Markets May Remain Volatile in Near Future

Wall Street is expected to continue fluctuating in the near future as we are reeling under the resurgence of coronavirus and its newly found mutated strings. Nationwide vaccination is still a long way to go.

Moreover, the recent spike in prices of some highly shorted stocks fueled by the Reddit-based platform is spiraling into the metals market. On Feb 1, the prices of silver futures surged 8% to $29.06 per ounce, marking the largest single-day gain on NYMEX since Feb 15, 2013.

Story continues

Furthermore, discount online brokerage firm Robinhood said that it has mobilized $3.4 billion from retail investors since Jan 28 amid extreme market volatility. The figure exceeds the total amount that the online broker has raised since its inception in 2013.

Persistence of volatility is evident from the COBE VIX reading  — popularly known as the best fear-gauge of Wall Street. In a nutshell, the VIX indicates the market's expectation of a 30-day forward-looking volatility based on the near-term S&P 500 Index options (both puts and calls).

Notably, VIX is currently hovering in the range of 30 to 35 while it was in the range of 20 to 25 in December and January. At its current level, the fear gauge is well above its long-term reading at around 20.

At its current level of 30.24, the VIX is higher than its 50-day moving average of 23.47 and the 200-day moving average of 27.38. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trend setter while the 200-day moving average is the long-term trend setter. This clearly indicates that the market will remain volatile and stocks may swing widely in either direction in the near future.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed down our search to five Dow stocks that have strong growth potential for both short and long-term (3-5 years) and have witnessed robust earnings estimate revisions in the last 7 to 30 days. All these stocks carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Apple's Services and Wearables businesses are expected to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond.

The Goldman Sachs Group's key source of earnings stability is its business diversification.

It operates through three segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance.

The Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 10.6% for the current year. It has a long-term growth rate of 6.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 2.2% over the last 7 days.

Intel Corp.'s primary focus area is the data center and cloud, where it is doing everything possible to maintain its market share and profitability. It operates through Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, Programmable Solutions Group, Client Computing Group and All Other segments.

Although the Zacks Rank #2 company has a negative expected earnings growth rate for the current year, it has a long-term growth rate of 7.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 6.2% over the last 30 days.

Zacks Names “Single Best Pick to Double”

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it’s poised for a monster turnaround. Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Investing.com -- Sometimes a tweet is all it takes.

Kodak announced the expanded partnership in December. Its shares are up 255% in the last year. Wednesday's jump briefly led to a halt on volatility.

The Mountain View, California-based company revealed the number on Tuesday in a statement. For 2020, the cloud division lost $5.6 billion, Alphabet said.

“An important element of our operating loss is that we have been building out our organization ahead of revenue, and that includes our product portfolio, the network of data centers,” Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. This will help the company pursue this large market opportunity, she added.

Google Cloud revenue climbed 47% to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter, matching analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Brian Fitzgerald, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., was looking for Google Cloud to generate an operating margin of less than 20% in the fourth quarter, or roughly $750 million in profit on revenue of $3.75 billion.

Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak expected Google Cloud to make about $3 billion last year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

The results are way behind Amazon.com Inc., which runs Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider. That business generated fourth-quarter operating income of $3.56 billion on revenue of $12.7 billion.

Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian is trying to catch Amazon and Microsoft Corp. He has spent rapidly to expand the cloud sales force and the company has continued investing in new data centers.

Some analysts expect profitability to emerge as the division matures. Morgan Stanley’s Nowak sees Google Cloud’s EBITDA reaching $13 billion by 2024 on revenue of $35 billion.

117,2021-02-02T12:13:12+00:00,Top 5 Dow Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio in a Capricious Market,"Wall Street witnessed a spike in volatile trading last week primarily owing to a typical trading practice in which a few key heavily shorted stocks by hedge fund giants were favored by a group of individual investors organized via Reddit’s wallstreetbets forum. Moreover, a slower-than-expected rollout of COVID-19 vaccines also dented investors confidence to some extent.

A section of market participants have already raised concerns regarding a bubble in the market. All the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — suffered their worst weekly performance since October 2020 in last week.

The stock-market volatility is likely to continue in the days to come. Despite an unpredictable market, five Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are likely to provide solid returns in the near term. Investment in these stocks at this stage is likely to be prudent.

Markets May Remain Volatile in Near Future

Wall Street is expected to continue fluctuating in the near future as we are reeling under the resurgence of coronavirus and its newly found mutated strings. Nationwide vaccination is still a long way to go.

Moreover, the recent spike in prices of some highly shorted stocks fueled by the Reddit-based platform is spiraling into the metals market. On Feb 1, the prices of silver future surged 8% to $29.06 per ounce, marking the largest single-day gain on NYMEX since Feb 15, 2013.

Furthermore, discount online brokerage firm Robinhood said that it has mobilized $3.4 billion from retail investors since Jan 28 amid extreme market volatility. The figure exceeds the total amount that the online broker has raised since its inception in 2013.

Persistence of volatility is evident from the COBE VIX reading — popularly known as the best fear-gauge of Wall Street. In a nutshell, the VIX indicates market's expectation of a 30-day forward-looking volatility based on the near-term S&P 500 Index options (both puts and calls).

Story continues

Notably, VIX is currently hovering in the range of 30 to 35 while it was in the range of 20 to 25 in December and January. At its current level, the fear gauge is well above its long-term reading at around 20.

At its current level of 30.24, the VIX is higher than its 50-day moving average of 23.47 and the 200-day moving average of 27.38. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trend setter while the 200-day moving average is the long-term trend setter. This clearly indicates that the market will remain volatile and stocks may swing widely in either direction in the near future.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed down our search to five Dow stocks that have strong growth potential for both short and long-term (3-5 years) and have witnessed robust earnings estimation revisions in the last 7 to 30 days.

Zacks Names “Single Best Pick to Double”

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it’s poised for a monster turnaround. Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year.

118,2021-02-01T21:21:05+00:00,Google Shuts Down Stadia In-House Game Development,"(Bloomberg) -- Google is no longer competing with PlayStation and the Xbox, announcing Monday that it’s shutting down the division of Stadia that was dedicated to making exclusive games.

“Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Stadia vice president and general manager Phil Harrison said in a statement.

Now, rather than try to rival the video game industry’s big players, Stadia will partner with them. Harrison said the division will expand “our efforts to help game developers and publishers take advantage of our platform technology and deliver games directly to their players.” Stadia will continue to provide titles from other developers, but will no longer supplement them with its own slate of games as Google originally planned.

Stadia, which launched in November 2019, was an attempt from Alphabet Inc.’s Google to take on the video game console giants with a platform of its own. Unlike traditional consoles, Stadia allows users to play games on devices such as Android phones and Chromecast apps for TV, by funneling data directly from Google’s server clusters. The goal, Google said when it announced the service, was to reach well beyond the audience of traditional gamers and especially penetrate markets such as China and India, where many people cannot easily afford or access a pricey PlayStation from Sony Corp. or Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

Gaming news site Kotaku earlier reported the reorganization, saying that about 150 people will lose their jobs as part of the plans, which include shutting offices in Montreal and Los Angeles, although Google will try to place them elsewhere. “We’re committed to working with this talented team to find new roles and support them,” Harrison said in the statement.

Story continues

Most players found that Stadia performed well, but the pricing model led to confusion. Rather than package games in a subscription service like Netflix or Xbox Game Pass, Stadia required players to buy individual titles. At launch, users also had to pay for a $130 package to get started. By many accounts the service has underperformed as a result. One former employee said Stadia’s initial sales were well below expectations. Google’s long-term strategy had been to invest in studios to develop games that could only be played on Stadia.

As part of the restructuring, veteran executive Jade Raymond, formerly of Electronic Arts Inc. and Ubisoft Entertainment SA, is leaving Google, Harrison said in the statement.

On Jan. 22, Thornton Law Firm announced it had filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of QS investors who bought the stock between Nov. 27 and Dec. 31, 2020, citing misleading statements made by senior executives to investors regarding its solid-state battery technology.

If only that were the single, solitary legal action out there. Bernstein Liebhard LLP is also suing QuantumScape, as well as the Klein Law Firm, all the firms making essentially the same allegations over the exact same time period.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The shot across the bow that started it all? A Jan. 4 article in SeekingAlpha, where Brian Morin laid out a case in painstaking scientific detail for why making a solid-state battery “is hard — very, very hard. So hard, in fact, that nobody has done it.”

7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times

Now I did go back and forth on the company that funded QuantumScape through a reverse merger, Kensington Capital Corp. Still, Kensington’s Form 425, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of QuantumScape going public, set off my Spidey Sense.

I said so in early November:

“When I peruse an SEC filing with as many charts and hyperbolic language as this one, I immediately get suspicious. Yes, the document serves as a sales pitch of sorts to brief key investors in Kensington Capital stock. But think about that. If I brief such purse-string holders on my progress — let’s suppose I’m selling shares of Lou here — I’m not going to go deep into the pitfalls and significant challenges.”

If I was right, and all these lawyers prevail, those who own QS stock face some frightening propositions. Like: Will anything the lead plaintiffs get from a successful suit make up for what they stand to lose in the meantime? Or: If the charges turn out to be unfounded, do they still point to red flags investors can no longer ignore? Worst of all: What are the chances the company could go down in flames?

What Could Sink QS Stock

Investors will have until March 8 to join the Thortnon suit, which lobs some pretty serious charges against QuantumScape. It alleges that the company violated federal securities laws, specifically through two actions that, if true, will rattle even the staunchest supporters of QS stock.

Thornton contends first that QuantumScape executives “significantly overstated” success related to its solid-state battery power, battery life and energy density. The suit also maintains that “QuantumScape is unlikely to be able to scale its technology to the multi-layer cell necessary to power electric vehicles.”

QuantumScape has claimed its products will increase energy density by 88 percent when compared to lithium-ion batteries and deliver a fast charge of 15 minutes to reach 80% capacity. That appears consistent with what other solid-state battery projects hope to achieve. Morin himself praised the company’s science as “very good.”

But no matter how one slices, dices, spins or reads it, the class action suits are damning stuff. The contentions don’t have to be true to give QuantumScape a black eye. And, as an observer, I take no delight in that whatsoever.

The company claims Bill Gates, the Megalith of Miscrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as a high-profile backer. And if things skew in the right direction, QS stock will catch a sub-sector updraft. Solid-state battery tech is getting a heavy workout at two of Japan’s biggest automakers.

But therein also lies a 15-megawatt problem. If automakers can figure out the solid-state battery puzzle on their own, do they really need an outside company to supply the goods?

Assessing the State of Solid State

Insofar as Toyota (NYSE TM) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) are concerned, in-house solid-state will do just fine, thanks.

Both companies have the Japanese government backing them on their respective projects and Toyota could unveil a solid-state EV prototype this year if all goes well. They want this, bad: Toyota does not currently offer a battery-powered vehicle in the United States.

Sure, QuantumScape has an automotive partner, but it’s Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), the eco-deceptive company that brought the world Dieselgate and even bragged back in 2010 that its Golf TDI concept car ran on “Clean Diesel.”

As of June, the Volkswagen emissions scandal cost VW $33.3 billion in fines, penalties, financial settlements and buyback costs. That’s equivalent to three-quarters of what FordMotor Co. (NYSE:F) is worth. (Its market capitalization is $45 billion.)

For QuantumScape, it’s a very strange and questionable choice of dance partners, if you ask me. Now the German automaker is working with a battery company under a legal cloud. It all raises a hypothetical, hyperbolic question that perhaps is worth asking anyway: Is VW-QuantumScape a case of like attracts like?

Regardless, I think the good people who’ve put their money behind QS stock deserve some answers.

A Quantum Escape Before It’s Too Late

This is the part of the Lou Stock Market Show where I usually dive into the numbers and talk about analyst projections and the like. But to begin with, only one analyst firm follows the company and it calls QS stock underweight. And any rate: Does it really, really matter?

This investment isn’t any better than putting one’s money into disreputable EV maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), which hasn’t made a working anything either. In fact, it cornered an unusual sector of the EV market: Non-working cars that can coast downhill. So the vehicles didn’t work? No! Of course they did! They worked just fine at fooling the investor types who watched the film and assumed a good ol’ engine powered that there jalopy.

At least Nikola is trying to move on with its unethical founder gone. And with NKLA’s stock price wallowing in mud, there’s an argument that investors can now buy the bottom.

For QuantumScape, though, the troubles appear to be just beginning. Beware: Since Morin’s article and the lawsuits that followed, the stock hasn’t sustained any damage. That’s bound to change.

For never, loyal readers, is it wise to wager on a battery when “guilty as charged” hangs in the balance.

On the date of publication, Lou Carlozo did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

124,2021-01-29T11:00:00+00:00,Young Kenyan entrepreneur explains why he admires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,"Zagace Founder & President, Mubarak Muyika, joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss his biggest role models in business.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Who are your role models, Mabarak, in terms of tech CEOs and leaders and maybe people in other fields of endeavor. For instance, Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Do you, do you look to them?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I'd say I look to Bill Gates quite a bit from an aspect of competitiveness and from an aspect of focus, because he has this ability to look at things and look at them to a level that, until he gets what he wants. But I think what I borrow mostly, who I borrow mostly from is Warren Buffett, because I think Warren Buffett represents, he represents a mature American business person that is so neatly organized and thorough and to the point.

ANDY SERWER: Have you ever met Warren Buffett or been to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: No, but I will one day.

ANDY SERWER: And what about the rest of your career and your life, Mubarak? You're only 26 years old. What are your aspirations? What do you hope to achieve over the next decade and throughout your lifetime?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: You know, I think the most important thing is to figure out a way in which I can make enterprise software basically accessible to all. That's around the world, just not in Africa. Thanks to statistics and newly acquired information that informs insight on multiple things. So I think for the foreseeable decade that, I think, is what I really want to achieve, because what we've been able to do is make enterprise software standard, which was something that was really not possible in the past.

ANDY SERWER: And last question, Mubarak if you could ask Warren Buffett one question, what would it be?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I'd say investment, but then, yeah, I'd say investments.

ANDY SERWER: You'd ask him about investment?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Right. Not actually investment, but actually, ask him to invest with me.

125,2021-01-29T11:00:00+00:00,Suspected Russian Hackers Gained Edge Through Tech Firm Attacks,"(Bloomberg) -- Whether it was opportunity, strategy or sheer chutzpah, the suspected Russian hackers behind a massive cyber-attack revealed last month focused particular attention on technology companies, including cybersecurity firms entrusted to find malicious activity in their clients’ networks.

Four cybersecurity companies announced this week that they had been targeted as part of the attack, adding to a list of at least eight other tech companies that the hackers tried to breach. Many of the companies said they successfully blocked the attackers, but some others acknowledged that their networks were infiltrated.

The hackers may have focused on technology and cybersecurity companies simply because, after government agencies, they were the next best targets. For hackers, cybersecurity companies represent the gatekeepers guarding the computer networks they so desperately wish to exploit, said Allan Liska, senior security architect at cybersecurity analytics firm Recorded Future Inc.

Also, cybersecurity and technology companies often have remote access to customers’ computer networks, potentially giving hackers entry to their clients and partners. Such digital supply chain hacks are an efficient method to corral hundreds, if not thousands, of potential victims, Liska said.

“If you can compromise security infrastructure, you essentially have the keys to the kingdom and can run around undetected,” he said. “And we’re dealing with an advanced adversary who’s looking for this kind of access.”

In the case of SolarWinds Corp., for instance, the hackers installed malware in its Orion software, which is used by government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The Texas-based firm said that as many as 18,000 customers may have received the malicious code in software updates, though far fewer are believed to have been subject to further attacks from the hackers.

In addition, the hackers targeted at least one reseller of Microsoft Corp.’s Office 365 tools, likely by digging up login credentials and then compromising the resellers’ clients, cybersecurity experts say. The suspected Russian attackers used those tactics to target the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike, which wasn’t ultimately breached.

Story continues

The cyber-research firm Malwarebytes Inc. was also targeted after a third-party application that protects its Office 365 email was hacked, and the hackers gained access to a “limited subset of internal company emails,” Malwarebytes said.

There’s not yet any evidence that cybersecurity companies were a launching point for a broader attack, only that the Russian adversary attempted to do so.

”This is a persistent, sophisticated attack that requires organizations to look carefully at the supply chain of their IT infrastructure, which cybersecurity is a part of,” said Ryan Gillis, vice president for cybersecurity strategy and global policy at Palo Alto Networks Inc. “When you look at the consequences, from that we’ve seen so far, everything points back to the IT supply chain.”

Hacking into cybersecurity companies also provides attackers with advantages when launching further attacks, potentially providing them with detection tools or source code that they can use to avoid being caught, according to cybersecurity experts.

“If I am trying to break into your house, the best way to go through is to disable cameras, electronic clocks; this will give me a tactical advantage,” said Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer at Hold Security. “Knowing how to evade detection in cyber is almost the entire battle. If they have the detection tools in their pocket, they’ve taken our safeguards to use against us.”

Mimecast Ltd., an email security provider, said Tuesday that hackers had turned one of its security tools against it to view its customers’ Microsoft 365 accounts. Fidelis Cybersecurity Inc. said that the company is investigating evidence that it might have been targeted. Another cybersecurity company, Qualys Inc. was also targeted but said in a statement that “there was no impact on our production environment nor exfiltrated data.”

Palo Alto Networks said it was targeted by the same hackers in October but successfully stopped the attacks.

The hack was disclosed in December by the cybersecurity company FireEye Inc., which itself was attacked. About 10 U.S. government agencies were infiltrated as part of the attack, including the departments of Justice, Treasury and Homeland Security. Among the other technology companies that were targeted for further attacks were Microsoft and Cisco Systems Inc. U.S. officials have said they believe hackers associated with the Russian government are behind the attack.

The attack isn’t the first time that cybersecurity firms were compromised by hackers. In 2011, for instance, EMC Corp.’s RSA unit was breached, and two years later, the security firm Bit9 revealed that it had been hacked. Juniper Networks Inc. said it too was compromised in 2015.

Even so, trying to target cybersecurity companies comes with its own perils. After all, the alleged Russian hackers could still be roaming undetected through U.S. government networks, and those of various companies, if they hadn’t decided to break into FireEye’s computers.

“Attackers are getting more sophisticated, and pursuing persistence over time instead of smash and grab techniques,” said Jim Jaeger, a former U.S. Air Force brigadier general who is now president and chief cyber strategist at the cyber investigations firm Arete Advisors LLC. “Now they’re aspiring to use cybersecurity tools to get inside our networks. They’re taking our safeguards and using them against us.”

There was a long time when entrepreneurship wasn't really considered to be a very viable option for the vast majority of people in the world. Only the upper class people could consider going into business on their own, while the middle class and the lower class would work 9 to 5 jobs, and then go home to their families. However, nowadays, more and more people are fed up of the normal office job life and it's easy to see why. At least when you're in public service such as a police officer or a doctor, you are actually making a difference and helping to improve the world and improve the lives of people as well. But when you're simply in a normal job for the corporation, all you're doing is taking home a meagre salary and actually helping the corporation make all the money, which is why many people are much more interested in starting their business.

When you start your own business, you need investment from people. Even this part is becoming much easier thanks to funding websites which allow you to ask for investment by people into your product, as well as the improvement in globalization. And of course, when you start your own business, then you want it to grow and grow and become huge, earning you a windfall as your company becomes world famous. However, there is a certain threshold after which the company cannot continue to grow, not because it has reached its peak, but because it is gaining too much power and influence and disrupting the flow of a free economy.

Of course, I'm talking about the creation of a monopoly. So what exactly is a monopoly? A monopoly comes into being when only one seller or an enterprise is engaged in the business of any specific commodity. Why is this an issue, you may be asking? After all, if there's just one major company, then doesn't that mean that company has achieved economies of scale and can actually sell the product to you cheaper and can end up being entirely beneficial to everyone involved? Well, not exactly. You see, in a monopoly, there is no competition whatsoever, and it is competition which drives everyone to succeed and consistently better themselves. Imagine if you were the only employee in your company who could do a certain task and there were no available substitutes at all which meant that you were irreplaceable. Would you give the same effort you'd give in a normal environment trying to succeed and compete with fellow professionals or would you just phone in your work and laze around, since the company can't harm you any way. The latter is the much more common option, and in the same way, the monopoly won't work hard and pass of all the savings to you. In fact, due to the fact that there are no other suppliers, and hence, no viable substitutes, the company can charge as much as it wants and you'd be bound to pay the amount, which is exactly why monopolies are a major issue.

This is why by law, a monopoly is defined as an entity which has significant market power, which includes the ability to charge extremely high prices and prevent the entry of competition. The company doesn't necessarily have to be extremely large, although you'll find most of the 12 most famous monopolies of all time to be so. Instead, a company may be a monopoly even if it isn't very large but is the only player in a small industry. Now, it might seem anti-capitalistic to put limits to the growth of a company, but actually this move is pro-capitalistic, ensuring everyone has a chance to enter the industry, though yes, the move has been mostly geared towards protecting the welfare of citizens and to all the naysayers, this is actually a good move! In fact, it is a great move. Imagine if there was just one pharmaceutical company making all the essential medicine in the world. You need it to survive and yet the company could charge whatever price it wanted, possibly quickly bankrupting you. Or if there was just one car company, which refused to incorporate safety features and sold a below average car for extremely high prices. Again, you'd be powerless especially if you lived in a country with little public transport infrastructure. Or even if an oil company was a monopoly, and this is a real life example which you'll learn more about further on in the greatest monopolies of all time.

Monopolies have been present throughout history, though some have gained much more fame than the others. In fact, if one company acquires another company, even that transaction has separate laws to ensure that the acquisition won't result in the creation of a monopoly and such acquisition deals can be reversed by the relevant regulatory authorities to ensure a fair and free market remains. Even now, when such laws are much more strict than they used to be, there are cries of some companies effectively being monopolies and having way too much power. These companies include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because of its app store, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) because of its search dominance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) because of its operating system two decades ago and even AT&T (NYSE:T), which itself is a descendant of one of the most famous monopolies in history. Tech companies have come more under fire though, as their influence is completely unparalleled and there have been talks of breaking companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon, to ensure that their dominance does not remain. Now that Joe Biden has become the new President of the United States, and Democrats have gained control of both the House and the Senate, it does look like there might be a day of reckoning for these companies soon enough. But till, then let's sink our teeth into monopolies that achieved both fame and infamy simultaneously, starting with number 12:

12. Salt Commission

We start off with the oldest organization in our list, for which we have to go back more than 1,200 years, in China. The Salt Commission was an organization created by the State, which had a monopoly on the salt trade in the country. The purpose of the organization was to collect tax from salt trade, and the funny thing is, it took till 2014 for the announcement to be made regarding ending the monopoly on the salt trade by the government.

11. Thurn and Taxis Mail

The private company operated postal service back in the 1800s and enjoyed a monopoly on postal services. The company's dominance came to an end after Prussian victory, after which it transferred over its assets to Prussia. Highest Paying Part-Time Jobs for College Students

10. Hudson's Bay Company

The company had a monopoly on the fur trade in Canada, and is a Canadian company. The company enjoyed this monopoly until the end of 1849, where its power was finally weakened and it had to secede some of the market share it enjoyed over the last couple of centuries. Best Tinder Bios for Tall Guys

9. Luxottica (ESLOF)

It owns nearly every major eyewear brand you've heard of, including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Sears and many more, and has been accused of monopolistic pricing of its premium brands.

8. Dutch East India Company

The company was established in the 17th century to trade with India and had a monopoly on the Dutch spice trade which was incredibly lucrative. The company is infamous for using its power as a monopoly to gain more money and influence, as well as using violence, slavery and colonialism as tactics to keep on growing.

7. Pan Am Airways

Pan Am was in existence from 1927 to 1991 as the largest American airline, and is said to have been a monopoly in the US, where it was also its unofficial flag carrier. Its main claim of being a monopoly came from its international routes, where there was no competition to the airline. 15 Countries with the Strictest Customs, Border Control and Airport Security in the World

6. De Beers

De Beers is one of the most controversial companies among the biggest monopolies of all time, which is saying something. The company is 133 years old and has operations in 35 countries regarding everything related to diamonds including its mining, retail, trading, exploration and manufacturing. It has mines in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Canada and Australia, and has controlled close to 85% of the total diamond trade globally from inception till the start of the 21st, making it a through and through monopoly. While competition has broken the iron grip of the company, its power still remains with 30% of the market share.

- At some point, you applied to Harvard, though--

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Right.

- --and then got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: What was the case was this. When I won the award the very first time at national level, the thing became, what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, Chris Kirubi? So he had been an alumni of Harvard, so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school.

And he had gotten to almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time, so I was supported through the whole application process. And it was really an amazing experience, but then it got to a point, where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this on [? Zetia. ?] So it brought in, like, a new dynamic in the competition.

Because for the first time, what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds. They already had employees, and they were already competing. And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them, so it became a situation, where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead, so that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a weight on this.

And actually, what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of, like, three years by the time I came to think about it again.

Story continues

- Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to-- every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. And at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind, so I wouldn't say, I regret.

GameStop’s stock is on fire, but that has nothing to do with reality

GameStop (GME). Who would have thought the most talked about stock on Wall Street in early 2021 would be a past-its-prime mall retailer? And yet here we are. The company’s stock has gained an incredible 8,949% in the last 12 months at market close Wednesday, with much of that coming in just the last two weeks.

By now the reasons behind GameStop’s massive gains are well documented. The stock has been a major target for short sellers due to the continued shift to digital game sales. But earlier this month, the stock shot up after activist investor and Chewy founder Ryan Cohen joined the video game retailer’s board along with two allies who had previously worked with him.

Traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets board, seeing so many short positions in GameStop, then dove headlong into a massive short squeeze, forcing the stock’s price even higher and crushing short sellers as they moved to buy up stock to cover their losses. Traders from the board have also been squeezing short positions in stocks like AMC (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), and BlackBerry (BB). But GameStop has been the most high-profile target.

One of my best friends put about $24,000 into the stock after reading WallStreetBets and was up as much as $113,000 as of Wednesday afternoon — though he wasn’t going to convince me to get in on the action. A man poses outside a GameStop store with his purchase of a Sony PS5 gaming console in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 12, 2020. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri

The stock’s performance is so far divorced from the reality of its retail operations it’s practically operating in a parallel universe. In its most recent quarter, GameStop’s total sales were down more than 30% compared to the same time last year. Gamers, meanwhile, continue to transition away from buying physical copies of games in favor of digital downloads. And the launch of cloud gaming services spells disaster for traditional game retailers.

Story continues

“GameStop’s problem is not that they don’t do a good job selling video games online — I guess they could do a slightly better job, everyone can — it’s the fact that more and more gamers, they are not buying physical games, they are just downloading them,” Loop Capital Markets’ Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance Live.

“GameStop can have a better website than Amazon, and that’s not going to change that,” he added.

To be sure, some on Wall Street paint a rosier picture for GameStop, noting it has a turn-around plan that focuses on interactive experiences and e-commerce. If that plan doesn’t work, though, the retailer will likely end up as just another Blockbuster — a shell of its former self, with one surviving store in the entire world, if it’s lucky.

GameStop’s pivot

GameStop has struggled for years, but recently pared its losses by focusing on its transition plan that seeks to create a more robust online retail presence. And it’s working to a degree. While the company saw net losses of $470.9 million in fiscal 2019, that was down from $673 million in 2018. And its Q3 2020 earnings saw net losses of $18.8 million compared to the $83.4 million in net losses it saw in Q3 2019.

So things weren’t exactly great, but they were looking up. In fact, the company said in its Q3 earnings report that it would return to profitability in Q4 thanks to the launches of Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox Series S and Series X and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation 5.

But this month, GameStop reported that its holiday sales were down 3.1% year-over-year, as coronavirus forced it to shutter stores temporarily or for good. The retailer was also hit by severe shortages of Microsoft and Sony’s new consoles, which are nearly impossible to find. Believe me, I’ve tried. Inside a GameStop store a worker takes a Sony PS5 gaming console to the counter to sell in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 12, 2020. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri

Bulls are banking on Cohen and his RC Ventures, which bought up GameStop stock and got three new seats on the company’s board on Jan. 11. GameStop has also made plans to improve its standing as an omni-channel destination for everything from games, action figures, and boardgames to TVs, gaming PC, and peripherals.

One optimistic analyst, Joseph Feldman at Telsey Advisory Group, says the company will likely benefit from the release of Microsoft’s and Sony’s consoles when they’re more readily available, as well as its healthy balance sheet and those new product offerings.

“The shift to digital is real, it’s happening, but I’m not sure that it’s going to completely take over the industry,” Feldman told Yahoo Finance.

“People still want to buy consoles which are physical, people still want to own the discs, which are physical. A lot of people do stream it now, much more than they used to, but I don’t know that that means it’s going to entirely go that way. And if it does, it’s going to continue to be a larger transition to that,” he said.

But there’s plenty stacked against GameStop.

The future of gaming is digital and the cloud

Let’s first focus on those new console sales. Microsoft and Sony will eventually increase their inventory of the latest and greatest systems, but GameStop is far from the only retailer to offer them. Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), and others are all selling Xbox Series S and Series X and the PS5.

So while GameStop will likely benefit from those sales, it’s not going to save the retailer in the long-term, especially as the market becomes saturated and fewer people need to buy them.

In the long-term, GameStop also faces a major threat from the shift to digital sales. Since its fiscal Q3 2019, Sony has sold more digital games than physical games, with the company selling 59% digital titles in its fiscal Q2 2020. EA games, meanwhile, said that 56% of titles sold were digital rather than physical in the 12 months preceding its Q2 2021 quarter.

What’s more, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo allow you to download titles to their consoles, offering frequent sales, and making it incredibly easy to buy a game without having to visit a separate website or get up off your couch.

It’s not just the PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch’s dedicated marketplaces taking share from GameStop. PC gamers have Valve’s Steam, EA has its Origins platform, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) has its Battle.net service, and Ubisoft has its Ubisoft Store.

Digital games can pose unique problems, of course. Feldman points out that they require high-speed internet connections that some video players just don’t have access to.

“The pressure point is the infrastructure for it,” he explained. “These games are pretty high volume in terms of the size of the game. And so it requires a pretty wide pipe to get into your house effectively to be played well. I know those sound like the old issues that used to be there, but that’s all still true.”

Still, the rise of 5G connections could bring high-speed internet to more people.

What’s more, digital games aren’t the only alternatives to physical ones. Cloud gaming allows players to access and stream games on devices ranging from game consoles to smart TVs, tablets, and smartphones — heck, you can even play on a 10-year-old laptop that’s been sitting in a closet collecting dust.

Some of these cloud services will require you to purchase digital versions of games, while others will simply let you play via a subscription. Reminds you a bit of how streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX) demolished Blockbuster, right?

That company was once the go-to video and video game rental retailer. But then Netflix came out with its online streaming service, which kicked off a slew of new competitors. And while Blockbuster offered its own streaming service, it simply couldn’t keep up, and filed for bankruptcy in 2010. (Though as a penny stock, it’s skyrocketing thanks to the Reddit trade, too.)

Just like with Blockbuster, it’s probably too late for GameStop to redefine itself many years after you begged your parents to drive you there to buy the latest games. That won’t change no matter how high the retailer’s stock skyrockets.

If that plan doesn’t work, though, the retailer will likely end up as just another Blockbuster — a shell of its former self, with one surviving store in the entire world, if it’s lucky.

GameStop’s pivot

GameStop has struggled for years, but recently pared its losses by focusing on its transition plan that seeks to create a more robust online retail presence. And it’s working to a degree. While the company saw net losses of $470.9 million in fiscal 2019, that was down from $673 million in 2018. And its Q3 2020 earnings saw net losses of $18.8 million compared to the $83.4 million in net losses it saw in Q3 2019.

So things weren’t exactly great, but they were looking up. In fact, the company said in its Q3 earnings report that it would return to profitability in Q4 thanks to the launches of Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox Series S and Series X and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation 5.

But this month, GameStop reported that its holiday sales were down 3.1% year-over-year, as coronavirus forced it to shutter stores temporarily or for good. The retailer was also hit by severe shortages of Microsoft and Sony’s new consoles, which are nearly impossible to find. Believe me, I’ve tried.

Bulls are banking on Cohen and his RC Ventures, which bought up GameStop stock and got three new seats on the company’s board on Jan. 11. GameStop has also made plans to improve its standing as an omni-channel destination for everything from games, action figures, and boardgames to TVs, gaming PC, and peripherals.

One optimistic analyst, Joseph Feldman at Telsey Advisory Group, says the company will likely benefit from the release of Microsoft’s and Sony’s consoles when they’re more readily available, as well as its healthy balance sheet and those new product offerings.

“The shift to digital is real, it’s happening, but I’m not sure that it’s going to completely take over the industry,” Feldman told Yahoo Finance.

“People still want to buy consoles which are physical, people still want to own the discs, which are physical. A lot of people do stream it now, much more than they used to, but I don’t know that that means it’s going to entirely go that way. And if it does, it’s going to continue to be a larger transition to that,” he said.

But there’s plenty stacked against GameStop.

The future of gaming is digital and the cloud

Let’s first focus on those new console sales. Microsoft and Sony will eventually increase their inventory of the latest and greatest systems, but GameStop is far from the only retailer to offer them. Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), and others are all selling Xbox Series S and Series X and the PS5.

So while GameStop will likely benefit from those sales, it’s not going to save the retailer in the long-term, especially as the market becomes saturated and fewer people need to buy them.

In the long-term, GameStop also faces a major threat from the shift to digital sales. Since its fiscal Q3 2019, Sony has sold more digital games than physical games, with the company selling 59% digital titles in its fiscal Q2 2020. EA games, meanwhile, said that 56% of titles sold were digital rather than physical in the 12 months preceding its Q2 2021 quarter.

What’s more, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo allow you to download titles to their consoles, offering frequent sales, and making it incredibly easy to buy a game without having to visit a separate website or get up off your couch.

It’s not just the PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch’s dedicated marketplaces taking share from GameStop. PC gamers have Valve’s Steam, EA has its Origins platform, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) has its Battle.net service, and Ubisoft has its Ubisoft Store.

Digital games can pose unique problems, of course. Feldman points out that they require high-speed internet connections that some video players just don’t have access to.

“The pressure point is the infrastructure for it,” he explained. “These games are pretty high volume in terms of the size of the game. And so it requires a pretty wide pipe to get into your house effectively to be played well. I know those sound like the old issues that used to be there, but that’s all still true.”

Still, the rise of 5G connections could bring high-speed internet to more people.

What’s more, digital games aren’t the only alternatives to physical ones. Cloud gaming allows players to access and stream games on devices ranging from game consoles to smart TVs, tablets, and smartphones — heck, you can even play on a 10-year-old laptop that’s been sitting in a closet collecting dust.

Some of these cloud services will require you to purchase digital versions of games, while others will simply let you play via a subscription. Reminds you a bit of how streaming video services like Netflix (NFLX) demolished Blockbuster, right?

That company was once the go-to video and video game rental retailer. But then Netflix came out with its online streaming service, which kicked off a slew of new competitors. And while Blockbuster offered its own streaming service, it simply couldn’t keep up, and filed for bankruptcy in 2010. (Though as a penny stock, it’s skyrocketing thanks to the Reddit trade, too.)

Just like with Blockbuster, it’s probably too late for GameStop to redefine itself many years after you begged your parents to drive you there to buy the latest games. That won’t change no matter how high the retailer’s stock skyrockets.

130,2021-01-27T19:25:33+00:00,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: There is ‘a big crisis right now’ for cybersecurity,"Microsoft (MSFT) is officially a cybersecurity giant. For the first time on Tuesday, Microsoft disclosed revenue from its various security offerings as part of its quarterly earnings — $10 billion over the last 12 months.

That amounts to a 40% year-over-year jump in the growing security business, making up roughly 7% of the company’s total revenue for the previous year.

“We waited in some sense [until] this milestone to show the depth, the breadth, the span of what we are doing,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Wednesday, a day after the company released its quarterly earnings report.

“And, you know, [there’s] a lot of work ahead, but we are investing very heavily because guess what? You know 10 years from now we'll still be talking about it as technology becomes even [a deeper part] of our lives in our society in all critical industries.”

The $10 billion figure comes from the security-related revenue generated by services including Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory, Intune, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Office 365, Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Information and Governance, Azure Sentinel, Azure Monitoring, and Azure Information Protection. In this May 6, 2019, file photo Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at Build, the company's annual conference for software developers in Seattle. AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)

Each of those makes up what Microsoft calls its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. Those overarching segments generated $14.6 billion and $13.4 billion in revenue, respectively, in the company’s fiscal Q2 2021.

“What we have built is very helpful in times of crisis and there is a big crisis right now,” Nadella said. “But you need to sort of obviously build all of this over a period of years if not decades and then sustain it through not just product innovation, but also I would say, practice every day.”

The announcement follows Microsoft’s involvement in uncovering the breadth of the massive SolarWinds cyber attack in December, which hit private companies like cybersecurity firm FireEye (FEYE) and government agencies including the Treasury, Commerce, and State Departments, as well as the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.

Microsoft itself was also hacked, though no customer data was breached. A Reuters report indicated that, as part of the hack of the National Telecommunications and Information Agency, Microsoft’s Office 365 software was attacked, allowing the intruders to monitor agency emails for months. Microsoft, however, said at the time that it has identified no vulnerabilities in its cloud or Office software.

Though hit by the attack, Microsoft also worked with the government and customers to help determine the scale of the hack.

“I was most proud that we became the first responders for this attack,” Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft corporate vice president of security, compliance, and identity marketing, told Yahoo Finance.

“We were the defenders that other defenders were turning to. We were working with FireEye and across the public sector and private sector coming together saying ‘What should we do, and how should we protect our world against it?’ ” she said. The U.S. Treasury Department was one of the victims of the SolarWinds hack. (Image: Xinhua/ via Getty Images)

Part of Microsoft’s ability to respond to the hack has to do with what’s called “zero trust” architecture, Nadella explained. Essentially that means a company’s cybersecurity capabilities always function as though there has been a breach of some kind. It’s a defense against being left flatfooted when a new hack comes along that you’re not able to protect against.

“One of the things about Microsoft’s investment is really not just about the security investment — which is substantial when you look at Defender or Sentinel or Azure Active Directory and the list goes on — but it is that ability to take all of our investments in AI and data and infrastructure and bring it to bear for security,” Nadella said. “And that I think is what makes us pretty unique.”

Working from home adds to companies’ security needs

The SolarWinds hack came as the coronavirus pandemic spurred many companies to allow their employees to work from home, which introduced a new attack vector for hackers. When you’re working from your office, you’re, hopefully, hooked into a secured connection that can monitor for things like malware or other strange network activity.

At home, though, you’re running on your own network, adding a wrinkle to your employer’s ability to protect itself. It wouldn’t take much for you to download malware on your computer at home, then accidentally send that software to your company’s systems when you connect to its network to update a spreadsheet or upload a report.

“Security has to be built in at every single point,” Jakkal said. “It cannot be an afterthought,”

Microsoft says it currently protects more than 400,000 customers across 120 countries, including 90 Fortune 100 companies. The tech giant breaks its security offerings down into four categories: security, compliance, identity, and management.

Part of that includes providing security not just for Microsoft-powered devices, but those running Apple’s (AAPL) iOS and macOS and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android, as well as products running on competing cloud platforms like Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Google’s Google Cloud Platform.

“There needs to be a real different approach to creating a cybersecurity solution for customers,” Nadella said.

“In what is an interconnected world it's not about any one point solution, it is about having, I would say, an architectural approach, which then needs to be reinforced every day.”

As cloud services continue to expand, and Microsoft’s stake in the industry grows alongside it, protecting the customers who use those services will prove ever more important.

“It is not just transformation in order for you to remain in business. You need to have that digital control plane, not just for your workers so that they can log on to their PCs from home and be on Teams calls,” Nadella said.

“Your manufacturing plant needs to continue where the engineers, the operational data all need to be reasoned over. That is the transformation that I think we are seeing the acceleration of.”

Of course, hackers and cybercriminals will continue to hit at businesses regardless of what company they have protecting them. But with the continued growth in cloud computing and an expanded work-from-home environment, Microsoft stands to benefit as a player in the cybersecurity industry.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: At some point you applied to Harvard, though, and got a scholarship, but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

MUBARAK MUYIKA: Actually, what was the case was this. When I won the award in my very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level, which was the advice of multiple partners, and teachers, and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting the whole event, [INAUDIBLE].

So he had been an alumni of Harvard. And so it felt like the next best thing to do, considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he got into the almost the highest level from a business perspective, so I applied to Harvard. And it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time. So I was supported through the whole application process. And was really an amazing experience.

But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had some of my peers, like had actually won an award, which was this [INAUDIBLE]. So it brought in like a new dynamic in the competition, because for the first time what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing.

And that would take me, like, five years behind for me to actually catch up with them. So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this. I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide, like, I can put a wait on this.

And actually what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first. Then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

MUBARAK MUYIKA: I actually, I never thought about it like that, because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs, because the problem at the time was I used to every time I'd look at multiple people and peers, I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me?

So that whole thing used to be like that. So at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret it.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: It's often said that life is about the journey, not the destination. Well, Mubarak Muyika's path to success is like none you've ever heard. Growing up in Kenya's middle class and orphaned at a young age, opportunities in a tech industry were limited. But as Mubarak tells it, he refused to be a victim. Driven by his competitive spirit and win at all cost attitude, Mubarak first revealed his knack for technology by taking the top spot in not one, but two, nationwide science fairs and went on to launch a web services business at the age of 17.

Now at 26 years old, Mubarak is in Silicon Valley with a new company and a dream to bring big tech to Africa's small businesses. In this episode of Influencers, I'm joined by Mubarak Muyika, founder and president of Zagace, as we discuss his entrepreneurial journey, why he turned down a scholarship from Harvard, and what he admires about billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.

[INTERLUDE MUSIC]

- Hello and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace, an enterprise software company, and Mubarak joins us from Nairobi. Mubarak, nice to see you.

- Thank you very much for having me here.

- So I want to ask you about your company, and it's fascinating, and you've got an incredible story. First of all, why don't you tell us about what Zagace does.

- Zagace is an enterprise management platform that seeks to make enterprise software basic and accessible to all with a focus for small businesses. That's basically what Zagace does, and that's what it is.

ANDY SERWER: And who do you compete with? And who are your customers? And how does that all work?

Story continues

MUBARAK MUYIKA: We compete with a number of customers that are described as point tools. So the first point tool that we consider a competitor is Quickbooks, Quickbooks and TurboTax. These are primary competitors, but they don't address the direct line of business that we're in because we have a suit of products that focus on making a full experience for small businesses, but TurboTax and Quickbooks tend to focus more on accounting and the taxation piece.

So we tend to address a wide range of business, small business needs. So you find that small customers tend to use a variety of tools. They could use Excel at one point, you could use a different subscription, so when you tend to look at the experience of a small business, it's more like-- it's just a chaotic alternative to Zagace. They are-- they have all these subscriptions they have to use.

- And are your customers in Africa? Are they all over the world?

- We have customers in over 60 countries. Our primary and largest customer market is in Africa, but then over time, the business-- the business needs and the business pardons are almost the same in different parts of the world. So it's enabled us to acquire customers from different parts of the world.

- I want to talk about your story, as I mentioned. It's a pretty incredible one, but you had personal tragedy. You were orphaned at a young age, and then started a business when you were 17. Can you talk about your upbringing first for us?

- OK, so I grew up-- I grew up in a household that was pretty middle-class from a Kenyan standard. At the time, that's in the 90s, being born in the 90s. My dad being a civil servant. So it was a pretty middle-class standard type of lifestyle. And then when my dad passed on, there used to be a number of circumstances that we started to experience that's from we were having issues keeping up with our active lifestyle, our beating on beetles, living a single mother, so it was really a challenge. So in all that period, it was an environment that was super competitive because we used to have multiple relatives and multiple friends that we didn't have. Suddenly, we couldn't keep up. So it used to feel like it was really a big deal to keep up.

So in that whole process, at a later time a couple of years later, I lost my mom, too. So when I lost my mom, it became a point where it required that I personally start to take care my younger brother and start to be like, I thought a thing, and make sure that all problems that we have are solved, not more than just it, but they needed kind of solutions. So in that whole process where multiple relatives supported, and then in the whole process of supporting, I had grown up being a competitive person. That's from my childhood. I like video games. I've always wanted to win. So it was always a thing of mine.

So in that whole process, I figure that, me, I'm not going to be a victim of any of this kind of stuff. So my only thing is that what's my play? And how I'm going to win. So that's what I became my focus. So when I got into high school, the very first thing that really changed my perspective in high school was the fact that I actually never got into a high school that I really wanted to because I kind of felt like, it wasn't the really best, but it was really good. And so it made me feel like I got beat at some point, something that I'm not used to. You know, I've gotten used to winning, getting what I want.

So when you fail to get that at some point, it makes you feel like you need to compete even better. So when that began to happen in high school, we had this situation or school arrangement where there were science fairs that you could participate in, and compete in schools all over the country. So it had multiple stages. So you'd have to come up with, a project convince people to with you convince multiple people to support it by allocating resources and multiple things.

So from that whole experience I got into it I go to a national level when I was about 17. That was I was actually-- I was actually not 17. I was 16. Then that was just I was the youngest person to get to the national level. It was a completely new experience. For the first time at my age I could see people from different schools. I had a perspective that was a national level. So the whole thing about it was that it became a new reality that I had to embrace.

So with that, the following year now, I became the best, and when I became the best at national level, I had known a couple of people so many times. So the thing was now, what's the next thing? The next thing was now how do I look at it from an international level? So you know that in high school, I won two awards at the national level. And that's the science fairs, although I had multiple projects, all of them at the national level. But the two of them that I won was more of a perspective of things that were my interests, things that I liked, and things that I really believed were the best.

And so with that, it changed my game from an aspect of persons that I interacted with because the largest companies in Kenya were the ones supporting the events. So it felt like a really new experience. So with that, a whole new angle came in. Some of the participants that were in older theme, I'd really defeated them, and then there was this aspect of an African competition called the Anzisha prize. So it used to be it was more like I'd been beaten at a point or something that I didn't know about. So I entered it the following year, and I actually won an award for the work that I was doing with a company called Hype Century.

So Hype Century was a company that I started when I was in my final year in high school. The specific thing about it was it came as a result of my initial innovation, which was creation of a database to track multiple tracking tracks for oil tankers, and for just purposes of management office of management of a business. So with all that I used to get requests from clients to build websites, and then in that whole process of building websites, the clients was starting to stock up. And when they started to build so many, what used to be the case I got-- I decided to structure our business in which companies could pay subscriptions.

- And then, let me just jump in here, so at some point, you applied to Harvard though,

- Right.

- And then got a scholarship but decided not to go. Tell us about that.

- What was the case was this: when I won the award in my-- the very first time at national level, the thing became what's the next best thing for somebody of that level? Which was the advice of multiple partners and teachers and stakeholders that were involved in my life, including one of the gentlemen of the companies that was supporting that the whole event, Chris Kerubi. So he had been an alumni of Harvard, and so it felt like the next best thing to do-- considering he's also an alumni of my school, and he'd got into almost the highest level from a business perspective --so I applied to Harvard, and it was something that I felt like was the best thing for me at the time.

So I was supported through the whole application process, and it was really an amazing experience. But then it got to a point where I did not know about this piece about where I had set some of my peers, had actually won an award which was this Anzisha. So it brought in a new dynamic in the competition because for the first time, what I felt I was going to do at Harvard from a software engineering perspective, I felt like some of my peers already had raised funds, they already had employees, and they were already competing, and that would take me five years behind for me to actually catch up with them.

So it became a situation where I decided, no, scrap this, I have to remain ahead. So that whole process made me decide I can put a wait on this, and actually, what I decided at the time is that I'm not going to think about this Harvard thing anymore. I just want to win first, then in the process of winning, that became a process of three years by the time I get to think about it again.

- Did you ever have any regrets about not going to Harvard?

- I actually-- I never thought about it like that because my thing about it was winning. I wanted to win at all costs because the problem at the time was I used to-- every time I look at multiple people and peers I'd be like, what does it take to be number one? What's so different from that guy and me? So that whole thing used to be like that, so and at the time, there were multiple people who I felt had beaten me. And if I was going to go down that road, I was going to be five years behind. And so I wouldn't say I regret, I just think that there was a different path to take.

- Right. And you made your way to Silicon Valley eventually. Talk to us about that.

- Yeah, so the very first thing was, you know, with this whole experience about raising money, reality started to set in from a business perspective. So the ecosystem in Kenya and Africa is pretty much very small, and the equals really small at the time. So from a fundraising perspective, we were looking at a situation where I already had close to 1,000 business customers in Nairobi from a perspective of 2013-2014.

That was really huge because if you have really huge corporate customers, any expansion in business would mean extending into a business line that's outside of my scope of excellence, or my scope of expertise. So it got to a point where the only most relevant place where it would be practical to expand to and move to, would be the Bay area because of the time, I had multiple contacts I had interacted with from investors to customers to different mentors who were helping out, and they had multiple people that had been supported to move to the Bay Area to raise funding, get customers, so it became a thing that was the next best thing to do when you reach a certain customer point. So it is at that point that it became obvious and necessary that moving into the Bay Area is the next most practical thing.

So what I decided to do, I decided that this is an important and crucial thing. So I made a business decision to decide to expand to the Bay Area. That was like having the company registered, getting an office, and moving to the Bay Area to start initially with a focus to get investors. But then when I got to the Bay Area, the thing of the time was I didn't think that it would turn out the way it did because I think the experience was so blissful because 1, at the time, there was this thing that Obama was a Kenyan.

So when I got to the Bay Area, being a Kenyan was just like the coolest thing I'd ever experienced in my life. I was treated so well. I was invited to so many places. I used to get so many messages and so many emails that it took me to close to two years to actually read them because at the time, the experience was just exciting. That whole process, I figure that there's actually a possibility of value and expansion in terms of business from things like joint ventures, from things like partnerships, where products can actually-- products from Africa can actually be sold to different customers bundled together and that whole that whole thing.

So in that whole process, I figured out a way in which we can structure a corporation. That's good advice from multiple mentors and multiple partners who are helping out, and that's pretty much how I ended up in the Bay Area. Then ever since, it's been more like-- it's been more like a thing that's been really good because it's really helped the business development around the world because that single thing has given Zagace the ability to acquire customers in multiple places around the world with so much ease, and the level of sophistication also changed significantly because the amount of data that we were working with in Nairobi as a Nairobi company, is really different from what we do now as a multinational company. And then the operations--

- And you mentioned how it was advantageous to be from Africa when Barack Obama was president, had things gotten more difficult when Donald Trump was president? Because, of course, he notoriously denigrated African countries.

- I'd say that Trump is more of a businessman than Obama, so the thing is what happens is that at the time, people didn't meet me like a businessman. People met me as a Kenyan. So during Trump's time, I did both. I had grown up so my interactions with people are more business, terms, agreements. So I'd say that it didn't affect much, it was just at a different time, and not grown up.

- Right, OK. So Zagace found a market in the trend of African companies going online. Where does that trend stand now? And has COVID-19 accelerated that?

- Big time, big time. As of today, we are doing close to 10 million sign-ups-- businesses that we've acquired through multiple product stocks from businesses that have signed up online from resellers or partnerships. With all that, we've gotten approximately two million customers. So this whole process is-- 70% of the customers come from Africa, and it's largely driven by COVID-19.

And then the other thing about it is that what's really driving growth in Africa isn't really COVID-19, it's about big tech politics in the Bay Area, because you realize that the technical system in Africa isn't controlled in Africa. If you want to expand a business in Africa, it doesn't make sense to really invest in Africa. You invest in the Bay Area, because that's where the talent that's where is the big tech. And so it's more of we are at the point where the next billion customers for the big tech, the big five, are going to come from Africa. We are talking about a population that's going to be joining the internet as users or becoming banked users. That's from an aspect of fintech.

Persons who have no-- persons who have no access to banking facilities or have no access to internet, and it also presents a direct opportunity considering the countries are so many, and it's so different. So regulation is easy to go around as compared to a country like India, which offers the same opportunity for big tech in the Bay Area. So the thing about it becomes that the only way we can live with the trend in Africa, to become a big tech company in Africa, we have to be like the big five in the Bay Area, and they're like, we are, we follow them, so we're just like a bear on their back.

- Let me-- I want to get back to Zagace in a minute though, but I want to ask you about COVID in Kenya and in East Africa generally? What is the situation like there right now?

- The situation-- I think the situation is really-- could be really bad, but the problem is that 1, the economy is really bad. And then the process of tracking it is really slow. So we cannot get an accurate picture in the short term. So right now the information is foggy and hazy, but what I'd say the situation could be really bad because what's on the ground and what's reported takes time before you can actually match the two.

- Right. So getting back to your company, how big is it right now, Mubarak, in terms of revenue? And what are the key ingredients for growth?

- I think from an aspect of last year, we did around $2 million in revenue. And the key aspects of growth are we're talking about users, APIs, those are just the main things that are driving growth in the short term. And here we're talking about users, we talk about small businesses, and individual solopreneurs.

- Right, and how fast is the company growing right now? How do you measure that?

- I'd say during-- since COVID started, we've done close to 5 million sign-ups, businesses that we would never had access to that we do have access to right now from the multiple product stocks.

- Right. Do you think there is room for a company like you in enterprise software with all the big giants like Salesforce and Oracle?

- Big time. There is so much room for us because you see the biggest problem about small businesses is usually around customer lifetime cycles and the support cost. So our innovation isn't really enterprise software. Our innovation is the distribution. What we've innovated is the distribution. So the main reason why we built Zagace is more of to make enterprise software basic and accessible to all. So the enterprise software already existed, and it will continue to exist, but is it an Oracle thing to make it basic and accessible to all? Definitely not, and that's not their business.

So and then the other thing is that the economics around getting small business owners and solopreneurs are completely different from enterprise customers because from the time they begin to pay from the amount of data that it requires to collect for them to actually find value in those products, so there is room for us. Big time.

- You talked about how you were accepted when you went to Silicon Valley because you're from Kenya, but on the other hand, have you faced any issues of discrimination or being limited in terms of the capital that you like to get because you're a person of color?

- I'd say how I'd look at it is more I felt that, but I haven't felt-- I haven't experienced it directly because I've been fortunate because at the time that most of the people that I got to interact with were persons that looked at me as a person of industry, as a professional in the industry. So it wasn't more of a startup thing, and in as much as the discrimination exists, I didn't experience it because of a controlled network and a controlled group of people that were helping me out. So, yes, it's there, from an aspect of larger rounds, but then I haven't had first-hand customer experience where someone has directly done it to me as a person individually.

- Do you see other people in your shoes in Kenya and maybe beyond in Africa who need financing who can't get it? Or do they have access to capital?

- I think it's a really big problem in Africa, but there you see in terms of corporate, if your structure matches as a corporate, there are many ways to go around some of those things, because I think about it like this: if I have $50 billion that I am to give to somebody in the Bay Area and to give to someone in Nairobi, I definitely have a preference for someone that I know in an environment that I know. So if you look at it from that perspective, I think it isn't more about discrimination, it's about how to structure it because it's more about just going for it.

People tend to work with people that they feel comfortable around and people that they feel comfortable with. So I look at it from that perspective, as a as opposed to an aspect of discrimination because the issue is usually yes, you can say this discrimination, but is there really value or too much of the need for that money? Because the problem becomes in as much as there are so many people who don't have funding, there are also not very good innovative stuff that need accurate a money. Most of it is just stuff that can't pass the statistical, [INAUDIBLE] viable to meet those investment needs. So if you look at it from that perspective, any business or innovation that is financially viable and sustainable over time can have access to funding with proper corporate structuring that can still be [INAUDIBLE] discrimination problems.

- What tech companies are-- American tech companies --have large market shares in Nairobi? In other words, is it Apple? Is it Facebook? Is it Twitter? Do people use Skype? What are the tech products and services that Kenyans use?

- We're talking like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and yeah, I think WhatsApp. So pretty much those are the main ones from an aspect of the largest number of customer ba-- actually Facebook is more of a pointer, in terms of how we grow in the business because of their style of business operation.

- And I want to ask you about microfinance because that's a popular way for Western entrepreneurs to support businesses in developing countries. Do you see that in Kenya much? And what do you think about that?

- Microfinance is a really reliable thing because it creates a personal relationship between the financing and the persons involved, but then the thing about it is that it may be good for small scale, but the impact-- the impact is only from an aspect of getting out of poverty but not big business growth. It's the one for small businesses and individuals from a poverty perspective, and it's really sustainable, but when it comes to big business, I think it's a really unsustainable model because it creates politics in big business and then brings in unnecessary bureaucracy from an aspect of big business operation.

- Mubarak, you mentioned that the economy is not very good in Kenya. Why is that?

- I think it's because of one-- there's a discrepancy between information that we acquired from debt and corruption matter, so what usually happens is that the stories that we read today are information that will take more like three months for you to actually get a clearer picture of what's going on, and that's from an aspect of government information and independently collaborated information because we have constant information being disputed over time.

So the only way you can have information that's constantly reliable is that it takes like three months or something like that. So the economy-- the economy's really bad because of one the debt thing, and then the COVID situation, and then you add to that the corruption, so when you bring in the corruption in the equation, information exchange gets hazy because we cannot tell what up to a certain point when it's undisputable, or indisputable.

- Do you live full time in Nairobi? Or do you split time between Nairobi and Silicon Valley? Where do you-- where do you live most of the time?

- I actually moved full time to Silicon Valley. I only-- I only come to Nairobi once in a while because it's more of I have family and family ties and things like those, so it's more I moved to the Bay Area fully.

- Who are your role models, Mubarak, in terms of tech CEOs and leaders and maybe people in other fields of endeavor? And for instance, Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard. Do you-- do you look to them?

- I'd say I look to Bill Gates quite a bit from an aspect of competitiveness and from an aspect of focus because he has this ability to look at things and look at them to a level until he gets what he wants. But I think what I borrow mostly-- who I borrow mostly from is Warren Buffett because I think Warren Buffett represents-- he represents a mature American business person that is so neatly organized and thorough and to the point.

- Have you ever met Warren Buffett or been to the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting?

- No, but I will one day.

- And what about the rest of your career in your life, Mubarak? You're only 26 years old. What are your aspirations? What do you hope to achieve over the next decade and throughout your lifetime?

- No, I think the most important thing is to figure out a way in which I can make enterprise software basic and accessible to all. That's around the world, just not in Africa. Thanks to statistics and newly acquired information that informs insight on multiple things. So I think for the foreseeable decade, that I think is what I really want to achieve because what we've been able to do is make enterprise software standard, which was something that was really not possible in the past.

- And last question, Mubarak. If you could ask Warren Buffett one question, what would it be?

- I'd say investment, but then yeah, I'd say investments.

- You'd ask him about investment?

- Right. Not actually investment. I'd actually ask him to invest with me.

- Oh, you would ask him to invest. Right. Good one. Love it. All right we're going to have to leave it there. Mubarak Muyika, who is the founder and president of Zagace. Thank you so much for joining us, Mubarak.

- Thank you.

133,2021-01-26T09:03:25+00:00,Tencent Shares Tumble After Approaching $1 Trillion Valuation,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. slumped after a world-beating surge in the stock pushed its market value to the cusp of $1 trillion for the first time.

The Chinese Internet behemoth lost 6.3% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization below $890 billion. Traders took profit after Monday’s 11% rally, which was Tencent’s biggest in almost a decade. Adding to the caution were comments by an adviser to China’s central bank at a conference, reported by local media, indicating that excessive liquidity was creating asset bubbles.

Thousands of bullish Tencent options lost almost all their value, after some surged as much as 118,300% on Monday. The frenzy in derivatives trading pushed the cost of one-month Tencent options to the highest since March 2014 relative to those tracking the Hong Kong benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The prospect that China will tighten funding conditions threatens to derail Tencent’s stock rally, which has been underpinned by a relentless flow of capital from the mainland. Onshore funds have purchased a record amount of Hong Kong shares this month, with about a quarter of that targeting Tencent. As more than a billion people use its WeChat social-media platform, Tencent is ubiquitous to Chinese investors who have no access to Hong Kong shares of rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. through the trading links.

Tencent was the most recent mega-cap company to benefit from investor enthusiasm for the tech sector, with its looming milestone a marker for the euphoria sweeping the stocks globally. Before Tuesday, the stock had added $251 billion in January alone -- by far the biggest creation of shareholder wealth worldwide. Warnings are rising that easy monetary policy is fueling bubbles in global equities, especially in the U.S., where gains have been led by the Nasdaq.

As investors seek cheaper alternatives, they’ve been piling into Hong Kong equities. That’s helped make the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks in the past month.

Story continues

While Tencent has long been an investor favorite in Asia, returning more than 100,000% since its 2004 initial public offering as of Monday, there are other risks to the rally.

In 2018, a government crackdown on China’s online gaming industry squeezed Tencent’s most profitable business, which at the time accounted for about 40% of its revenue. Coupled with a slowing Chinese economy and a weakening yuan, Beijing’s nine-month halt on approvals for new games contributed to a 22% slump in the shares.

A campaign against monopolistic practices since late last year has targeted many of the industries in which Tencent and rival Alibaba operate, including the online payments industry. But while increasing regulatory risk has left Alibaba’s shares about 18% lower than their October peak, Tencent has closed at a record in seven of the past nine sessions.

Tencent would be the second Chinese firm to join the trillion-dollar club after PetroChina Co., which was briefly worth more than that in late 2007 before collapsing in value. U.S. tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also worth more than $1 trillion each, as is Saudi Arabian Oil Co.

Tencent was founded in 1998 by four college classmates and a friend from Shenzhen who devised a Chinese version of the instant messaging service ICQ. Led by “Pony” Ma Huateng -- ma is Chinese for “horse” -- the company’s chat software became the primary communication tool for a generation of young Chinese.

Tencent’s surge has outpaced all but the most bullish analysts’ forecasts. The stock’s closing level of HK$766.50 on Monday was almost 10% higher than the consensus 12-month price target compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 2014.

Investing.com -- Stocks recovered early losses on Monday to kick off a busy week of earnings reports from big tech companies, with hopes for a swift approval of new stimulus fading from view.

There were a couple of eye-popping moves in stocks as the short-selling favorite GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) whipsawed. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) soared after the CEO said recent successful fundraising means there’s no need for a bankruptcy filing.

President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus, but it faces resistance with Republicans in the Senate. The thinking now is that the administration will have to scale back some of its ambitions or present the stimulus in a series of smaller packages.

Financial and energy stocks fell on Monday, with the latter pressured by weaker oil prices on demand worries. The Federal Reserve starts its regular two-day meeting on Tuesday and will likely discuss the state of the economic recovery.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. GameStop captivates the investing public

GameStop, the video game retailer, is the topic of the town lately after its shares have been taken on a wild ride by short sellers and retail investors. On Monday, the stock jumped more than 140% in volatile morning trading but then gave it all back, and then rose again, even with intermittent trading halts.

Analysts don’t think the stunning run-up in the shares is justified. On Monday, Telsey Advisory Group downgraded it to a sell-equivalent from a buy-equivalent. At about $85 as of midday, the shares will likely continue to be extremely volatile. Buckle (NYSE:BKE) your seatbelts.

2. Earnings from AMD and Microsoft

This is a big week for corporate earnings, and after Tuesday’s closing bell we get reports from AMD and Microsoft.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to report earnings per share of 47 cents on revenue of $3 billion. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to report EPS of $1.64 on revenue of $40.2 billion.

Story continues

3. Fed starts its regular meeting

It’s the Federal Reserve’s first meeting under the Biden administration, which has floated a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, including payments to families and money for states and local economies.

The Fed has pledged to back the economy in any way it can. The central bank’s latest rate decision is due out on Wednesday, and observers expect rates to be held steady with further commentary about the outlook for an economic revival.

Consumer confidence is one way of getting things back on track. The reading for the current month is due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) on Tuesday.

138,2021-01-25T05:00:00+00:00,SAP CEO’s Comeback Plan Rankles Investors of European Tech Giant,"(Bloomberg) -- In Christian Klein’s first year as sole chief executive officer at SAP SE, the company’s shares had their worst performance in 12 years. The pandemic damaged sales. And he lost his co-CEO in a high-profile ouster that eliminated the only woman running a large, publicly traded German company.

Klein has a bold plan to turn things around. It hinges on getting customers to adopt a suite of new cloud-based products that work faster and cost less to distribute and maintain. The aim is to put Europe’s largest software company on par with a generation of nimbler upstarts, such as Salesforce.com Inc. He’ll also need to find investor support for the expensive program in the middle of an economic slump.

“If I had one wish for 2021, it would be that we can see a year where we can consistently execute our strategy and prove that it is the right one,” Klein said in an interview.Weaning users off older products carries risks. SAP works with large enterprises with a low tolerance for disruptions. And the switchover is cutting into profit, trading big upfront payments for smaller subscription installments. Though Klein knew the decision wouldn’t necessarily win applause from investors, they were initially supportive, he said.

But as the company put the strategy into motion, customers radically scaled back their software purchases as they grappled with fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. In an unscheduled announcement late on a Sunday night in October, SAP slashed its sales outlook and said growth and margin improvement would be limited for the next two years.Shares collapsed 22% the next day, wiping more than 30 billion euros ($37 billion) from the company’s market value. A January update showed signs of success in moving customers to the cloud, though the company warned the pandemic will continue hurting sales.

Klein – a 40-year-old who’s spent his entire adult life at the Walldorf, Germany-based company after joining as a student in 1999 – has pushed forward during the first month of the new year. The company’s announced high-profile management changes, chief among them naming Julia White, a nearly 20-year Microsoft Corp. veteran, head of marketing.

Story continues

The company also expanded its partnership with Microsoft and will integrate some of their products, including adding Teams to SAP’s software. And SAP is moving ahead with plans to raise as much as $1.28 billion from listing a stake in its Qualtrics International Inc. unit.

Still, Klein will have to convince investors to go along for the ride in a transition that could ultimately take years, in the middle of a pandemic that’s continuing to hammer customers.

AXA Investment Managers, which has held a stake in SAP for 20 years, cut its European funds’ holding in the company by a third in November “to acknowledge the fact that on a short-term basis we have lost some momentum,” said Gilles Guibout, a portfolio manager. Though Guibout agrees a faster move to the cloud is necessary, SAP’s course correction is likely to mean the company has to “over invest” for the next three years, he said.

With a market value of more than 128 billion euros, SAP is Europe’s sole contender to rival U.S. enterprise software giants such as Salesforce and Oracle Corp. Its founders, Hasso Plattner and Dietmar Hopp, are Europe’s two richest tech billionaires with a combined net worth of just over $24 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Plattner, who remains at the company as its chairman and largest shareholder, backed Klein after the shares dropped in October, buying an additional 249 million euros in stock in a show of support.

“When one of the largest shareholders buys more shares it gives me confidence,” Klein said. “I got that feedback from the whole supervisory board.”

It wasn’t the first time Plattner had taken Klein’s side. Klein had initially shared the CEO role with Jennifer Morgan in the U.S. She was an outgoing, American marketing guru with experience running the company’s most crucial business, the cloud division. He was the workhorse and former chief operating officer, more comfortable behind the scenes. The two were initially seen as complements.

But the pandemic frayed the relationship as different time zones and outlooks slowed decision making and caused clashes.

Klein got the news that the supervisory board had voted Morgan out on April 20, the same day his second child was born. Plattner told employees in a memo at the time that it was “crucial to have one sole CEO navigate us through this unprecedented change.” Klein has said the pair disagreed on several decisions, and his last few conversations with Morgan were “pretty emotional,” but declined to say more.

Now on his own, Klein also had to confront the legacy of his predecessor Bill McDermott.

For Klein’s plan to work, SAP has to be able to offer customers a suite of products that work together seamlessly. But McDermott liked to buy his way into new technologies, spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions during his approximately 10-year tenure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shopping spree put together a collection of businesses that may have helped modernize SAP’s offerings, but weren’t necessarily well integrated.

McDermott’s strategy showed mixed results, and SAP attracted the attention of notorious activist Elliott Management Corp., which built up a stake and demanded the company focus on its profit and share price. The company announced changes in 2019 that appeased the group, though McDermott resigned months later saying that a decade was “a long time” to be CEO.The Qualtrics IPO later this year will represent a high profile break with the past as the company sells a stake in McDermott’s biggest deal. The U.S. business, which makes software for conducting customer surveys, cost SAP $8 billion about two years ago.

This year is set to be crucial for SAP, when the nearly half-century old German software giant must prove to investors and customers that it can put past missteps behind it keep up with its larger U.S. rivals.

“SAP is really at a turning point right now because we think there’s this once-in-a-lifetime vulnerability happening,” said Julie Bhusal Sharma, an analyst for Morningstar Inc. “What he’ll have to deal with is making this migration a much smoother process for its existing customer base, I think that thus far it’s been ruffling a lot of feathers.”

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: KIMBERLY-CLARK

Kimberly-Clark, an American multinational personal care corporation, is expected to report a profit of $1.62 in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a year-over-year decline of about 5.2% from the same quarter a year ago when the company reported $1.71 cents per share.

However, Wall Street forecasts the company’s revenue to grow over 3% to $4.7 from the same period year ago. For full-year 2020, revenue is expected to be at $19.1 billion.

“We maintain our Buy-rating and above-consensus EPS estimate into KMB’s 4Q report BMO on Monday. Kimberly Clark’s (KMB) shares have lagged staples as the market remains concerned about moderating POS trends in Dec/Jan and commodities; however, we see an upside to Street 4Q20 and ’21/’22 ests. w/commodity inflation reasonably reflected at current spots and view the bar as low into the print w/KMB trading at 16x P/E (30% discount to HPC peers vs. 20% hist. avg.),” noted Kevin Grundy, equity analyst at Jefferies, who rated the paper products giant “Buy” and set the price target at $152.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: MICROSOFT

MICROSOFT: The global technology giant is expected to report a profit of $1.64 in the fiscal second quarter, which represents year-over-year growth of about 8.6% from the same quarter last year when the company reported $1.51 per share.

The world’s largest software maker’s revenue is forecasts come at $40.23, up from the $36.91 billion reported the same quarter a year earlier.

“Q2 results likely highlight the durability of Microsoft‘s commercial businesses and conservatism in forward consensus expectations. After clearing tough Q2 product cycle comps and lingering COVID-19 impacts, strong secular positioning and an attractive multiple make Microsoft (MSFT) a top stock for the recovery,” said Keith Weiss, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“At 26x CY22e GAAP EPS, MSFT trades at a premium to the S&P, warranted due to MSFT‘s premium return profile. Multiple expansion will likely come from gaining comfort in the durability of commercial business gross profit dollars.”

Johnson & Johnson, one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive manufacturers of healthcare products, will post earnings of $1.83 per share for last quarter of 2020.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: APPLE, TESLA, FACEBOOK

APPLE: The consumer electronics giant is expected to report profit growth of more than 12% of $1.41 in the fiscal first quarter of 2021 on sales of $102.61 billion, highlighted growth of over 11% from the year-ago quarter. That growth is largely driven by a strong demand iPhone handset, Mac computers, iPad tablets and wearables in the holiday season.

“Our December quarter revenue of $108.2B is 5% above consensus, while our EPS of $1.50 is 7% above consensus. We expect demand strength to continue and our FY21 revenue and EPS estimates are both 5% above consensus,” wrote Katy Huberty, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Given positioning into the quarter is muted after the rotation out of high-quality stocks over the past several months, we expect strong follow-through post-earnings and are buyers into the print. We also raise our price target to $152, from $144, as we mark our price target to market accounting for recent peer multiple expansion.”

TESLA: The California-based electric vehicle and clean energy company is expected to report a profit of $1.04 in the fourth quarter of 2020, posting a profit for the sixth straight quarter. The manufacturer of high-performance electric vehicles’ revenue is forecast to surge about 35% to $10 billion.

“A double-fly-wheel. We believe Tesla can leverage its cost leadership in EVs to aggressively expand its user base, over time generating a higher % of revenue from recurring/high-margin services revenue. Services drive the upside. We forecast Tesla’s (TSLA) network services EBITDA as a % of total TSLA EBITDA to reach 11% by 2025, 19% by 2030 and 37% by 2040. Tesla Service revenue includes automated driving, infotainment, upgrades, supercharging, maintenance, telematics, etc.,” said Adam Jonas, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Valuation supportive vs. tech. Including Network Services, Energy & Insurance to our core auto forecasts, at $810 Tesla trades at 25x EV/EBITDA in 2025 and 5x 2025 sales. Expensive vs. auto but not vs. software/tech comps.”

FACEBOOK: The world’s largest online social network is expected to report a profit of $3.16 in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents year-over-year growth of 23.4% from the same quarter a year ago when the company reported $2.56 cents per share.

According to the Zacks Research, the social media conglomerate’s revenue will increase of 24.7% to $26.29 billion from the year-ago, largely driven by solid ad-revenue growth amid advertiser demand during the holiday period.

“Monetization Potential: We are positive on FB‘s monetization roll-out of Instagram as well as FB’s ability to continue to innovate and improve its monetization (Canvas Ads, Dynamic Ads, video). Combined with the high and growing engagement we see monetization upside going forward,” noted Brian Nowak, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

“Investing from Position of Strength to Drive Faster Long-Term Growth: We are modeling 29% GAAP opex (excl. one-time items) growth in 2021, implying an incremental $15bn in opex. Our base case model implies opex per employee moderates in ’21 while FB hiring remains roughly flat on an absolute basis. We believe FB will grow EPS at a 28% CAGR (2019-2022).”

Most of the suppliers of Honor Device Co., the budget phone brand sold by Huawei last November, have resumed doing business with the newly created company, Honor’s chief executive George Zhao said. There’s no restriction when choosing component and software suppliers, said Zhao, adding that it’s in talks with other firms including Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Micron Technology Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

Huawei had hived off Honor to a Chinese government-backed consortium last year as the technology giant grappled with Trump administration sanctions that cut off its supply of mobile chipsets. The Shenzhen-based company is said to have safeguarded its core telecom equipment business by stockpiling critical components to continue supplying its home country’s 5G rollout but it lacks inventory for its smartphone business, which was once larger than Samsung’s.

Honor’s latest smartphones featuring fifth-generation wireless capability use mobile chips developed by Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek, the company announced on Friday. Its new laptop is equipped with Intel’s central processing units and a graphic processor made by Nvidia.

“Based on global consumer needs, Honor has the flexibility and independence to choose the best solutions for its global supply chain,” the company said in a statement announcing its newest line-up. “Honor has already confirmed partnerships with leading suppliers such as AMD, Intel, MediaTek, Micron Technology, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, SK Hynix and Sony.”

A MediaTek spokesman didn’t immediately reply to questions about whether it had entered into an agreement with Honor. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to emails from Bloomberg News seeking comments.

Most of the suppliers of Honor Device Co., the budget phone brand sold by Huawei last November, have resumed doing business with the newly created company, Honor’s chief executive George Zhao said. There’s no restriction when choosing component and software suppliers, said Zhao, adding that it’s in talks with other firms including Qualcomm Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Micron Technology Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

Huawei had hived off Honor to a Chinese government-backed consortium last year as the technology giant grappled with Trump administration sanctions that cut off its supply of mobile chipsets. The Shenzhen-based company is said to have safeguarded its core telecom equipment business by stockpiling critical components to continue supplying its home country’s 5G rollout but it lacks inventory for its smartphone business, which was once larger than Samsung’s.

Honor’s latest smartphones featuring fifth-generation wireless capability use mobile chips developed by Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek, the company announced on Friday. Its new laptop is equipped with Intel’s central processing units and a graphic processor made by Nvidia.

“Based on global consumer needs, Honor has the flexibility and independence to choose the best solutions for its global supply chain,” the company said in a statement announcing its newest line-up. “Honor has already confirmed partnerships with leading suppliers such as AMD, Intel, MediaTek, Micron Technology, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, SK Hynix and Sony.”

A MediaTek spokesman didn’t immediately reply to questions about whether it had entered into an agreement with Honor. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to emails from Bloomberg News seeking comments.

145,2021-01-21T21:02:35+00:00,Business travel will 'snap back' sooner than people think: real estate finance CEO,"Business travelers are the most lucrative customer for the hospitality industry, and they were all but wiped out during the coronavirus pandemic.

The business travel sector is not expected to have a full recovery until 2024, according to a new American Hotel & Lodging Association report out Thursday. The AHLA forecasts business travel to be down 85% compared to 2019 through April 2021, and then will only tick up slightly.

Traveling for work comprises the largest source of hotel revenue, which heavily relies on conference programming to buoy the business. Direct spending on business travel, including for meetings and events, reached $334.2 billion in 2019 and fell to $141 billion in 2020, according to the U.S. Travel Association. Meetings and conferences typically account for 38% of the total spending.

Even with tens of millions of Americans getting at least their first dosage of the coronavirus vaccine, supply issues and new variants of the virus could cause more unseen damage. Still, some executives are feeling more bullish than ever on the return of the business trip.

Willy Walker, the chief executive and chairman of commercial real estate financing company Walker & Dunlop (WD), said he believes business travel will come roaring back soon, and it will be a bandwagon effect. Business travel has declined amid the pandemic. Image: Getty

“A lot of people said the overnight business trip to go win a deal or meet with a recruit or meet with your team is a thing of the past. I could not disagree with that more because I think that the competitive landscape today allows all of us to interact via Zoom. But the moment that a competitor of Walker & Dunlop travels to a city to meet with a client to win a financing or to sell a property and I have the opportunity to Zoom or get on an airplane and the competition has gotten on an airplane, I'm getting on an airplane and I’m booking that hotel room,” he said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live this week.

“So I think there is a disconnect right now where people say we're going to be in this operating environment indefinitely. I think it snaps back very, very, very much quicker than most people are projecting,” he said.

A ‘structural reduction’ in business travel?

To be sure, Walker’s opinion doesn’t necessarily reflect the consensus outlook for business travel. Business leaders across hospitality, travel, and tech have been vocal about the lasting shift they’re expecting in the space. “Whenever this [pandemic] is over, we will have practiced for more than one year how to interact across very, very big distances. So, we do expect a structural reduction of the business travel market,” trivago (TRVG) CEO Axel Hefer told Yahoo Finance Live in November.

In November, Microsoft (MSFT) founder and philanthropist Bill Gates predicted that over 50% of business travel will disappear forever. Earlier in the pandemic, he commented during a conversation on LinkedIn: “I doubt there will be that many face-to-face shareholder meetings. Now everybody’s got permission. Also the amount of innovation in the software that facilitates this thing, so you think...what does a virtual courtroom, a virtual legislature look like? And in some ways you can create something that’s more efficient and better than what was there before.”

146,2021-01-21T14:14:43+00:00,Tesla isn't the only auto stock exploding right now,"Tesla’s stock isn’t the only one in the auto space showing some electrified action to kick off 2021.

Somewhat under the proverbial radar, shares of General Motors and Ford are up 31% and 23%, respectively, year-to-date. Ford stock (F) was the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance’s platform Thursday despite a lack of fundamental new news, underscoring the growing interest by investors to own the name.

So what gives with the surprising bullishness on two stocks that have been in reverse these past five years amid confusing restructuring plans and waning demand for sedans? At long last, it appears Wall Street is finally recognizing the actions each automaker has taken to cut costs and shift to electric vehicle production and how each may shape profits in coming years.

“We believe a robust product cycle, favorable pricing environment for U.S. trucks, improved warranty performance, and restructuring savings could result in better-than-expected 2021 guidance, and prompt investors to anticipate a more aggressive turnaround trajectory,” Deutsche Bank auto analyst Emmanuel Rosner said about Ford in a note this week to clients. Rosner put Ford’s stock — still trading at a paltry forward price-to-earnings multiple of 9.5 times and relatively attractive 1.3% dividend yield — on his conviction buy list.

Rosner’s “robust product cycle” shout out on Ford is a nod to some key models coming to market soon, including the electric Mustang Mach-E (2021), the first electric F-150 (2022) and Bronco (2021). The analyst is also keen on the potential for a revamped cost-cutting plan under new CEO Jim Farley and strong truck prices as the economy recovers from the pandemic.

Considering Ford’s seemingly cheap valuation given these factors, it’s no wonder the stock has shifted into high gear especially with all the optimism on Tesla floating around trading desks.

Indeed, the tune is similar at General Motors (GM) at the moment.

“We believe the company could initiate better than expected 2021 guidance in the $6.00-$7.00 range vs. consensus $5.92, boosted by strong full-size truck pricing/volumes/mix, ongoing structural cost savings, and non-repeat of $1.2 billion Takata recall charge, partially offset by higher commodity prices and roll-off of COVID austerity measures. Moreover, we believe additional updates from GM on timeline of its EV rollout, and on its strategy for Cruise could help unlock additional value,” Rosner said, adding GM to his buy list as well.

Rowe Price on Tuesday, May 7, and said it included money from GM, Honda and Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)

Despite GM shares getting a boost this week following Microsoft’s fresh $2 billion investment in the automaker’s autonomous tech business Cruise (valuing Cruise at $30 billion, or 38% of GM’s market cap; chatter of a spin-off is likely to increase), the stock still looks cheap relatively speaking. GM’s stock trades at a mere 8.3 times estimated forward earnings and offers a 1.4% dividend yield.

Clearly, there appears to be more meat behind the momentum in Ford and GM and former President Donald Trump leaving the White House and no longer able to attack each company via Twitter. Whether that momentum could be sustained beyond the looming earnings season, only time will tell.

147,2021-01-21T11:00:17+00:00,Apple’s First Headset to Be Niche Precursor to Eventual AR Glasses,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s first crack at a headset is designed to be a pricey, niche precursor to a more ambitious augmented reality product that will take longer to develop, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The initial device has confronted several development hurdles and the company has conservative sales expectations, illustrating how challenging it will be to bring this nascent consumer technology to the masses.

As a mostly virtual reality device, it will display an all-encompassing 3-D digital environment for gaming, watching video and communicating. AR functionality, the ability to overlay images and information over a view of the real world, will be more limited. Apple has planned to launch the product as soon as 2022, going up against Facebook Inc.’s Oculus, Sony Corp.’s PlayStation VR and headsets from HTC Corp., the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing private plans.

Apple’s typical playbook involves taking emerging consumer technology, such as music players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, and making it reliable and easy to use for everyone. This time, though, Apple isn’t looking to create an iPhone-like hit for its first headset. Instead, the company is building a high-end, niche product that will prepare outside developers and consumers for its eventual, more mainstream AR glasses.

The plans suggest that Apple’s first headset will be far more expensive than those from rivals, which cost about $300 to $900. Some Apple insiders believe the company may sell only one headset per day per retail store. Apple has roughly 500 stores, so in that scenario, annual sales would be just over 180,000 units — excluding other sales channels. That would put it on par with other pricey Apple products, such as the $5,999 Mac Pro desktop computer. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.

Apple is aiming to include some of its most advanced and powerful chips in the headset along with displays that are much higher-resolution than those in existing VR products. Some of the chips tested in the device beat the performance of Apple’s M1 Mac processors. The company has also designed the headset with a fan, something the company usually tries to avoid on mobile products, the people said.

Story continues

The headset, codenamed N301, is in a late prototype stage, but is not yet finalized so the company’s plans could change or be scrapped entirely before launch. The AR glasses, codenamed N421, are in an early stage known as “architecture,” meaning Apple is still working on underlying technologies. This product is several years away, according to the people, though Apple has previously targeted as early as 2023 to unveil it.

The powerful processors and the inclusion of a fan initially led to a device that was too large and heavy with some concern about neck strain in early testing. Apple removed the space VR gadgets usually reserve for users who need to wear eyeglasses, which brought the headset closer to the face and helped shrink the size. And to address consumers with poorer eyesight, it developed a system where custom prescription lenses can be inserted into the headset over the VR screens, the people said.

This may expose Apple to regulations governing the sale of products with prescriptions. The company typically sells its devices in dozens of countries, many of which have different prescription rules. Apple is also discussing how it would implement prescriptions at the point of sale online and in retail stores.

Apple originally planned to include less powerful processors and offload much of the work to a hub in a user’s home that would wirelessly beam content to the headset. But that idea was squashed by Jony Ive, Apple’s design chief at the time, Bloomberg News reported last year. The headset is designed to work as a standalone device, meaning it can operate on a battery rather than be plugged into a wall or a Mac. That’s similar to Facebook’s latest VR product, while Sony’s requires a PlayStation gaming console.

To further reduce the device’s weight, Apple is planning to use a fabric exterior. That’s a departure from the metal designs Apple uses for most products, though it has used plastic for devices like AirPods, that need to be light, and fabrics for the HomePod speaker to improve acoustics.

Prototypes of the headset, some of which are about the size of an Oculus Quest, include external cameras to enable some AR features. The company is testing using the cameras for hand-tracking and is working on a feature where a user can type virtually in the air to input text. It’s unclear if that function will be ready for the first version of the device or if it will ever leave the exploratory stage.

The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted some development with Apple hardware engineers only being able to work on certain days from the office. The company has also faced delays conducting user testing and data collection. That has slowed some decisions in the engineering process.

The company is also still grappling with what content and functionality it intends to ship with the device. Virtual reality is still a somewhat nascent technology, with content beyond games still relatively limited. Last year, Apple acquired a company called NextVR, which recorded events such as concerts and sports games in virtual reality. It’s also discussed bundling an App Store with the device, which runs on an operating system dubbed “rOS” inside the company.

If Apple goes ahead with the VR headset, it would be a precursor to an eventual pair of AR glasses — a product that the company sees as far more mainstream but also more difficult to launch. Microsoft Corp.’s HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap’s headset, which emphasize AR over VR, retail for $3,500 and $2,295 respectively. HoloLens mostly focuses on work use cases still, while Magic Leap fell well short of the early hype and slashed jobs last year.

Apple first added AR to the iPhone in 2017, allowing new mobile games and apps like those for virtually placing furniture in your living room before buying it. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said both virtual and augmented reality have potential, but that AR is the larger opportunity.

AR glasses must be packed with small, powerful and efficient electronics to overlay notifications, map directions and other information while supporting internet connectivity and strong battery life. That’s a huge technical challenge. Even Oculus, which released its first all-in-one VR headset in 2019, won’t include AR features in its first glasses this year.

Getting to that point requires years of work on lenses, hardware and software, component miniaturization, production techniques and content creation. Critically, getting most people to wear a computer on their face, even a small one, is difficult. That, in part, doomed Google’s early attempt at consumer AR glasses several years ago.

By developing a less mainstream initial headset, Apple can invest in the underlying technologies, consumer education, content development and developer relations to give its eventual AR glasses the best opportunity to be successful — when they are ready.

152,2021-01-20T01:10:59+00:00,Suspected Russian Hackers Targeted Cyber Firm Malwarebytes,"(Bloomberg) -- Suspected Russian hackers targeted the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes Inc. in the course of a sprawling cyber-attack that breached U.S. government agencies and companies.

The attacker abused “applications with privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments,” according to a Tuesday blog post by Chief Executive Officer Marcin Kleczynski. He said the attack was part of the same hacking campaign that has utilized infected software from SolarWinds Corp. to target other organizations.

“After an extensive investigation, we determined the attacker only gained access to a limited subset of internal company emails. We found no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise in any of our internal on-premises and production environments,” Kleczynski wrote.

U.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI have said the recent hacking campaign -- which was found and disclosed by the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. in December -- was likely undertaken by Russia. In many instances, attackers broke into systems through a compromised version of widely used software from Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.

However, analysts have said that SolarWinds’s software wasn’t the only method the suspected Russian hackers used to breach networks. On Tuesday, the firm Symantec discovered a new form of malware used in the attack that wasn’t delivered through SolarWinds, suggesting the hack could be broader than previously understood. The firm CrowdStrike Inc. said the hackers had attempted to break into their networks by compromising a third-party vendor that resells Microsoft services. If a reseller is breached and has access to a client’s credentials, the attacker could then hack into the client’s networks.

On Dec. 15, Microsoft alerted Malwarebytes about “suspicious activity from a third-party application” that was consistent with the behaviors of the hackers that had exploited SolarWinds. Upon investigation, Malwarebytes found “no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise in any of our internal on-premises and production environments,” he wrote.

Story continues

Jeff Jones, a Microsoft representative, said in a statement, “Our ongoing investigation of recent attacks has found this advanced and sophisticated threat actor had several techniques in their toolkit. We have not identified any vulnerabilities in our products or cloud services.”

Malwarebytes’s disclosure is the latest example of the attackers targeting security companies in the course of the hacking campaign. They stole tools from FireEye and attempted to breach CrowdStrike, the companies said last month.

“These attackers were clearly sophisticated and primarily targeted federal agencies and security companies, as far as I’m aware,” Kleczynski said in an email to Bloomberg News.

FireEye’s investigation into its own breach last month revealed that the hackers had installed malicious code into SolarWinds’s Orion software, which is used by government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The malicious code, which customers received by updating the software, provided a launching pad of sorts for further attacks by the hackers into computer networks.

According to SolarWinds, as many as 18,000 of its customers may have received infected updates, though the hackers are believed to have conducted further intrusions in far fewer of them. Malwarebytes isn’t a SolarWinds customer.

153,2021-01-19T17:40:13+00:00,Microsoft bets on GM’s Cruise while Amazon and others back Rivian amid electric vehicle boom,"It’s another big day in the EV (electric vehicle) and AV (autonomous vehicle) space.

General Motors (GM) announced Tuesday it has entered into a “long-term strategic relationship” with Microsoft (MSFT) focused on GM’s autonomous tech division, Cruise.

Included in the deal is new funding, in which Microsoft will join GM, Honda (HMC) and other institutional investors in a combined new equity raise of more than $2 billion in Cruise, pushing its valuation to $30 billion.

Not to be outdone, electric truckmaker Rivian announced it has raised $2.65 billion from an investor group led by asset managers T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Amazon, through its Climate Pledge Fund. The New York Times and Bloomberg estimate Rivian’s new fundraise values the company at over $27 billion. Ford (F) is also a partner and investor in Rivian.

For the automakers, it makes more and more sense to partner with big technology companies. “Microsoft, as the gold standard in the trustworthy democratization of technology, will be a force multiplier for us as we commercialize our fleet of self-driving, all-electric, shared vehicles,"" Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a statement. DETROIT, MICHIGAN, UNITED STATES - 2019/07/31: People admire a GM Cruise self-driving car on display at the General Motors world headquarters building in Detroit's Renaissance Center. (Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

“As Cruise and GM's preferred cloud, we will apply the power of Azure to help them scale and make autonomous transportation mainstream,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, underscoring Ammann’s sentiments.

For companies like Rivian, that straddle the space between tech and autos, raising money and securing technology partners is a necessary precondition for success. As is competing with the big first mover in the space — Tesla (TSLA).

“The process of creating something like this is anything but simple,” Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe said in an interview with the New York Times. “It’s a complex orchestra, several thousand parts coming from several hundred suppliers. It’s definitely far more complex than people think and far more complex than I thought it would be.”

An electric & autonomous arms race

Story continues

Prior to today’s deal, Cruise was worth around $18 billion on paper based on its last fundraise. Many analysts on Wall Street and investors surmised GM’s Cruise division was worth a lot more, and today’s announcement is something of a validation. Before Tuesday’s deal, GM owned slightly more than 80% of Cruise, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

Indeed, GM shares soared to a new high last week, and another new high today, based on the company’s push to electrify its vehicles, services, and component infrastructure (batteries, drivetrains, etc.).

A big factor in a lot of these big stock movements, and even bigger valuations, is Tesla. “The massive ramp of Tesla stock and overall valuation is an undeniable factor here,” iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer tells Yahoo Finance. NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES - 2019/04/17: Rivian R1T seen at the New York International Auto Show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York. (Photo by Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

Rivian, which is private, has been a darling of the VC community and automotive press, as its highly anticipated electric pickup and SUV near production. The company has taken a more measured approach to fundraising and promoting its products, quietly seeking investment (and not through a public offering or uber-popular SPAC merger) and rolling out updates on its vehicles when there’s something concrete to show.

“We want to launch, demonstrate our capability and let our performance speak for itself before we can look into being public,” Scaringe said.

Though Cruise is a pure AV play and integrated into GM’s EV plans, Rivian also is working on AV tech as well (like Tesla).

The big question is whether upstarts like Rivian, and even established automakers like GM and Ford, can effectively compete with Tesla.

“I think there is a sense that if you're not Tesla, you have to make up for some lost time, and time is money,” Brauer says. “There’s a big investment coming to a lot of these Tesla competitors in order to catch up, to be a player in the space.”

154,2021-01-18T10:25:52+00:00,15 Most Popular Instant Messaging Apps,"In this article we are going to list the 15 most popular instant messaging apps. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 most popular instant messaging apps. I am sure many of the people who are reading this article remember the days of MSN Messenger, which was the first popular instant messaging app used across the world. The messenger service was established in 1999, and for the next decade or so, was by far the best means of communication for everyone. I was 12 when I started using it, and I remember the painstakingly created usernames which we all cringe at now, but just how fun it was to come home from school and later be in contact with each other through messenger. Of course, all of this was before the advent of mobile phones and especially smart mobile phones. And even when phones were invented, at least in my country, the text and calling packages were quite expensive because of which we preferred MSN Messenger, which later became Messenger Live.

I'm sure many of you also remember signing out and then singing back in again, just to send a notification across to your chat list and attracting the attention of specific people. Most of us remember those times with fond nostalgia because they were as simple as simple could be. The service finally came to an end in 2013, and reached a peak in 2009, when there were 330 million active users, or more than the population of the United States. The closest competition the services had in those years was Yahoo! Messenger, operated by Yahoo! and was quite popular too, but also does not exist anymore.

The difference between that time and now is the development of technology to the extent that it has become quite cheap. While at the time even basic cell phones were quite expensive, now most smart phones are cheap enough up to the fact that 2.7 billion people use smartphones across the world, which is why apps have now become the biggest thing rather than desktop messenger services. New apps have been developed over the past decade or so which make MSN's usage number look quaint. Imagine 2 billion people using the same instant messaging. The numbers are absolutely mind boggling, showing us the widespread usage of instant messaging services, as people can instantly connect up with friends and family, even as the world becomes more globalized. Living in a developing country, it was quite rare for people to move abroad in the previous decades but now, many more people move than they used to and keeping in touch with them or in contact with them has never been easier as well. This is perhaps the biggest reason why the most popular instant messaging apps are such a hit, due to the growing market. But of course, it's not just about keeping in touch with those who don't live near you. It is much easier to use a free service to text, call or video call a person and the free part is why these things are so incredibly popular.

The odds are extremely high that most of the people reading this article also have an account on WhatsApp. I've had one for around 8-9 years and nearly everyone I know, old or young, is on it as well. The app has obtained massive popularity and was acquired by Facebook in 2014, due to the aforementioned popularity and massive user base. However, the company has been in hot waters recently as it revealed a new privacy policy, which attracted huge controversy. The privacy policy was announced in December 2020 and people were told if they did not accept it by February 8, they would lose access to WhatsApp. The privacy policy also gave WhatsApp permission to share more information with Facebook, which was the part which attracted disdain and condemnation from everyone. This even led to Elon Musk, founder of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Space X, and the second richest person in the world right now, to tweet his support for moving away from WhatsApp and onto Signal, which is said to be more safer in terms of data and privacy. This of course led to millions of followers changing their services and investing in Signal, boosting its stock by 6,350% in just three days. Unfortunately, and this is an indictment of how brainlessly people follow their favorite celebrities without even verifying the basic facts first, this was the wrong company, as the actual messaging app Signal is owned by a non-profit organization and doesn't even have shares to trade.

However, in a show of the power of people, this time in the correct sense, the absolute outrage that occurred over this new privacy policy led to WhatsApp being on the back foot, starting initially with its biggest market which is India. India has 340 million WhatsApp users and to ensure that the number doesn't plunge, WhatsApp took out full sized ads in major newspapers in the country to calm down users and counter the rumors that were spreading like wildfire. However, this strategy had limited success and most people were still on the fence, which finally resulted in WhatsApp actually delaying its policy now till May and confirming that people who didn't agree to the new policy by February 8 would not have their accounts deleted. What will happen now remains to be seen, but the fact that such a major corporation was forced to trackback shows that if united, people can achieve amazing things. Sadly, too often this outrage is focused on a loss of convenience only.

WhatsApp is not the only instant messaging app which has a lot of users. There are several others with hundreds of millions of users and have been at the top for many years. To determine our list, we initially considered the research done by Data Reportal, which shows statistics for the most used social media apps. Where the numbers weren't mentioned in the Data Reportal statistics, we searched separately for their active monthly users and finalize our list. So without further ado, let's take a look at the apps that are more than likely to be on your phone right now, starting with number 15:

7. Skype

Skype was the first globally popular and accessible free video calling service which was established by Microsoft and has more than 300 million on a monthly basis.

6. Telegram

155,2021-01-18T10:25:52+00:00,15 Most Popular Instant Messaging Apps,"In this article we are going to list the 15 most popular instant messaging apps. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 most popular instant messaging apps. I am sure many of the people who are reading this article remember the days of MSN Messenger, which was the first popular instant messaging app used across the world. The messenger service was established in 1999, and for the next decade or so, was by far the best means of communication for everyone. I was 12 when I started using it, and I remember the painstakingly created usernames which we all cringe at now, but just how fun it was to come home from school and later be in contact with each other through messenger. Of course, all of this was before the advent of mobile phones and especially smart mobile phones. And even when phones were invented, at least in my country, the text and calling packages were quite expensive because of which we preferred MSN Messenger, which later became Messenger Live.

I'm sure many of you also remember signing out and then singing back in again, just to send a notification across to your chat list and attracting the attention of specific people. Most of us remember those times with fond nostalgia because they were as simple as simple could be. The service finally came to an end in 2013, and reached a peak in 2009, when there were 330 million active users, or more than the population of the United States. The closest competition the services had in those years was Yahoo! Messenger, operated by Yahoo! and was quite popular too, but also does not exist anymore.

The difference between that time and now is the development of technology to the extent that it has become quite cheap. While at the time even basic cell phones were quite expensive, now most smart phones are cheap enough up to the fact that 2.7 billion people use smartphones across the world, which is why apps have now become the biggest thing rather than desktop messenger services. New apps have been developed over the past decade or so which make MSN's usage number look quaint. Imagine 2 billion people using the same instant messaging. The numbers are absolutely mind boggling, showing us the widespread usage of instant messaging services, as people can instantly connect up with friends and family, even as the world becomes more globalized. Living in a developing country, it was quite rare for people to move abroad in the previous decades but now, many more people move than they used to and keeping in touch with them or in contact with them has never been easier as well. This is perhaps the biggest reason why the most popular instant messaging apps are such a hit, due to the growing market. But of course, it's not just about keeping in touch with those who don't live near you. It is much easier to use a free service to text, call or video call a person and the free part is why these things are so incredibly popular.

The odds are extremely high that most of the people reading this article also have an account on WhatsApp. I've had one for around 8-9 years and nearly everyone I know, old or young, is on it as well. The app has obtained massive popularity and was acquired by Facebook in 2014, due to the aforementioned popularity and massive user base. However, the company has been in hot waters recently as it revealed a new privacy policy, which attracted huge controversy. The privacy policy was announced in December 2020 and people were told if they did not accept it by February 8, they would lose access to WhatsApp. The privacy policy also gave WhatsApp permission to share more information with Facebook, which was the part which attracted disdain and condemnation from everyone. This even led to Elon Musk, founder of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Space X, and the second richest person in the world right now, to tweet his support for moving away from WhatsApp and onto Signal, which is said to be more safer in terms of data and privacy. This of course led to millions of followers changing their services and investing in Signal, boosting its stock by 6,350% in just three days. Unfortunately, and this is an indictment of how brainlessly people follow their favorite celebrities without even verifying the basic facts first, this was the wrong company, as the actual messaging app Signal is owned by a non-profit organization and doesn't even have shares to trade.

However, in a show of the power of people, this time in the correct sense, the absolute outrage that occurred over this new privacy policy led to WhatsApp being on the back foot, starting initially with its biggest market which is India. India has 340 million WhatsApp users and to ensure that the number doesn't plunge, WhatsApp took out full sized ads in major newspapers in the country to calm down users and counter the rumors that were spreading like wildfire. However, this strategy had limited success and most people were still on the fence, which finally resulted in WhatsApp actually delaying its policy now till May and confirming that people who didn't agree to the new policy by February 8 would not have their accounts deleted. What will happen now remains to be seen, but the fact that such a major corporation was forced to trackback shows that if united, people can achieve amazing things. Sadly, too often this outrage is focused on a loss of convenience only.

WhatsApp is not the only instant messaging app which has a lot of users. There are several others with hundreds of millions of users and have been at the top for many years. To determine our list, we initially considered the research done by Data Reportal, which shows statistics for the most used social media apps. Where the numbers weren't mentioned in the Data Reportal statistics, we searched separately for their active monthly users and finalize our list. So without further ado, let's take a look at the apps that are more than likely to be on your phone right now, starting with number 15:

15. Discord

Total number of active monthly users in 2020 (in millions of people): 6.7

7. Skype

Total number of active monthly users in 2020 (in millions of people): 300

Skype was the first globally popular and accessible free video calling service which was established by Microsoft and has more than 300 million on a monthly basis. However, the hype behind Skype has decreased now that you can video call through Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, and newcomers like Zoom have also taken away market share. Skype 6.0 Login Screen

6. Telegram

Total number of active monthly users in 2020 (in millions of people): 400

Telegram is another app many people are touting to replace WhatsApp and the app, which has 400 million active users would definitely welcome the added numbers.

156,2021-01-14T23:44:25+00:00,Why Nvidia Is My “Slam Dunk” Investment For The Decade,"What was the most important financial event of 2020? Most folks would tell you it was the coronavirus pandemic and the economic devastation caused by government lockdowns.

But that’s wrong. For investors, the most life-changing thing that happened last year has to do with computer chips. In 2020, for the first time ever, the value of the computer chip industry surpassed that of the oil industry. The 30 largest semiconductor companies are now worth $2.5 trillion combined. Compare that to $1.7 trillion for the 30 largest oil firms.

This sent an important signal to investors. Oil is no longer the most important resource is the world. Computer chips are. Longtime RiskHedge readers know computer chips, also called semiconductors, are the “brains” of electronics.

There would be no iPhone, Amazon Webstore, or online messaging apps without them. Temperature sensors in air conditioners are powered by tiny microchips. Rice cookers cook rice to perfection because built-in semiconductors control the heat. The chip inside pacemakers sends electrical pulses to the heart to keep it beating regularly.

From flying across oceans to hailing a ride on our smartphones when we land, streaming movies to buying stuff online, checking out groceries to paying for dinner with your credit card: every modern system runs on chips.

You can’t grab a packet of microchips off the shelf at Walmart. But the latest cameras, TVs, washing machines, ovens, and refrigerators are all made “smart” by semis.

Last year, there were 300 billion computer chips sold. For perspective, we consumed roughly 34 billion barrels of oil last year. The five largest chip companies are now worth over $1.4 trillion combined. And chip stocks are ripping higher: Nvidia Slam Dunk

Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more

Semiconductors Are The Most Valuable Goods The World Has Ever Known

It took a staggering 498 people to prepare dinner for King Louis XIV. The French king was the richest of the rich, in the world’s wealthiest city at the time. What if I told you the average American today is “better off” than the 17th century king?

Story continues

You likely don’t have a personal tailor like Louis did. But you can buy all kinds of clothes on the internet and have them dropped on your front porch in a few days. Louis travelled in a golden carriage with a personal chauffeur. You can fly to hundreds of destinations the king never dreamed of visiting.

Modern life is made possible by semiconductors. As I said, without them the internet and smartphones wouldn’t exist. Even airplanes rely on computer chips these days. They control autopilot, monitor jet-engine performance, and even measure the aircraft’s temperature.

Semis Are Also “Fueling” Every Future Disruption

A few weeks back, I wrote about a disruptor called Butterfly Network (LGVW). Butterfly invented a “beard shaver” shaped instrument that transforms any smartphone into an ultrasound machine: Butterfly Network

Source: Butterfly Networks

How the heck did it achieve this act of “magic?” Traditional ultrasound machines use piezoelectric crystals, which turn electrical energy into vibrations in the form of ultrasonic waves. In short, this makes the machines bulky and expensive.

Butterfly’s world-class engineers reinvented how ultrasounds work and squeezed the technology onto a tiny chip. This is why their tech is called Ultrasound-on-Chip. Aeva (IPV) is achieving similar breakthroughs with self-driving cars. Aeva is one of the world’s top LIDAR companies.

LIDAR sensors that resemble a lawn sprinkler are affixed to the roof and front grill of the self-driving car. These sensors then send out roughly 160,000 pulses per second in all directions. And they can detect the smallest detail, like a leaf blowing in the wind. Aeva shrank the size of its sensor by 1,000X by bolting all the functions onto a semiconductor: Lidar

Source: Aeva

This helped Aeva slash the cost of a LIDAR sensor to roughly $500. That’s far cheaper than the tens of thousands of dollars you’d pay for the current top-of-the-range sensors.

Self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, computer vision, space tourism, and genomic medicine need faster chips. Semiconductor sales have only gone one way our entire lives: UP.

Chip companies are expected to rake in a record $470 billion this year. And all these future disruptions will likely push that well above $1 trillion. Nvidia Slam Dunk

Here's My ""Slam Dunk"" Investment For The 2020s: Nvidia

A good exercise when sizing up a stock is to ask, “Could the world survive without this company?” The answer for the vast majority of firms is “Yes, we’d do just fine.” But if we woke up tomorrow to find NVIDIA (NVDA) had disappeared, the world would be a much worse place.

NVIDIA pioneered a new type of chip called graphics processing units (GPUs) back in the 1990s. GPUs were specifically made to improve video game graphics. But the disruptor achieved a major milestone in 2020. For the first time, artificial intelligence-related sales were its largest business. In the last three quarters, its AI business raked in $4.8 billion.

NVIDIA Is The ""Brains"" Behind The Most Important AI Projects

It powers several robocar startups, including Zoox and Google’s Waymo. Amazon and Microsoft’s giant data centers are also packed full of NVIDIA GPUs. Medical imaging disruptor Paige is using computer vision to revolutionize the way we diagnose cancer. Using a dozen NVIDIA GPUs, it trained a machine to detect early signs of tumors.

I first recommended NVIDIA back in 2018. As I said at the time, if I could buy only one stock for the next five years, NVIDIA would be it. The stock has doubled since then, and it’s headed much higher in the coming years. That’s why it’s a current buy in my Disruption Investor advisory.

Last year, NVIDIA took the mantle of “America’s largest chipmaker” from Intel for the first time ever. This kicks off a new era, and my research suggests it will be one of world’s 10 largest companies by 2025. Investing in leading chipmakers like NVIDIA is the surest way to make money over the next decade.

Naver Corp. and Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund, both existing investors, are also close to signing an agreement for additional funding, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Bukalapak has pulled in $100 million from Microsoft Corp., GIC Pte and PT Elang Mahkota Teknologi as part of the ongoing round, Bloomberg News reported in November.

Representatives of Standard Chartered, Bukalapak, Naver and Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund declined to comment.

Standard Chartered and Bukalapak said on Thursday they formed a strategic partnership to collaborate on digital banking. The online marketplace, which competes with rivals such as Shopee, Tokopedia and Lazada, has about 100 million users and 13.5 million sellers in Indonesia. It is valued at $3.5 billion, according to CB Insights.

The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for e-commerce in the world’s fourth most-populous country, where the median age is 30 years. Lockdowns prompted many consumers to try mobile shopping for the first time, and Bukalapak said its transaction volumes more than doubled in 2020 from a year earlier.

There has been a flurry of deals among Southeast Asia’s biggest internet companies in recent weeks.

Singapore’s Sea Ltd., the region’s most valuable company, acquired Indonesia’s PT Bank Kesejahteraan Ekonomi, Bloomberg News reported this week. Gojek, Indonesia’s most valuable startup, has amassed a 22.16% stake in PT Bank Jago, while Grab Financial Group, the financial services unit of Grab Holdings Inc., raised $300 million, led by Hanwha Asset Management Co.

158,2021-01-13T15:59:08+00:00,"Ubisoft to Make Star Wars Game, Marking End to EA Exclusivity","(Bloomberg) -- Ubisoft Entertainment SA said it will develop a new Star Wars game, indicating a longtime exclusivity agreement for Electronic Arts Inc. on the Walt Disney Co. franchise will come to an end.

The new Star Wars title is set to be the first not published by EA since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. The news sent shares of the two game companies diverging Wednesday. Ubisoft climbed more than 7%, and EA fell as much 3.2%.

The agreement with EA is scheduled to expire in 2023. In an emailed statement, EA said: “We’re proud of our long-standing collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, which will continue for years to come.” Lucasfilm said in a blog post Wednesday morning that it had “a number of projects underway” with EA. A representative for Ubisoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ubisoft said only that its game will be set in an open-world environment and will developed by the company’s Massive Entertainment team in Sweden, best known for a series of shooting games called Tom Clancy’s The Division. The group is also working on a game based on James Cameron’s “Avatar” movies.

EA struck the exclusivity deal in 2013, following the closure of the long-running development studio LucasArts. It gave EA the rights to publish all games based on the license, expect those on nontraditional gaming platforms such as on phones or Facebook.

Star Wars fans have complained that EA wasn’t doing the franchise justice. The publisher released four Star Wars games and canceled at least three others. With the exclusivity arrangement set to end in about two years, Disney is signaling it’s already preparing for life after EA.

Earlier this week, Lucasfilm said a new Indiana Jones video game is underway at Bethesda Softworks LLC, which agreed to sell itself last year to Microsoft Corp. for $7.5 billion.

The company said it had been alerted to the attack by investigators at Microsoft and that ""a sophisticated threat actor"" had compromised the certificate used to guard connections between its products and Microsoft's cloud services.

In a four-paragraph statement, the company said around 10% of its more than 36,000 customers had been affected, but it believed ""a low single digit number"" of users had been specifically targeted.

Mimecast spokeswoman Laura Barnes declined further comment. ""Our investigation is ongoing and we don't have anything additional to share at this time,"" she said.

Mimecast provides a range of email security products, such as systems to block malicious web links, phishing attempts and attackers using fake identities in order to trick their victims into revealing sensitive information.

Three cybersecurity investigators, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of an ongoing probe, told Reuters they suspected the hackers who compromised Mimecast were the same group that broke into U.S. software maker SolarWinds and a host of sensitive U.S. government agencies.

The SolarWinds hack was disclosed last month and is one of the most ambitious cyber-espionage campaigns ever uncovered. U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed Russia, which has repeatedly denied the allegations.

162,2021-01-12T11:00:00+00:00,"IBM Leads in Quantum Computing, Ford in Driverless Car Patents","(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence, quantum computers and autonomous vehicles are among the fastest-growing areas of technology, with American companies often in the lead, according to a new study of U.S. patents issued over the past five years.International Business Machines Corp. received the most patents in machine learning and quantum computers, while Ford Motor Co. is the most active in areas of vehicle navigation and control systems, according to the analysis by Fairview Research’s IFI Claims Patent Services.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued 352,013 patents last year, a 1% decrease that’s likely attributable to work-flow changes because of the coronavirus pandemic, said IFIClaims Chief Executive Mike Baycroft. IBM topped the list of patent recipients for the 28th year with 9,130 patents, while Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea was second with 6,415 new patents issued last year.Of the top-10 fastest growing fields, IBM also was No. 1 in areas of quantum computers, machine learning and computer systems using neural networks that imitate how the human brain works. Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. also ranked in the top five of those three areas.

“We are focused on areas where we think it will keep IBM competitive in the future,” said Kathryn Guarini, chief operating officer of IBM Research. “We see cloud, AI and quantum as the trifecta of technologies for the IT industry.”

The company, based in Armonk, New York, has integrated artificial intelligence into all areas of its business, she said. One of its new patents is for ways AI can understand conversational tones, such as when a person contacts customer service. It’s just one example that backs up a Brookings Institution report that AI is likely to transform white collar and higher paid jobs.

“It’s never our intent to replace the human,” Guarini said. “Our hope and our intent is that it makes all of us more efficient and improves productivity.”

Quantum computers, which use the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can’t handle, could create new ways for drug and agriculture companies to discover new compounds and financial service companies to improve encryption.

With the classical computers, “we’ve made tremendous progress, making it more efficient and secure,” Guarini said. “But there has not been a revolution in how the technology works, for decades and decades. Quantum is on a whole new level.”

Other fast-growing areas include display technology, with Samsung Display Co. in the lead; data transfer technology in computer design led by Intel Corp. and China’s Huawei Technologies Co., and plant and seed development led by Bayer AG’s Monsanto.

In the two areas involving autonomous vehicles, Toyota Motor Corp. and LG Electronics Inc., were the next highest recipients behind Ford.

The second-fastest growth area, albeit with a small number of overall patents, was in the area of electrical smoking devices with Philip Morris International Inc. as the top recipient over the past five years.

“Patents are a significant mechanism for companies to develop intellectual property assets,” Baycroft said. “This is how you compete in the global market.”

RATING RATIONALE

The acquisitions will add scale and diversification to Planview's revenue base, increasing Planview's exposure to customers outside of the company's traditional large, enterprise customer base. This should provide Planview cross sell opportunities for its existing project and portfolio management (PPM) products. Given Planview's existing scale, the company should be able to improve the cost structures of the two target companies, achieving cost synergies and increasing EBITDA.

Story continues

Still, integration execution risks are material, since the acquisitions will increase Planview's revenue base by more than one-third and will expand Planview into a new business segment, which is part of one of the target companies. The high proforma leverage, which exceeds 9x adjusted debt to EBITDA prior to anticipated cost synergies, magnifies the negative impact of any integration missteps that Planview may encounter.

The B3 CFR reflects financial leverage, which Moody's expects will remain over 7.5x debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) over the near term, is very high given the execution risks integrating the acquisitions. Also weighing on the credit profile is Planview's small scale, with proforma annual revenues of less than $400 million, and the relatively discretionary nature of Planview's products compared to other enterprise software, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Although the project and portfolio management (PPM) industry is fragmented, with many niche competitors, the industry also includes large, diversified competitors, including Broadcom, Micro Focus, Atlassian, and Microsoft, which have greater financial resources and more diverse product lines than Planview. Product concentration results from the small revenue base, with project and portfolio management (PPM) products accounting for over three quarters of revenues, exposing Planview to revenue volatility should customer product preferences shift.

Given the private equity ownership, Moody's anticipates that debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) will remain high, varying between 6x and 8x over the intermediate term, due to debt funded acquisitions or equity distributions following periods of deleveraging. The company's financial policies are a key corporate governance consideration under Moody's ESG framework.

Still, Planview benefits from a large base of recurring revenues, accounting for about 85% of revenues, and low capital intensity, which results in consistent free cash flow (FCF) generation. Further contributing to stability, revenues are diversified by industry and customer, with the top 10 customers accounting for less than 9% of revenues. Moody's believes that Planview holds a strong niche market position in the PPM market, which indicates market acceptance of Planview's product line and supports solid EBITDA margins. Moreover, increasingly complex workflows at large, diversified companies should provide an ongoing secular driver to Planview's Portfolio Management and Work Management products, supporting revenue growth over the intermediate to long term.

Planview's liquidity is good. Moody's expects Planview to generate annualized FCF at least $40 million over the next 12-18 months. Moody's expects that Planview will maintain at least $25 million of balance sheet cash and for the Senior Secured First Lien Revolver (""Revolver""), which is being upsized to $75 million from $65 million, to remain undrawn. Although there are no financial covenants governing the debt, the Revolver is subject to a usage based financial covenant, a first lien net leverage ratio (as defined), when utilization of the Revolver exceeds 35%. Moody's expects that Planview will maintain a substantial cushion on the first lien net leverage covenant at least over the near term.

The stable rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Planview's revenues will grow organically in the low to mid-single digit range over the near term driven by end market demand across its portfolio of Portfolio Management and Work Management software. Moody's expects margins will gradually improve over the next 12 to 18 months, reflecting revenue growth and the capture of cost synergies, such that the EBITDA margin will improve toward 38% (Moody's adjusted) and debt to EBITDA will decline toward the upper 7x range (Moody's adjusted). Given the strong translation of EBITDA into FCF, Moody's anticipates that FCF to debt will approach the mid-single digits percent level (Moody's adjusted).

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

Given the integration execution risks and high financial leverage, an upgrade is unlikely in the near term. Over the intermediate term, Moody's could upgrade Planview's ratings if the company successfully integrates the two acquisitions, capturing the anticipated annual cost synergies. Planview should also profitably grow, with organic revenue growth sustained at least in the upper single digits percent level and EBITDA margins increasing toward 40% (Moody's adjusted). Moody's would expect that Planview would follow a financial policy balancing the interests of creditors and shareholders, maintaining leverage below 6.5x debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) and FCF to debt (Moody's adjusted) above 5%.

Moody's could downgrade Planview's ratings if competitive or execution challenges result in revenue and EBITDA declining such that Moody's adjusted leverage is sustained above 8x debt to EBITDA and FCF to debt (Moody's adjusted) fails to achieve at least the low-single digits percent level.

The First Lien Facilities (Revolver, Term Loan, and the Delayed Draw Term Loan) are rated B2, one notch above the CFR, given their senior position in the capital structure, with a first lien on all assets, and loss absorption provided by the second lien debt. The Second Lien Facilities are rated Caa2, reflecting their effective subordination to the first lien debt.

Planview, headquartered in Austin, Texas is a provider of portfolio management and work management software across a broad set of enterprise customers. Planview will be owned by funds affiliated with private equity sponsors TPG, TA, and Thoma Bravo.

Global Credit Research - 08 Jan 2021

New York, January 08, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") affirmed Planview Parent, Inc.'s (""Planview"") ratings, including the B3 Corporate Family Rating (CFR), the B3-PD Probability of Default Rating (PDR), the B2 Senior Secured First Lien Credit Facilities (""First Lien Facilities""), and the Caa2 Senior Secured Second Lien Credit Facilities (""Second Lien Facilities""). The outlook is stable.

Planview intends to use the net proceeds of incremental term loans under the First Lien Facilities (including the $125 million Delayed Draw Term Loan) and the Second Lien Facilities, and cash equity from the company's sponsors to fund the acquisitions of two companies. Sponsor cash equity will fund about 27% of the purchase price for the two acquisitions.

Pro forma for the two acquisitions, debt to EBITDA will be over 9x (latest twelve months September 30, 2020 and including adjustments to exclude purchase accounting effects, add back certain non-recurring costs, Moody's adjusted) or just under 8x (including anticipated annual cost synergies).

Given Planview's existing scale, the company should be able to improve the cost structures of the two target companies, achieving cost synergies and increasing EBITDA.

165,2021-01-09T18:45:40+00:00,"Short Selling Legend Jim Chanos’ Top 10 Stock Picks and Tesla, IBM Comments","In this article, we presented short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks. Click to skip ahead and see Short Selling Legend Jim Chanos' Top 5 Stock Picks.

Short selling is a tough business. The upside is 100% at most whereas the downside is infinite. Jim Chanos is among the most successful and longest lasting short sellers in the world. He launched his fund in 1985. According to Institutional Investor between 1985 and 2017, Chanos' short stock portfolio lost 0.7% annually. That means if you invested $1 million in Chanos' short portfolio in 1985 (keep in mind that Chanos is one of the most successful short sellers ever), your investment would have shrank to $725 thousand by the end of 2017. So, how is this an accomplishment? Why is Jim Chanos considered to be so successful? How did he become a billionaire by losing money shorting stocks?

The answer is relative performance. A short seller is successful if his short stock picks return less than the market. If the S&P 500 Index returns 15% in one year and a short seller's stock picks gain 10%, professional investors still consider this short seller ""successful"" even though he loses 10% of this capital. Why? Because short sellers don't just short sell. That's what Chanos did. His Kynikos Capital Partners is actually 190% long and 90% short. His net market exposure is really around 100%. Even though Chanos lost 0.7% annually on the short side of his portfolio, these short positions allowed him to lever up on the long side of his portfolio. Overall, Kynikos Capital Partners returned 28.6% annually between 1985 and 2017, thanks to its 190% long exposure which was enabled by its 90% short exposure.

Labeled as one of Wall Street's best-known stock pickers on the short side, Kynikos Founder and President, Jim Chanos sees a 'Golden Age of Fraud' in the speculative market. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said, ""They begin to believe things that are too good to be true,"" talking about the willingness of the public to 'buy' even if there is evidence of fraud laid out.

Story continues Jim Chanos puppeteer

Aside from being Kynikos' Founder and President, Jim S. Chanos is an American Investment Manager and a Certified Investment advisor who is an expert in short selling and specializes in looking for legal frauds. Kynikos Associates on the other hand is an investment advisory firm that he founded in 1985.

""The longer a bull market goes, the more sense of disbelief erodes"". Chanos, like the other investors, assumed that 2020 will be a write-off. It certainly is easier to find good shorts in 2020 but for him, they're just not working. He said that there are companies that have large problems and are 'mind-numbingly' expensive but the market just 'does not' care about the facts. According to Jim Chanos, the 'zero-interest-rate' made it worse for the short sellers to make a profit. But he warned the bullish investors to not feel so 'relaxed' about the Fed's effort to help raise the economy. ""That's a very dangerous sort of place to be because you're completely counting on the Government to always make a you whole.""

Jim's short portfolio is intended to serve as an insurance policy for clients who want to hedge their own long positions. ""They're looking at the Fed as their insurance policy, not the marketplace. People are quite interested in fundamental shorts but then they shrug their shoulders and say, 'I don't really need it because the Government got my back"". For him, this kind of thinking is a very dangerous assumption for market participants to have.

""Normally, we're right about 2/3 of our positions and sometimes as high as 70% and I would say that the opposite has happened now."" He shared that just recently, they've been right on about 1/3 of their positions and wrong on the 2/3. For Chanos, the valuations in 2021 or even in 2022 would make no sense if we will value these businesses based on where they were in 2019.

According to Jim, there are people who believe in non-sense things for a very long time and he 'emphasized' that you must want to play with these people. ""You want to be in a marketplace and bet against people doing really dumb things with their money...Right now, people are doing dumb things with their money"". He marked that if you're playing properly, then you're going to come out ahead of other people.

Talking about tech stocks, Jim Chanos has nothing to say but purely positive reviews. He stated that a lot of bigger big cap tech stocks are 'pretty good' businesses. Jim Chanos mentioned Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as examples of tech stocks that get a very high return on capital and have high positive cash flow. He said that he would 'not' probably short some of those big tech names even if there's a possible regulation in place with the new administration.

""I think that the incoming administration is not going to be anti-market. I do think they probably will be tougher on bad actors in the market."" Jim Chanos thoroughly dubbed the current market environment as the ""Golden Age of Fraud"". He hopes that the new administration will toughen the cops on the beat and that will be a good thing for everyone.

Jim Chanos stated that the fraud cycle follows the financial cycle with a lag. People start to believe things that are too good to be true even if short-sellers and journalists are pointing out a fact pattern that would lead others to believe that there was a wholesale fraud going on. ""It's absolutely remarkable to me as to how many instances of outright fraud are sort of hiding in plain sight and investors continue to buy the shares of these companies because the companies themselves haven't admitted it yet."" He also said that these fraud companies 'outperform' the market until they admit their wrongdoing. ""That's one of the reasons why I think that risks in this market are much higher than people think."". For him, if people are willing to believe criminals until the criminals themselves admit the crime, then we have a very speculative market in place.  alert, attention, beware, black, careful, caution, clip, copy space, copyspace, crimes, cyber, danger, dangerous, defend, exclamation, fraud, guard, hacking, hanging, hazard, icon, identity, isolated, isolation, mark, message, nobody, objects, over white, overwhite, precaution, protect, rectangle, risk, safety, scam, sign, string, symbol, text, theft, triangle, vulnerable, warning, words, yellow

The prime example of legal fraud according to Jim Chanos is Enron, where everything they did was legal. ""It just depends on the magnitude of what the company is trying to pass off as legal under the accounting or regulatory rules."" He also mentioned that the recent poster child of fraud was Valeant Pharmaceuticals which went from $10 to $260 then back to $10 because it was able to convince investors that its earnings per share were $12 when in fact, they were actually losing money but still, everything they did was legal.

Jim Chanos marked that 30% of their portfolio is composed of companies they suspect to have legal or illegal frauds because they found something wrong with their financial statements. He explained that most shorts are caused by business model issues or business environment issues and not actual fraud. ""But now, we are actually seeing instances of fraud."" he proclaimed.

Speaking of Tech stocks, Tesla's EV is certainly the market leader right now but according to Jim Chanos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), 'also has a problem'. ""It's really a business model and valuation issue with Tesla."". Tesla is trading at half a trillion dollars at the time of the interview and it had a revenue of $30 billion but he said that there is something they do not want in their accounting. Despite what everyone says, Tesla will still be an automobile company that competes with other companies that make cars. Chanos said that 'Tesla is the stock where people pin their hopes and dreams'. ""For some holders, it's an EV company. For other holders its a clean energy company. For other holders it's an autonomous vehicle company... It's whatever people want to believe."" Jim then pointed out that, ""For the trailing 12 months, Tesla 'has not made' any money selling cars. Whatever profit they've shown, it's been very very low and it's from selling tax credits."" So despite the market leadership and the selling of 50,000 cars on average, they're still 'not'

making any money and if Jim will be able to meet Elon Musk someday, he'll say ""Job well done, so far"".  Tesla

""It's been painfully clearly but I will say for the first 4 years of those 5 years, it was actually not a bad short,"" Jim said that he still holds a position in Tesla. Despite these things that happened to Tesla, he mentioned that they were able to found lots of other things that are maybe even crazier than Tesla.

Jim Chanos also explained that in shorting, they use a percent of capital approach for risk management because if they use stop losses, they could have been stopped out from every single great position they ever had. ""Calibrating positions on a percent of capital basis for us has worked better,"" he admitted.

He was then questioned if Tesla is a good thing for the S&P 500 Index. ""A lot of people have bought the stock recently because its going into the S&P 500. I would want to point out to them that one of the ways to beat the S&P was to own Tesla over the past couple of years."".

Chanos said that 'they still like Tesla' but there are so many better stocks for them to trade now. ""Probably my highest conviction is an idea that will surprise the viewers. It's a company that nobody's heard of called IBM (NYSE:IBM)."" He said that IBM is a 'value trap' and they had a lot of success through the years in companies that looked cheap but have had structural fundamental problems. ""The company (IBM) we think, is still engaging in basically accounting high jinx. And it's hiding all in plain sight if you take a look at their numbers."" Jim added that IBM was supposed to earn $9 pro forma in 2020 but the actual number was just $6. He thinks that it's going to be only $5 dollars this year and $4 in 2022. ""IBM increasingly has engaged in lots of games to do this and the latest one is they're going to do a spin-off and now take a lot of charges, that they're going to ask you to add back as part of the adjusted earnings so that the actual gap earnings don't look so bad"". Jim Chanos said that IBM tried to do this thing about 5 years ago and they can only do this sort of 'illusion' for a short period of time. For him, we're in a period where IBM will sooner or later announce that ""we're not really earning $9, $12 or $13. We're actually earning $6, $5 and $4. And it's going to be the next reset."".  ibm, building, business, sign, wall, uk, laptop, tech fair, corporation, office automation, worldwide, international business, international fair, innovation, hardware, london,

As for commercial real estate, the reopening will be beneficial for things like hospitality and retail. Jim Chanos marked that commercial real estate peaked in 2018 and rents have been 'declining' ever since while the department store sales peaked in the year 2000. He said there have been real pressures that were happening in real estate even before the pandemic. ""The reason we're negative on real estate is due to interest rates and that cap rates in which people capitalize cash flows in the real estate business are back at all-time lows, meaning valuations on a dollar cash flow are at all-time highs."". He mentioned that this one is caused by the Fed's zero-interest-rate and because of people's belief that interest rates will never go up again. Jim cited SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) and Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) as examples of REIT's that backed down to the lows we saw in 2018-2019. ""The reason why some of these REITs are still lower is that the cash flows are down 30% YOY. And it's fascinating to us that people have sort of disregarded the cash flows were dropping before the pandemic and are going to stay under pressure because of oversupply of office space or retail space."". Jim thinks that the oversupply brought multiples back from all-time high to all-time low cap rates and it's the risk that investors have to take in commercial real estate. He is also certain that cash flows are going to continually decline even after the pandemic. According to Jim Chanos, there's going to be a 'very interesting opportunity' in the public markets versus the private markets in the commercial real estate since the need for office and retail space is going to be challenged as more retailers go out of business and landlords will be forced to cut rents due to the fact that the 'work from home' set up is now a trend.

Let’s now start to look at short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks:

10. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ)

Chanos had $972 thousand invested in HEDJ at the end of September. During the third quarter he boosted his stake in HEDJ by 113%.

8. Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV)

IVV was able to accumulate a huge 15.18% annual return for the last five years.

""It's really a business model and valuation issue with Tesla."". Tesla is trading at half a trillion dollars at the time of the interview and it had a revenue of $30 billion but he said that there is something they do not want in their accounting. Despite what everyone says, Tesla will still be an automobile company that competes with other companies that make cars. Chanos said that 'Tesla is the stock where people pin their hopes and dreams'. ""For some holders, it's an EV company. For other holders its a clean energy company. For other holders it's an autonomous vehicle company... It's whatever people want to believe."" Jim then pointed out that, ""For the trailing 12 months, Tesla 'has not made' any money selling cars. Whatever profit they've shown, it's been very very low and it's from selling tax credits."" So despite the market leadership and the selling of 50,000 cars on average, they're still 'not'

making any money and if Jim will be able to meet Elon Musk someday, he'll say ""Job well done, so far"".  Tesla

""It's been painfully clearly but I will say for the first 4 years of those 5 years, it was actually not a bad short,"" Jim said that he still holds a position in Tesla. Despite these things that happened to Tesla, he mentioned that they were able to found lots of other things that are maybe even crazier than Tesla.

Jim Chanos also explained that in shorting, they use a percent of capital approach for risk management because if they use stop losses, they could have been stopped out from every single great position they ever had. ""Calibrating positions on a percent of capital basis for us has worked better,"" he admitted.

He was then questioned if Tesla is a good thing for the S&P 500 Index. ""A lot of people have bought the stock recently because its going into the S&P 500. I would want to point out to them that one of the ways to beat the S&P was to own Tesla over the past couple of years."".

Chanos said that 'they still like Tesla' but there are so many better stocks for them to trade now. ""Probably my highest conviction is an idea that will surprise the viewers. It's a company that nobody's heard of called IBM (NYSE:IBM)."" He said that IBM is a 'value trap' and they had a lot of success through the years in companies that looked cheap but have had structural fundamental problems. ""The company (IBM) we think, is still engaging in basically accounting high jinx. And it's hiding all in plain sight if you take a look at their numbers."" Jim added that IBM was supposed to earn $9 pro forma in 2020 but the actual number was just $6. He thinks that it's going to be only $5 dollars this year and $4 in 2022. ""IBM increasingly has engaged in lots of games to do this and the latest one is they're going to do a spin-off and now take a lot of charges, that they're going to ask you to add back as part of the adjusted earnings so that the actual gap earnings don't look so bad"". Jim Chanos said that IBM tried to do this thing about 5 years ago and they can only do this sort of 'illusion' for a short period of time. For him, we're in a period where IBM will sooner or later announce that ""we're not really earning $9, $12 or $13. We're actually earning $6, $5 and $4. And it's going to be the next reset."".  ibm, building, business, sign, wall, uk, laptop, tech fair, corporation, office automation, worldwide, international business, international fair, innovation, hardware, london,

As for commercial real estate, the reopening will be beneficial for things like hospitality and retail. Jim Chanos marked that commercial real estate peaked in 2018 and rents have been 'declining' ever since while the department store sales peaked in the year 2000. He said there have been real pressures that were happening in real estate even before the pandemic. ""The reason we're negative on real estate is due to interest rates and that cap rates in which people capitalize cash flows in the real estate business are back at all-time lows, meaning valuations on a dollar cash flow are at all-time highs."". He mentioned that this one is caused by the Fed's zero-interest-rate and because of people's belief that interest rates will never go up again. Jim cited SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) and Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) as examples of REIT's that backed down to the lows we saw in 2018-2019. ""The reason why some of these REITs are still lower is that the cash flows are down 30% YOY. And it's fascinating to us that people have sort of disregarded the cash flows were dropping before the pandemic and are going to stay under pressure because of oversupply of office space or retail space."". Jim thinks that the oversupply brought multiples back from all-time high to all-time low cap rates and it's the risk that investors have to take in commercial real estate. He is also certain that cash flows are going to continually decline even after the pandemic. According to Jim Chanos, there's going to be a 'very interesting opportunity' in the public markets versus the private markets in the commercial real estate since the need for office and retail space is going to be challenged as more retailers go out of business and landlords will be forced to cut rents due to the fact that the 'work from home' set up is now a trend.

Let’s now start to look at short selling legend Jim Chanos' top 10 stock picks:

10. WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ)

Chanos had $972 thousand invested in HEDJ at the end of September. During the third quarter he boosted his stake in HEDJ by 113%.

HEDJ invests in Eurozone stocks that pay dividends. It is hedged to neutralize the exchange rate fluctuations between USD and EUR.

9. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)

Chanos had $1.1 million invested in EEM according to the latest 13F filing. EEM has an objective that seeks to monitor the overall quality performance of a market index that is a build-up of rising mid to large capitalizations market equities using a representative sampling indexing strategy.

They also offer effortless access to a variety of 800+ emerging market stocks. The funds' purpose is to be used as a segment of wider asset allocation strategies per se.

iShares focus more on the future term in order to achieve its goal to diversify globally and to seek long term growth. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and Tencent are among the funds' top three holdings as they try to beat their own annual return performance of 12.14% for the last 5 years.

8. Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV)

Jim Chanos had $1.1 million in XLV at the end of September. The funds' primary focus is to impart itself to be exposed to health-related industries, whether it be in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, or even in health care providers and services.

IVV was able to accumulate a huge 15.18% annual return for the last five years. As you can see Chanos isn't trying to fight the market, he is just trying to enhance his returns by shorting the overvalued stocks and reinvesting the proceeds indirectly into the biggest names in the market.

6. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)

Chanos had $2.2 million invested in XLK at the end of September. According to XLK, ""The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index"".

167,2021-01-08T13:01:24+00:00,Blackstone Really Wants to Refuel Your Private Jet,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A low-profile U.K. company serving the private jet business is suddenly making some very big friends.

Funds managed by Blackstone Group Inc. have teamed up with Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates in an attempted $4.3 billion bid for Signature Aviation Plc. It’s a formidable partnership that rival investment fund suitors Carlyle Group Inc. and Global Infrastructure Partners will have a tough job seeing off. But expect Nigel Rudd, Signature’s chairman and a veteran U.K. industrialist, to do his best to get an auction going.

Signature (formerly BBA Aviation) operates ancillary services like hangars, plane maintenance and, above all, refueling for small airfields. Its business dynamics are peculiar. On the one hand, there’s some cyclicality to performance. But over the long term, there are similarities to an infrastructure asset, implying the potential to hold above-average levels of debt. Nearly 90% of revenue is from the U.S.

If Signature was already private, it might not consider a listing at all, let alone one in London. Stock market investors, especially U.K. funds, tend to be more conservative about leverage. Blackstone has been trying to buy the company since February and got its target’s backing for a $5.17-a-share bid last month. With others sniffing around, Blackstone upped the ante on Friday revealing that Gates’s investment fund, Cascade Investment LLC, has partnered with the U.S. private equity firm on its bid. Cascade and affiliates already have 19% of Signature, and the fund will vote against any alternative proposal that comes after it and Blackstone have made a firm offer.

This makes life very hard for any interloper. A rival offer with a 75% acceptance threshold (as required under the U.K.’s simpler “scheme of arrangement” bid process) would likely fail depending on shareholder turnout. The gate-crasher would have to aim to get simple majority control, and then hope Cascade might either sell or partner up later, or stay on as a friendly co-investor. Not impossible, but hard.

Story continues

Blackstone’s bid involves a longer-term private equity vehicle and an infrastructure fund. Global Infrastructure Partners is a dedicated infrastructure fund. Auctions involving such buyers can get heated: Their perspective tends to be in decades, with assets held on a perpetual basis. That means the returns expectations are much lower than for a private equity transaction, and the prices paid tend to go higher. Analysts at United First Partners reckon Blackstone-Cascade could sweeten their proposal by 5%-12% and still achieve a long-term internal rate of return of 10-12%, typically sufficient for an infrastructure fund.

Doubling down on the private-jet market is a tricky look for Gates. For the deal to make the slightest sense from an ESG perspective, Cascade needs to have a clear plan for reducing emissions here.

While the Blackstone approach is more than 50% above Signature’s undisturbed three-month average price, the market is betting on a higher offer. That’s clearly something of a gamble given the circumstances: Its pitch isn’t even binding yet. Signature is a sizeable asset, it’s not the only way of getting exposure to this industry. Rudd has presided over the sale of some high profile U.K. firms in his time. Even for him, getting an auction going here is going to be a challenge.

169,2021-01-08T12:45:45+00:00,PS5 A Major Catalyst For This Small Cap Video Game Stock; Could Xbox Be Next?,"Small cap Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR) is rising as its haptic technology could be added to a second major gaming console after its success with another.

What Happened: Immersion has a royalty deal with Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE). The deal allows the company to use Immersion’s haptic technology in gaming and VR controllers, including the strong selling PlayStation 5.

After the success of the PlayStation 5 and the strong reviews for the controller, Sony’s gaming rival Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is considering adding haptic technology to controllers.

Microsoft sent an Xbox console experience survey to its users that asks questions about the controllers. Questions ask if the Xbox Series X feels next-gen and if users are aware of features on Playstation controllers that they wish were on Xbox controllers, according to TechRadar.

“I applaud what they did with the controller. I think for all of us in the industry, we should learn from each other and the innovation that we all push on, whether it’s distribution of business model like Game Pass, or controller tech,” Microsoft Vice President of Gaming Phil Spencer told The Verge.

Why It’s Important: Xbox has a history of adding well-received features on other console controllers to its own, IGN points out. The gaming publication has called the PlayStation 5 controller one of the most impressive features of the new console from Sony, scoring it a 9 out of 10.

“Microsoft’s interest in these questions would suggest that they’re at least thinking about upgrading the next-gen controllers in the future, to line up with Sony’s offering in the current-generation,” writes IGN.

Haptic technology could be a major theme for video games going forward as it connects users to the games and makes a more interactive experience.

Story continues

Several 2021 games like “Returnal” and “Deathloop” are taking advantage of the haptic technology of the PS5 controller and making the game more interactive for users.

Immersion has hinted throughout 2020 that the new controller for the PlayStation 5 could lead to additional demand for its patents and products.

“We believe Sony’s new controller will catalyze increased market demand for advanced interactive haptic experiences and this may lead to additional opportunities for Immersion in the future,” the company said.

What’s Next: Immersion is expected to announce fourth-quarter earnings in March. The earnings should provide a better look into the revenue generated from Sony and could provide more color on how much Immersion gets as a royalty for each PlayStation 5 controller sold.

Immersion reported revenue of $7.6 million versus street consensus of $7.45 million for the third quarter. The fourth quarter of the last fiscal year was the largest for the company in terms of revenue.

Benzinga’s Take: We highlighted Immersion in July and December and mentioned how important the PlayStation 5 inclusion was for the company. The deal with Sony was a major catalyst and adding Microsoft to the fold could be just as valuable.

Shares of Immersion closed Thursday up 9.5% to $12.08. Shares were up 46% in the last 52 weeks.

170,2021-01-08T03:21:50+00:00,China’s Baidu Teams With Geely on Electric Cars,"(Bloomberg) --

Baidu Inc. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. will team up to make electric vehicles for the Chinese market, a person familiar with the matter said, deepening the internet giant’s foray into automobiles as its core business slows.

Geely’s shares soared as much as 10% in Hong Kong, while Baidu gained 2% in New York. The pair may announce their new venture as early as next week, the person said, asking not to be identified talking about a private deal. China’s internet search leader picked the fast-growing carmaker after discussions with potential partners including closely held WM Motor, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. and FAW Group, the person said. It will control the venture with a majority stake, the person added. Reuters first reported on the deal.

The tie-up marks a significant expansion into auto-making for Baidu, which has for years touted its Apollo open-sourced platform to help manufacturers build autonomous driving and connectivity into their products. The move precedes a Hong Kong share sale that’s said to be on track to raise $3.5 billion to fuel the search giant’s ambitions beyond advertising.

Baidu’s venture with Geely is intended to push Apollo’s adoption in more vehicles, the person said. It will start by building EVs for the world’s largest vehicle arena at Geely plants, though it’s unclear if the partners intend to eventually also produce self-driving cars. Representatives for the two companies declined to comment.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Baidu’s plan to make smart electric vehicles with Geely, as reported by Reuters, may boost the company’s investor appeal as it seeks a $3.5 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong during 1H. While details of the electric-vehicle project are scarce and sales may not cover costs for years, it may be a step towards monetization of Baidu’s autonomous-driving platform Apollo, which it has heavily invested in since 2015.

The platform, which has been described as an Android for automobiles, has about 130 members including Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co., BYD Co., Microsoft Corp. and Geely’s own Volvo Cars.

Baidu aims to monetize Apollo, which the company has sunk billions of dollars since 2015. While advertising remains its bread-and-butter, the company has made bets to commercialize its AI technology through self-driving cars and smart speakers. Carmakers like WM Motor and Geely already employ Baidu’s autonomous techniques, and it has won government deals to develop transport networks and test robo-taxis in cities like Guangzhou and Chongqing.

Baidu’s move underscores how global internet giants are firming up plans to get their technology in front of car buyers who increasingly prize connectivity and smart features over traditional driving mechanics. Apple Inc. is said to have created a team of engineers developing drive systems, vehicle interior and external car body designs with the goal of eventually shipping a vehicle. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has formed a venture with Chinese giant SAIC to explore smart vehicles.

The sector also got attention as a winner due to the number of people who were at home during the pandemic. Here’s a look at what could be ahead in 2021 for video game stocks.

Sony Corporation: The PlayStation 5 had strong sales in 2020 and was the winner in the console wars battle. The story for 2021 for Sony could be the company’s exclusive titles, which could be among the reasons it won in 2020.

The company has “Returnal,” “Gran Turismo 7” and ”Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart” as console exclusives. Sony is also expected to release “God of War: Ragnarok” in 2021, which has been listed as one of the most anticipated games of 2021.

Microsoft: While Microsoft didn’t win the 2020 console war battle, it did make a large gaming-related acquisition with its purchase of ZeniMax Media. The deal gives Microsoft control of hit franchises like “Dishonored,” “Fallout,” “Doom” and “The Elder Scrolls.”

The studio will release a new first-person shooter with “Deathloop,” which is ironically a Playstation 5 exclusive timed release.

Microsoft will also release “Halo Infinite” in fall 2021, a highly anticipated exclusive game that was initially supposed to release with the Xbox Series X.

Activision Blizzard: Video game publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) is rumored to release “Overwatch 2,” the highly anticipated sequel to the game released five years ago that is now a popular esports league. The sequel could increase interest in the name going forward.

The Blizzard unit could also have a huge 2021 with the potential release of “Diablo 4” for PC and “Diablo Immortal” for mobile. Blizzard’s latest release in the “World of Warcraft” series posted record-breaking numbers in 2020.

Story continues

Nintendo: Despite the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo Co (Pink: NTDOY) outperformed both stocks with a 60% gain versus 40% gains from the other two.

The company topped the leaderboards for years with its Switch console before the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

The Switch could continue to outperform in 2021 with exclusive titles coming like “Monster Hunter Rise,” “Pokemon Snap” and the potential sequel to “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.”

Immersion: With the PlayStation 5 selling well, one of the potential winners for 2021 could be Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR), the company providing the haptic technology for the DualSense controllers.

Several games coming in 2021 like “Returnal” and “Deathloop” are designed to take advantage of the haptic feedback in the controllers.

Amazon: A wild card to watch in the gaming sector for 2021 is Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company owns Twitch, a leader in video game streaming in the U.S.

The story in 2021 could be the release of “New World” in the spring.

The MMORPG from Amazon was one of three games announced back in 2016 and the only one to make it to the release stage. The success and reception of the game could influence how big of a focus Amazon puts on video games in the future.

175,2021-01-04T12:31:59+00:00,C3.ai Draws Mixed Reviews One Month Post-IPO,"By Christiana Sciaudone

Investing.com -- C3 Ai Inc (NYSE:AI) dropped 10% on Monday after analyst ratings on the newly public company came in mixed.

Wedbush to Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) give it a buy, Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and Keybanc see a hold, while Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) says sell, StreetInsider reported.

The AI software provider went public in early December, jumping as much as 174% on its first day of trading, Business Insider reported.

The company was founded by a former Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) executive, Tom Siebel, and raised $651 million in its IPO.

Morgan Stanley set a $100 price target, saying that C3.ai's ""compelling growth opportunity ahead"" is already priced into the stock, The Street reported.

JMP Securities, however, set a price target of $167 and a buy-equivalent rating.

""We view C3 as an excellent opportunity for long-term durable growth and capital appreciation for a number of reasons,"" Street Insider reported analyst Patrick Walravens. He cited Siebel's leadership and experience, the focus on artificial intelligence projects in the commercial industrial sector with the potential to return significant economic value and a set of partnerships that should supplement C3’s go-to-market capabilities over time, with companies like Baker Hughes, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), among other reasons, StreetInsider reported.

Last week, a Motley Fool article noted that while C3.ai has plenty of potential and room to grow, the stock is too expensive at 85 times last year's sales. Even if revenue doubles, it would still be more expensive than Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), which trades at roughly 30 times next year's sales.

176,2020-12-31T12:47:12+00:00,3 Cybersecurity Stocks That May Give Double-Digit Returns in 2021,"The cybersecurity industry has been witnessing a bullish trend, of late, thanks to the SolarWinds SWI Orion software hack, which has made thousands of companies vulnerable to cyberattack.

The First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF CIBR, which tracks the performance of companies engaged in the cybersecurity segment, has gained 14.9% this month so far. Moreover, the ETP has returned 47.7% this year so far, outperforming the broader market indices. The Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 increased 6.6%, 43.4% and 15.5%, respectively year to date.

SolarWinds’ Orion Software Hack

In a Dec 14 SEC filing, SolarWinds said that its Orion network monitoring products, rolled out between March and June, fell prey to a highly-sophisticated, manual supply-chain attack. SolarWinds believes its Orion networking monitoring products were used to compromise the servers of nearly 18,000 of the company’s customers.

FireEye FEYE was the first to report on Dec 8 that highly sophisticated state-sponsored hackers stole its Red Team tools, which are used by the company’s officials for testing customer security.

It was later discovered that hackers used a backdoor in SolarWinds’ Orion network management software. Following that, a number of U.S. state agencies and organizations, including Microsoft MSFT and Intel INTC reported data breaches using SolarWinds’ software.

Cybersecurity Stocks to Gain

The silver lining to this episode has been increase in demand for security-related purchases by both companies and governments spurred by such a high-level security breach.

While the incident is a major blow to SolarWinds, it could bring cybersecurity stocks back into the limelight.

Notably, the financial well-being, brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.

Clearly, cases of data breaches drive the need to beef up cyber-safety measures, thereby fueling demand for the services offered by Internet-security companies.

Cybersecurity Market Promises Growth Ahead

Various independent research firms forecast stellar demand ahead for cybersecurity solutions. According to a Fortune Business Insights report, worldwide cybersecurity market size is set to reach $281.74 billion by 2027 from $112.01 billion in 2019, indicating compound annual growth rate of 12.6% during the period.

Furthermore, cybersecurity has become a matter of great importance over the past few months, as most of the employees across the country have taken to working from home amid the pandemic.

As vaccination programs will take several months to reach a major portion of the global population, these factors are likely to continue to benefit the cybersecurity companies in 2021. Let’s thus take a closer look at some notable cybersecurity stocks that could generate double-digit return next year.

Qualys QLYS offers cloud security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology infrastructures, thus helping protect their IT systems and applications from cyber-attacks.

Qualys is benefiting from surging demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge part of the global workforce is working remotely. Accelerated digital transformations by organizations are also fueling demand for the company’s cloud-based security solutions. As the remote-working trend and digital transformation initiatives by organizations are expected to continue next year, Qualys is well poised to benefit, given its strong portfolio of cloud-based security solutions.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings has moved 9.1% north to $2.87 per share over the past 60 days. For 2021, the consensus estimate has been revised 20 cents upward to $2.99 per share over the same time frame. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have been up 43.6% year to date.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Fortinet FTNT is one of the dominant players in the Unified Threat Management (UTM) space, which is one of the fastest-evolving segments in the network security space.

The company’s ability to meld next-generation, cloud-based firewalls with SD-WAN allows it to grab an early lead in the SASE market. Its Opaq Networks buyout in July will act like a catalyst. Also, this company has been gaining from heightening cyber-attack risks that are propelling demand for its FortiMail platform.

Fortinet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2020 earnings has been revised upward by a couple of cents to $3.25 per share over the past 30 days. For 2021, earnings estimates have revised 1.4% higher to $3.57 over the same time frame. The stock has gained 38.6% in the year so far.

FireEye is currently focusing on cloud-based protection services. Earlier this year, it unveiled FireEye Messaging Security, which protects collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack. This solution is designed to reduce risks of cyber-infiltrations by scanning objects and links shared in the collaboration tool to identify zero-day malware and phishing links in real time.

In addition, FireEye has added the User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) tool to its Helix platform. The tool uses machine learning to set a baseline behavior and monitors any deviation from it. This helps the firm identify risky entities and protect organizations from security threats.

This Zacks Rank #3 stock has gained 39.5% in the year so far. The consensus estimate for the ongoing year and next year’s earnings per share have been stable at 29 cents and 34 cents, respectively over the past 60 days.

What Happened: Third Point CEO Daniel Loeb wrote to Intel’s chairman Omar Ishrak requesting ""immediate action"" to boost the company’s position as a provider of processor chips for PCs and data centers.

The changes could lead to a major shakeup at Intel.

“Intel welcomes input from all investors regarding enhanced shareholder value. In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal,” Intel said in a statement to Reuters.

Why It Matters: Intel customers like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) are designing in-house processors for server computers running on the company’s cloud services, a development that will reduce reliance on Intel’s chip technology.

The company is under pressure to remain competitive as its clients take business in-house.

INTC Price Action: Intel shares gained 4.93% Tuesday to end the session at $49.39.

The stock has a 52-week high of $69.29 and a 52-week low of $43.63.

178,2020-12-29T08:00:20+00:00,Stanford Scientists Create a Billionaire Factory,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the most unsettling developments in business in 2020 was the trend for electric-vehicle companies to list on a stock exchange before they have their first revenues. Though standard practice for research-intensive life sciences companies, going public before you have a purchasable product is pretty unusual in the automotive world.

And yet, pre-revenue companies such as Nikola Corp. and Fisker Inc. have achieved multi-billion dollar valuations. Now, Californian battery start-up QuantumScape Corp. has taken electric-vehicle mania to a new level.

Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company. The company won’t generate significant revenue until 2026, but it’s already valued at $43 billion, or $51 billion on a fully diluted basis.(1)

From a climate perspective, it’s great that investors are committing capital to electric transport. The promise of such riches will encourage others to join the emissions-cutting cause. However, the same speculative fever that has propelled Tesla Inc. and China’s NIO Inc. appears to have taken hold of QuantumScape investors.

An average of $2.8 billion of the battery company’s stock was traded daily during the past week. Technical factors may have contributed to QuantumScape’s surge, too: Only a small percentage of the shareholder register is available to trade.(7) For retail investors who buy stock at these levels, there’s a long way down.

First, the good news. In laboratory tests QuantumScape’s “solid state” battery cells have achieved very encouraging results, which suggest the innovative chemistry could one day enable electric vehicles to travel further and be charged faster, at lower cost.(2) This is exciting because it’s become harder to extract significant performance gains from conventional lithium ion batteries. Chief Executive Officer Jagdeep Singh’s team of scientists appears to have pulled off a real feat.

Story continues

However, when the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate.(6) This seemed ample for a company with fewer than 250 employees and one which doesn’t have a finished product or factory. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value, and more than automakers like Ford Motor Co. and battery giants such as Panasonic Corp. and Samsung SDI.

Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return, while QuantumScape warrants that once sold for 80 cents are now worth 50 times as much.(3) The three Stanford founders — Singh, Fritz Prinz and Tim Holme — have become paper billionaires. Volkswagen, which invested about $300 million in QuantumScape, will own a 23% stake worth almost $10 billion. (4)

As is often the case with SPACs, the Kensington sponsor — controlled by Justin Mirro, a former Moelis & Company and RBC Capital Markets investment banker — has also done well. It received shares and warrants worth more than $900m, a huge return on its $7 million or so investment and one achieved with only a few weeks work.(5)

QuantumScape’s other prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros’s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. Such endorsements, and the years of R&D that have gone into the batteries, suggest there’s more here than just hype. The contrast with Nikola, whose own technology (or lack of it) was the subject of a scathing short-seller report, seems clear.(8)

Volkswagen’s production expertise should smooth the path to commercialization. The partners plan to start production at a small pilot facility in 2024, and then at a much larger factory two years later. But success isn’t guaranteed.

So far QuantumScape has only produced single-layer cells and it still needs to find a way to stack more than 100 on top of each other to create a battery package. Competitors such as China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., won’t sit by idly. CATL’s shares have also surged this year, valuing it at about $110 billion.

One advantage of SPACs is that they’re allowed to publish detailed multiyear financial forecasts, whereas companies that go public via a traditional initial public offering usually only publish historic finances. Given QuantumScape’s significant production hurdles, it would be imprudent for investors to over-rely on these estimates, but whatever happens they’re in for a long wait:

Even assuming QuantumScape’s forecasts prove accurate, the valuation looks disconnected from reality. The market capitalization is equivalent to 13 times the revenue the company hopes to generate in 2027. Tesla shares are also incredibly frothy but they’re a comparative steal at slightly more than 13 times its expected revenue in the next 12 months. Volkswagen, which will be QuantumScape’s biggest customer at first, is valued at just 0.3 times next year’s sales.

QuantumScape’s batteries may end up propelling the next generation of electric vehicles, but sustaining that valuation could prove even more challenging than advanced battery chemistry.

(This column was updated to remove a comparison with Alphabet’s stock trading volumes, because the reference didn’t account for all of the company’s trading lines.)

(1) The fully diluted 447.5 million share count includes unexercised stock options, restricted stock units and additional shares issuable to Volkswagen.

(2) The SPAC's public shareholders account for only 5% of the shareholder register. Existing QuantumScape shareholders hold 82%, some of whom aren't sellers or are subject to lock-ups.

(3) QuantumScape’s design doesn’t require a manufactured anode, which keeps costs down. The lithium-metal anode is formed when the cell is charged.

(4) When adjusted for QuantumScape’s cash.

(5) If QuantumScape elects to redeem them, the warrants will convert to a maximum of 0.365 shares.

(6) Volkswagen owns 71 million shares of QuantumScape but will be issued another 15 million subject to achievement of a technical performance milestone, according to the S-1.

(7) Kensington sold shares in an IPO on June 30 and had already signed a non-binding letter of intent with QuantumScape just three weeks later.

(8) QuantumScape also has far more patents, for example.

Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company. The company won’t generate significant revenue until 2026, but it’s already valued at $43 billion, or $51 billion on a fully diluted basis.(1)

From a climate perspective, it’s great that investors are committing capital to electric transport. The promise of such riches will encourage others to join the emissions-cutting cause. However, the same speculative fever that has propelled Tesla Inc. and China’s NIO Inc. appears to have taken hold of QuantumScape investors.

An average of $2.8 billion of the battery company’s stock was traded daily during the past week. Technical factors may have contributed to QuantumScape’s surge, too: Only a small percentage of the shareholder register is available to trade.(7) For retail investors who buy stock at these levels, there’s a long way down.

First, the good news. In laboratory tests QuantumScape’s “solid state” battery cells have achieved very encouraging results, which suggest the innovative chemistry could one day enable electric vehicles to travel further and be charged faster, at lower cost.(2) This is exciting because it’s become harder to extract significant performance gains from conventional lithium ion batteries. Chief Executive Officer Jagdeep Singh’s team of scientists appears to have pulled off a real feat.

However, when the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate.(6) This seemed ample for a company with fewer than 250 employees and one which doesn’t have a finished product or factory. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value, and more than automakers like Ford Motor Co. and battery giants such as Panasonic Corp. and Samsung SDI.

Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return, while QuantumScape warrants that once sold for 80 cents are now worth 50 times as much.(3) The three Stanford founders — Singh, Fritz Prinz and Tim Holme — have become paper billionaires. Volkswagen, which invested about $300 million in QuantumScape, will own a 23% stake worth almost $10 billion. (4)

As is often the case with SPACs, the Kensington sponsor — controlled by Justin Mirro, a former Moelis & Company and RBC Capital Markets investment banker — has also done well. It received shares and warrants worth more than $900m, a huge return on its $7 million or so investment and one achieved with only a few weeks work.(5)

QuantumScape’s other prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros’s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. Such endorsements, and the years of R&D that have gone into the batteries, suggest there’s more here than just hype. The contrast with Nikola, whose own technology (or lack of it) was the subject of a scathing short-seller report, seems clear.(8)

Volkswagen’s production expertise should smooth the path to commercialization. The partners plan to start production at a small pilot facility in 2024, and then at a much larger factory two years later. But success isn’t guaranteed.

So far QuantumScape has only produced single-layer cells and it still needs to find a way to stack more than 100 on top of each other to create a battery package. Competitors such as China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., won’t sit by idly. CATL’s shares have also surged this year, valuing it at about $110 billion.

One advantage of SPACs is that they’re allowed to publish detailed multiyear financial forecasts, whereas companies that go public via a traditional initial public offering usually only publish historic finances. Given QuantumScape’s significant production hurdles, it would be imprudent for investors to over-rely on these estimates, but whatever happens they’re in for a long wait:

Even assuming QuantumScape’s forecasts prove accurate, the valuation looks disconnected from reality. The market capitalization is equivalent to 13 times the revenue the company hopes to generate in 2027. Tesla shares are also incredibly frothy but they’re a comparative steal at slightly more than 13 times its expected revenue in the next 12 months. Volkswagen, which will be QuantumScape’s biggest customer at first, is valued at just 0.3 times next year’s sales.

QuantumScape’s batteries may end up propelling the next generation of electric vehicles, but sustaining that valuation could prove even more challenging than advanced battery chemistry.

(This column was updated to remove a comparison with Alphabet’s stock trading volumes, because the reference didn’t account for all of the company’s trading lines.)

(1) The fully diluted 447.5 million share count includes unexercised stock options, restricted stock units and additional shares issuable to Volkswagen.

(2) The SPAC's public shareholders account for only 5% of the shareholder register. Existing QuantumScape shareholders hold 82%, some of whom aren't sellers or are subject to lock-ups.

(3) QuantumScape’s design doesn’t require a manufactured anode, which keeps costs down. The lithium-metal anode is formed when the cell is charged.

(4) When adjusted for QuantumScape’s cash.

(5) If QuantumScape elects to redeem them, the warrants will convert to a maximum of 0.365 shares.

(6) Volkswagen owns 71 million shares of QuantumScape but will be issued another 15 million subject to achievement of a technical performance milestone, according to the S-1.

(7) Kensington sold shares in an IPO on June 30 and had already signed a non-binding letter of intent with QuantumScape just three weeks later.

(8) QuantumScape also has far more patents, for example.

183,2020-12-28T18:19:07+00:00,Here’s How Billionaire Lee Cooperman Is Preparing For Massive Inflation,"We are in the middle of a massive monetary and fiscal stimulus cycle which is already showing its effects on forex markets. In this article, we talked about billionaire Lee Cooperman's massive inflation predictions and presented his favorite investment ideas heading into 2021. Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Lee Cooperman's 5 Favorite Stocks Heading Into 2021.

Leon Cooperman, the self-made billionaire and the chairman and CEO of investment firm Omega Advisors, believes stock markets are accurately priced. The 77 years old living legend has turned his hedge fund into a family office in 2018, saying I can’t chase S&P 500 for the rest of my life. Cooperman’s hedge fund Omega Advisors have generated more than 12% annualized returns since inception through 2018.

He worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years before establishing Omega Advisors in 1991. The billionaire investor has recently expressed concerns over the rising US debt on a TV show. Meanwhile, Cooperman also expressed confidence in gold markets for the first time in his investing career. The gold price has hit new record levels in 2020, thanks to investors' move towards safe-haven assets in the wake of pandemic and concerns over the US dollar value depreciation.

""I bought gold for the first time in my life. I understand the case for gold. We're on the way to some banana republic situation. Nobody's worrying about the debt that's being created.""

The investing guru particularly focuses on the fundamentals of companies when making buying or selling decisions. His investment philosophy has also been concentrated on macro trends.

The billionaire legend has kept investments in energy companies despite historic down cycles in 2020 amid pandemic and slowing demand. Cooperman claims that oil prices will trade around $60 a barrel. Crude oil prices are currently trading around $48 a barrel, representing a substantial recovery after going negative during the second quarter of 2020.

The legendary investor also believes in market trends. He sold old-fashioned banking giant JP Morgan's (NYSE: JPM) stake in the latest quarter, according to 13F filings. However, Leon Cooperman has expressed strong confidence in the emerging financial services technology providers like Fiserv (NASDAQ: FISV) and Mr. Cooper Group Inc (NASDAQ: COOP). The legendary investor has also been enhancing stakes in the fastest growing technology and communication sector. OMEGA ADVISORS Leon Cooperman

Portfolio diversification is also among the key factors when it comes to beating the markets, according to the billionaire Leon Cooperman.

Omega Advisors family office has diversified its portfolio towards several sectors including financial services, energy, technology, materials, healthcare, and communication services. The financial sector accounts for around 23% of the overall portfolio, while the technology and communication sectors stand around 17% and 11%, respectively. The top ten holdings represent 63.7% of the portfolio.

Leon Cooperman has made several changes in the portfolio in the latest quarter to align with the business environment. The family office fund has sold out 6 stocks and reduced stakes in 9 stocks. On the other hand, the legendary investor purchased 7 stocks and added to its 13 existing positions. At the end of the third quarter, Omega's equity portfolio market value stood around $1.017 billion.

While Leon Cooperman's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

It’s worth watching how the legendary investor has been playing with the stock market when the valuations of the majority of stocks are at record levels. We decided to review billionaire Leon Cooperman's favorite stocks heading into 2021 and in the midst of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus.

10. Athene Holding Ltd. (NYSE:ATH)

The mid-cap life and health insurance firm Athene Holding Ltd. (NYSE: ATH) is among the favorite stocks billionaire Leon Cooperman's like to hold in a portfolio heading into 2021. The firm has initiated a position in Athene Holding during the third quarter of 2020. It is the tenth-largest stock holding in Omega Advisors family office portfolio valued at $33.45 million, accounting for 3.29% of the overall portfolio.

Although Athene shares underperformed in 2020, the stock price recovered strongly in the past three months, thanks to strong organic growth. The company says they are on track to reach a record $50B of total organic and inorganic volumes in 2020.

Meanwhile, other hedge funds remained less bullish about Athene Holding's performance. The insurance company was in 31 hedge funds’ portfolio at the end of September compared to an all-time high for 50.

Lakewood Capital Management, a fund holding a long position in Athene, commented about the prospects of the insurance company in an investor letter. Here is what Lakewood Capital Management said:

“We previously discussed our long position in Athene Holding in our third quarter 2019 letter, and the stock performed well over the next several months as management continued to execute on its competitively advantaged strategy in retirement services. However, Athene’s stock was punished by the pandemic-related sell-off, and at 60% of tangible book value, we believe it has the potential to double over the next 18 months.”

9. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)

The world's largest e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the ninth-largest stock holding of the Omega Advisors family office portfolio, accounting for 3.56% of the portfolio. The investment is valued at $36.2 million. Billionaire Lee Cooperman has been holding a position in an e-commerce giant since 2016.

Shares of Amazon rallied almost 80% in the last twelve months, extending the five years gains to 480%. The pandemic-related social distancing policies along with consumer's shift towards online platforms added to share price gains and financial numbers in the past couple of quarters.

Baron Opportunity Fund, which has generated a 17.92% return in the third quarter, looks optimistic about Amazon. Here’s what Baron Opportunity Fund stated about Amazon in the shareholder's letter:

“While e-commerce penetration is rising rapidly and Amazon continues to grow its addressable market by entering new verticals, we continue to view Amazon Web Services as the more material driver of the company given its leadership in the vast and growing cloud infrastructure market and potential to compete in application software in the years to come.”

8. Ferro Corporation (NYSE:FOE)

The specialty materials producer and marketer Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) is among the billionaire Lee Cooperman's favorite stocks heading into 2021. Omega Advisors family office initiated a position in Ferro during the fourth quarter of 2019. Omega has raised its stake in the specialty materials company by 3% in the latest quarter.

Shares of Ferro Corporation recovered sharply in the last three months after experiencing a massive selloff at the beginning of 2020. Its third-quarter revenue fell 33% year over year to $241 million amid pandemic related challenges.

7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

The technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the seventh-largest stock holding of Omega Advisors family office portfolio. MSFT stake accounted for 5.08% of the overall portfolio at the end of the latest quarter. The legendary investor has been showing confidence in the technology giant since the fourth quarter of 2015.

Other hedge funds are also bullish on Microsoft. It was in 234 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of September while the all-time high for this statistics is 235. MSFT ranks #2 among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.

RiverPark Advisors is also bullish on Microsoft and the firm has commented about the tech giant in the shareholder's letter. Here’s what RiverPark Advisors stated:

“The overall Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) industry is growing more than 30% per year and is forecast to reach $100 billion of revenues by 2021. We believe that cloud-based services can become the company’s largest revenue and earnings producer and expect Microsoft to generate significant and growing free cash flow ($11 billion last quarter, up 19% year-over-year). The company should deliver at least mid-to-high teens EPS growth, with upside from deploying its $134 billion cash balance ($7 billion was returned to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share buybacks). We trimmed our position on strength, and Microsoft remains a top-five position in the Fund.”

6. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ASH)

The specialty chemical provider Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ASH) is the long-running investment of billionaire Lee Cooperman. The firm first initiated a position in Ashland in 2014 while the Cooperman family office added to its existing position in the latest quarter. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of the Omega family office portfolio.

Ashland Global Holdings underperformed in 2020. However, the billionaire investor has bagged significant dividends from the specialty chemical company. It currently offers a dividend yield of 1.40%.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Finance Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Leon Cooperman.

Leon Cooperman, the Chairman and CEO of investment advisory firm Omega Advisors, is a titan of the hedge fund industry. The billionaire money manager rose from humble beginnings in the Bronx to become the leader of Goldman Sachs’ asset management division.

Cooperman retired in 1991 after 25 years with the company to launch his own hedge fund, the main fund of which generated annualized returns of 12.4% from inception through mid-2018, beating the S&P 500 by an average of about 2.9 percentage points annually during that period. Tired of chasing said S&P, Cooperman converted the fund into a family office at the end of 2018.

The 77-year-old Cooperman remains a prominent and respected figure in the finance world, being consulted regularly on CNBC and other media outlets and hasn’t shied away from making bold predictions in the coronavirus era. Best Finance Stocks To Buy Now Leon Cooperman Omega Advisors

Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors

In a May interview on The Reopening podcast, Cooperman stated that capitalism was likely to be changed forever given the widespread government intervention in the economy during the pandemic, saying that if the government will protect us from that kind of downside risk, then it likewise has the right to regulate the upside. In that same vein, he suggested taxes will continue to climb higher as America shifts further to the left, especially if Biden won the presidency, which was eventually the case.

Cooperman further suggested that the stock market is now more expensive than credit, and stated later in a separate interview on CNBC that the market’s rapid growth from its pandemic lows has likely come at the expense of future gains, predicting that returns are likely to be “relatively unimpressive for a long time”.

Not all richly valued stocks are created equal however, as Cooperman noted during a September RealVision interview that tech giants Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), were not expensive given interest rates.

Story continues

Cooperman held all four of those stocks in his highly concentrated 13F portfolio as of September 30, though it was finance sector stocks that had the heaviest weighting in that portfolio at about 31%. We’ll take a look at the billionaire investing legend’s ten favorite finance stocks below.

Hedge funds’ reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. That doesn’t mean there isn’t money to be made off their consensus stock picks. Our research has shown that hedge funds’ small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 66 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Now then, let’s check out the 10 Best Finance Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Leon Cooperman. Note that all hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 800+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey as part of our market-beating investment strategy.

10. Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:AC)

We begin with Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:AC), which Leon Cooperman owned 8,600 shares of at the end of Q3, selling off 43 of them during the quarter. It’s the first of two stocks on this list with direct hedge fund ties, as Associated Capital was spun off from Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO in 2015.

AC is somewhat of an interesting pick of Cooperman’s given that it aims to use its capital in pursuit of private equity and late stage venture capital. Cooperman took a shot at the former last year, calling private equity a “scam” during an investment event in September and warning that the industry’s returns would evaporate as interest rates rose (which of course hasn’t happened).

Associated Capital managed $1.25 billion in assets at the end of Q3, down from $1.65 billion a year earlier. The investment manager’s Q3 revenue likewise declined to $1.95 million, down from $2.75 million in 2019, though its diluted net income per share held steady at $0.26.

9. Falcon Minerals Corporation (NASDAQ:FLMN)

FLMN ranks 9th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. Leon Cooperman has owned a stake in Falcon Minerals Corporation (NASDAQ:FLMN) since the middle of 2019 and boosted that position by 245,648 shares in Q3. 20 hedge funds were long FLMN on September 30.

Cooperman revealed on CNBC in March that he was bullish on energy-related companies, expecting oil prices to rebound. Falcon Minerals is generally considered an energy company given its assets are all oil and gas related, but it’s also akin to a finance company given that it’s not involved in the production side of its assets (and thus has no capex requirements) and that its core strategy is to return the vast majority of its high-margin cash flow to investors through dividends.

Falcon Minerals owns 256,000 gross unit acres with over 3,000 potential drilling locations in the Eagle Ford Shale, as well as royalty assets covering 68,000 gross unit acres in the Marcellus Shale. Falcon generated pro forma free cash flow of $0.07 per share during Q3 and raised its quarterly dividend by 117% to $0.065 per share, returning 93% of that cash flow to investors.

8. First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCRD)

FCRD ranks 8th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. Cooperman made a large investment in First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCRD) during Q3, buying 2.68 million shares to build a 9.5% ownership stake in the business development company, which is a separate, publicly traded division of First Eagle Investment Management.

FCRD has a portfolio of assets primarily comprised of 1st lien senior secured debt in middle market companies across a wide range of industries. The company earned $3.2 million in net investment income during Q3, down from $6.9 million a year earlier, declines which were attributed to portfolio contraction and an increase in non-accrual (unpaid) status loans.

The BDC was forced to slash its quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.10 earlier this year, though as the stock has cratered by 43% in 2020, shares still yield a hefty 11.08%.

7. MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC)

MVC ranks 7th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC) represents one of the oldest holdings in Leon Cooperman’s portfolio, dating back to early 2015. He owned 1.70 million shares of the business development company on September 30, unchanged throughout the third quarter.

In August, MVC Capital entered into a merger agreement with Barings BDC in a deal valued at approximately $177.5 million in cash and stock for MVC shareholders. Cooperman expressed his satisfaction with the deal and entered into a voting agreement that will see him vote his shares in favor of the transaction.

“We are pleased with the result and thank the board of MVC Capital for its hard work and success in delivering an excellent outcome for shareholders. We believe this transaction represents strong shareholder alignment and provides the best path forward,” Cooperman said.

The combined company will have more than $1.2 billion of pro forma investments and is estimated to earn net investment income of as much as $0.20 per share in the first full quarter following the deal’s completion, which was expected to occur during the current quarter.

6. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) rounds out the first half of the list of Leon Cooperman’s top finance stock picks, with the billionaire maintaining his 370,000-share position in the company, which ranks as one of the 10 Best Bank Stocks To Buy Right Now.

Cooperman reopened a stake in Citigroup in late 2017 after selling off his previous position in the stock during 2016. At the time (late 2017) he expressed confidence in the financial sector as a whole given his expectation that interest rates would keep rising and boost banks’ profit margins. That was indeed the case throughout 2018 and Citi did indeed boost its earnings during that year, hitting a 10-year high with diluted earnings per share of $6.68, which it improved upon further last year.

Interest rates began falling again in late 2019 however and then plummeted to 0.25% in the wake of the pandemic, and Citigroup’s bottom line has understandably suffered again as a result. Cooperman has nonetheless maintained his position in Citi throughout 2020. The stock currently trades at a significant discount to its book value, offers a nice dividend yield of 3.44%, and could be poised for a nice run coming out of the pandemic.

Leon Cooperman, the Chairman and CEO of investment advisory firm Omega Advisors, is a titan of the hedge fund industry. The billionaire money manager rose from humble beginnings in the Bronx to become the leader of Goldman Sachs’ asset management division.

Cooperman retired in 1991 after 25 years with the company to launch his own hedge fund, the main fund of which generated annualized returns of 12.4% from inception through mid-2018, beating the S&P 500 by an average of about 2.9 percentage points annually during that period. Tired of chasing said S&P, Cooperman converted the fund into a family office at the end of 2018.

The 77-year-old Cooperman remains a prominent and respected figure in the finance world, being consulted regularly on CNBC and other media outlets and hasn’t shied away from making bold predictions in the coronavirus era. Best Finance Stocks To Buy Now Leon Cooperman Omega Advisors

In a May interview on The Reopening podcast, Cooperman stated that capitalism was likely to be changed forever given the widespread government intervention in the economy during the pandemic, saying that if the government will protect us from that kind of downside risk, then it likewise has the right to regulate the upside. In that same vein, he suggested taxes will continue to climb higher as America shifts further to the left, especially if Biden won the presidency, which was eventually the case.

Cooperman further suggested that the stock market is now more expensive than credit, and stated later in a separate interview on CNBC that the market’s rapid growth from its pandemic lows has likely come at the expense of future gains, predicting that returns are likely to be “relatively unimpressive for a long time”.

Not all richly valued stocks are created equal however, as Cooperman noted during a September RealVision interview that tech giants Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), were not expensive given interest rates.

Cooperman held all four of those stocks in his highly concentrated 13F portfolio as of September 30, though it was finance sector stocks that had the heaviest weighting in that portfolio at about 31%. We’ll take a look at the billionaire investing legend’s ten favorite finance stocks below.

Hedge funds’ reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. That doesn’t mean there isn’t money to be made off their consensus stock picks. Our research has shown that hedge funds’ small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 66 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Now then, let’s check out the 10 Best Finance Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Leon Cooperman. Note that all hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 800+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey as part of our market-beating investment strategy.

10. Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:AC)

We begin with Associated Capital Group, Inc. (NYSE:AC), which Leon Cooperman owned 8,600 shares of at the end of Q3, selling off 43 of them during the quarter. It’s the first of two stocks on this list with direct hedge fund ties, as Associated Capital was spun off from Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO in 2015.

AC is somewhat of an interesting pick of Cooperman’s given that it aims to use its capital in pursuit of private equity and late stage venture capital. Cooperman took a shot at the former last year, calling private equity a “scam” during an investment event in September and warning that the industry’s returns would evaporate as interest rates rose (which of course hasn’t happened).

Associated Capital managed $1.25 billion in assets at the end of Q3, down from $1.65 billion a year earlier. The investment manager’s Q3 revenue likewise declined to $1.95 million, down from $2.75 million in 2019, though its diluted net income per share held steady at $0.26.

9. Falcon Minerals Corporation (NASDAQ:FLMN)

FLMN ranks 9th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. Leon Cooperman has owned a stake in Falcon Minerals Corporation (NASDAQ:FLMN) since the middle of 2019 and boosted that position by 245,648 shares in Q3. 20 hedge funds were long FLMN on September 30.

Cooperman revealed on CNBC in March that he was bullish on energy-related companies, expecting oil prices to rebound. Falcon Minerals is generally considered an energy company given its assets are all oil and gas related, but it’s also akin to a finance company given that it’s not involved in the production side of its assets (and thus has no capex requirements) and that its core strategy is to return the vast majority of its high-margin cash flow to investors through dividends.

Falcon Minerals owns 256,000 gross unit acres with over 3,000 potential drilling locations in the Eagle Ford Shale, as well as royalty assets covering 68,000 gross unit acres in the Marcellus Shale. Falcon generated pro forma free cash flow of $0.07 per share during Q3 and raised its quarterly dividend by 117% to $0.065 per share, returning 93% of that cash flow to investors.

8. First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCRD)

FCRD ranks 8th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. Cooperman made a large investment in First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCRD) during Q3, buying 2.68 million shares to build a 9.5% ownership stake in the business development company, which is a separate, publicly traded division of First Eagle Investment Management.

FCRD has a portfolio of assets primarily comprised of 1st lien senior secured debt in middle market companies across a wide range of industries. The company earned $3.2 million in net investment income during Q3, down from $6.9 million a year earlier, declines which were attributed to portfolio contraction and an increase in non-accrual (unpaid) status loans.

The BDC was forced to slash its quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.10 earlier this year, though as the stock has cratered by 43% in 2020, shares still yield a hefty 11.08%.

7. MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC)

MVC ranks 7th in our list of the 10 best finance stocks to buy now. MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC) represents one of the oldest holdings in Leon Cooperman’s portfolio, dating back to early 2015. He owned 1.70 million shares of the business development company on September 30, unchanged throughout the third quarter.

In August, MVC Capital entered into a merger agreement with Barings BDC in a deal valued at approximately $177.5 million in cash and stock for MVC shareholders. Cooperman expressed his satisfaction with the deal and entered into a voting agreement that will see him vote his shares in favor of the transaction.

“We are pleased with the result and thank the board of MVC Capital for its hard work and success in delivering an excellent outcome for shareholders. We believe this transaction represents strong shareholder alignment and provides the best path forward,” Cooperman said.

The combined company will have more than $1.2 billion of pro forma investments and is estimated to earn net investment income of as much as $0.20 per share in the first full quarter following the deal’s completion, which was expected to occur during the current quarter.

6. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) rounds out the first half of the list of Leon Cooperman’s top finance stock picks, with the billionaire maintaining his 370,000-share position in the company, which ranks as one of the 10 Best Bank Stocks To Buy Right Now.

189,2020-12-22T14:00:00+00:00,"CEOs of Zoom, Microsoft, NexTech AR, 8X8 and RingCentral discuss 2020’s communication revolution","New York , Dec.  22, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tech Capital, the trusted source of technology news and analysis, is highlighting recent comments from CEOs of Zoom, Microsoft, NexTech AR Solutions, 8X8 Inc and RingCentral discussing the revolution in communication that has taken place in 2020.

Web-based video conferencing software has transformed the workplace, while innovation in the field of virtual and augmented reality (AR/VR) is doing the same for e-commerce, education and events.

Global spending on AR and VR is predicted to hit almost $73 billion by 2024, according to the International Data Corporation. This represents a five-year compound annual growth rate of 54%. “2020 has become a major turning point where enterprises and organizations across all verticals are embracing the unarticulated need for augmented, mixed, and virtual reality,” the IDC report concludes.

Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) founder and chief executive officer Eric Yuan says people and organizations are “actively redefining and embracing new approaches”

“As remote work trends have accelerated during the pandemic, organizations have moved beyond addressing immediate business continuity needs to actively redefine and embracing new approaches to support a future of working anywhere, learning anywhere, and connecting anywhere. And we continued to see meaningful adoption of Zoom's video-first unified communication platform across industries and geographies.”

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) chief executive officer Satya Nadella on the “new virtual commute” and Teams in education and sport

“[The] new virtual commute gives structure to a remote workday with scheduled cognitive breathers, and Together Mode is helping employees at companies like Office Depot reduce video fatigue. More broadly, we are accelerating our innovation across Microsoft 365. New Microsoft Stream is the video platform for the enterprise, making it easy to create, share and discover videos at work.”

Nadella added…. “In education, nearly 270,000 institutions are using Teams to power remote learning and improve learning outcomes, including the University of Nottingham in the U.K., Morehouse College, the University of South Florida and some of the largest school districts in the United States like Miami-Dade County Public Schools. In sports, the NBA and NFL are reimagining the game-day experience for fans.”

NexTech AR Solutions Corp (CSE:NTAR) (OTCQB:NEXCF) CEO Evan Gappelberg on transforming the virtual exhibition space

NexTech AR has gone a step further than the two titans of video communications by rolling out virtual and augmented reality solutions for e-commerce, education, conferences and events. Last week it announced the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum had chosen the InfernoAR Experience platform to power the 2021 Virtual Convention + Expo in May 2021.

NexTech will be transforming virtual exhibitor booths into AR-backed experiences that, for the first time in the event’s history, will put large and complex technologies right in your pocket through a phone or mobile device. Speaker sessions, which will feature special guests and surprise experiences, will utilize multi-dimensional broadcast solutions instead of simple webcasts to engage attendees in discussions on how new components including AR and data are revolutionizing mining processes.

“We are excited that CIM selected Nextech to help the mining industry take the giant step into a new world of digitized education and experiences by using our cutting edge InfernoAR solutions,” said Evan Gappelberg, CEO of NexTech AR. “We will be transforming virtual exhibitor booths into AR-backed experiences that, for the first time in CIM event history, will put large and complex technologies right in your pocket through a phone or mobile device, which is huge.""

Gappelberg continued…. “Speaker sessions will feature special guests and surprise experiences and will utilize multi-dimensional broadcast solutions instead of simple webcasts to engage attendees in discussions on how new components including AR/AI and data are revolutionizing mining processes. He continues  “CIM is helping to change how mining professionals in even the most remote locations across the globe, gain access to new insights and solutions and we’re thrilled to help power that vision with our virtual experience platform.”

8x8 Inc (NYSE:EGHT) chief executive officer Dave Sipes: “The cloud and work from home are transforming business communication”

“The cloud and work-from-home are transforming business communications for every employee and customer touchpoint, and have become a critical focal point for building competitive advantage for businesses today. 8x8 is well positioned with its Open Communications Platform,  which provides a wide breadth of integrated communication tools to power businesses’ critical cloud communications needs. This company has the opportunity to be central to the transformation of work.”

RingCentral Inc (NYSE:RNG)  founder, chairman and chief executive officer Vlad Shmunis: “Cloud communication a core tenet for business continuity”

“With a substantial part of the global workforce continuing to work from home, we see that cloud communication solutions are becoming a core tenet of business continuity. RingCentral's importance to all customers for their communication and collaboration needs continues to increase. Leveraging these megatrends, we delivered a solid third quarter. We saw continued strong adoption of RingCentral as our customers are going through their digital transformation journeys, and the numbers are there to prove it.”

Shmunis on the new “hybrid world”…..“Covid has been a tailwind for us as legacy on-premise solutions are now simply inaccessible by most employees. But let's look ahead, in the post-COVID world, we don't expect things to go all the way back to the way they were at the end of 2019. Businesses are already planning for a hybrid world, where part of the workforce will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. RingCentral is uniquely positioned to address this new world of work via a differentiated ecosystem of strategic partnerships with major on-premise system vendors, as well as, a number of leading global carriers.

190,2020-12-22T10:49:47+00:00,Markets are moving away from a 'Darwinistic' phase: Morning Brief,"Tuesday, December 22, 2020

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe

Survival of the fittest should be a fading theme in 2021.

Here in the Morning Brief and on Yahoo Finance we’ve written a lot about various markets forecasts for 2021.

The Wall Street consensus says earnings should grow appreciably next year and stocks should continue to rise. The details might differ from firm to firm, but the broad outlines are nine-tenths the same.

And while Rich Bernstein, CEO and CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors, isn’t exactly zigging while the rest of the Street is zagging, we found his outlook offered a unique and helpful thematic frame on what the year and economic cycle ahead could have in store.

As Rich puts it to his clients: “Embrace the profits cycle.”

And the profits cycle tells you that as regimes change, what had been working tends to stop working while areas of the market that hadn’t been working should start finding a bid. Everything old is eventually new again. With the economy entering a phase where the profit cycle is rising, sectors of the market that had fallen out of favor should become more attractive as the economy and profits accelerate out of the pandemic. (Source: Richard Bernstein Advisors)

“The direction of the overall stock market in 2021 could be very misleading and could mask a significant shift in underlying market leadership,” Bernstein writes. “In other words, the stock market might do well or not, but the potential for a major shift in market leadership could present significant investment opportunities.”

Because while the pandemic and resulting economic fallout brought financial markets and the global economy to its knees, let us not forget the dynamics that were driving markets at the end of the last decade. Narrowing leadership amid a slowing profit cycle — which means market gains were driven by rising valuations not rising profits — helped fuel the first group of companies to attain market capitalizations north of $1 trillion.

The FAAMG stocks became the hot trade at the end of the last decade not because the acronym was catchy but because Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) were the companies with the strongest earnings growth.

Story continues

“When profits cycles decelerate, markets become ‘Darwinistic’ and survival of the fittest determines stock performance,” Bernstein writes. “Fewer and fewer companies can maintain their earnings growth as overall economic conditions worsen and investors gravitate toward a smaller universe of growing companies and bid up those companies’ valuations. Simply put, the price of earnings growth appreciates as growth itself becomes increasingly scarce.”

But with the economy coming out of recession, a new cycle of economic and profit growth begins. For Bernstein, this mean the trades that had fallen out of favor with investors should benefit next year while the sectors that had been most loved could take a step back.

And so in this case, big cap tech stocks could be shunned by investors like financials (XLF) and materials (XLB) enjoy the early stages of an economic upturn.

“The biggest story for 2021 might not be ‘the market,’ but rather a significant shift in market leadership and sector, style, and size performance that is currently unimaginable to many investors,” Bernstein writes.

“Innovation, disruption, intangible assets, and long time-horizon investing could give way to ugly cyclicals, unknown small caps, downtrodden value, real assets, and investors’ demand for immediate strong earnings growth.”

NIC is benefiting from the accelerating rate of digital governance and mix shift to SaaS. The company’s expanding customer base is a key catalyst. Moreover, new contract wins across the states of Iowa and Florida remain key catalysts.

Further, this Zacks Rank #1 company is benefiting from the continued momentum in COVID-19 testing based on partnerships with Impact Health and NEXT Marketing.

Markedly, NIC’s solutions are gaining huge traction as they are helping the general public tackle coronavirus-led disruptions. For instance, cash payment solution, CheckFreePay, is helping residents make their property tax payments in cash. Moreover, Alabama Department of Revenue is now accepting online appointments for a variety of services through TeleGov, a service offered by NIC in collaboration with Microsoft.

Additionally, NIC’s outdoor recreation platform is set to go live in Pennsylvania and Illinois in the first quarter of 2021.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2020 earnings is pegged at $1.02 per share, having been revised 34.2% upward in the past 60 days. For 2021, the consensus mark for earnings has moved up 13.2% to $1.03 per share over the same time frame.

Covetrus is riding on strong coronavirus-led demand for online solutions for veterinarian practice. This Zacks Rank #2 company is helping veterinarians expand their digital presence. Moreover, robust pet adoption and higher incremental spending on pet care bode well for the company.

Covetrus’ growth prospects in 2021 are likely to be driven by its solid prescription management business. The company’s investment in expanding pharmacy capacity and innovative solutions are major growth drivers. Moreover, the company’s improved financial condition allows it to invest in veterinary study groups, which is expected to boost customer relationship.

Moreover, Covetrus plans to reach prescription management to Australia and New Zealand in the second half of 2021. This is expected to boost international growth. Further, cost-containment initiatives, as reflected by Covetrus’ exit from the low-margin distribution business in France, are expected to boost profitability.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2020 earnings stands at 85 cents per share, up 11.8% in the past 60 days. The consensus mark for its 2021 earnings is pegged at 91 cents per share, having been revised upward by 15.2% over the same time frame.

J2 Global’s advertising business has low exposure to local, travel, food, automotive and industry verticals most affected by the coronavirus, which has been a positive for overall business. This along with healthy display business (almost 40% healthcare) is expected to continue to drive top-line growth.

Cloud Services is expected to benefit from the company’s growing privacy and corporate fax businesses. Moreover, the coronavirus-led work-from-home wave bodes well as J2 Global’s security, privacy and voice services are considered indispensable for a remote working set-up.

Further, J2 Global’s growth-by-acquisition policy holds promise. Strategic acquisitions have expanded the company’s customer base, provided access to new markets and widened product line-up. The latest RetailMeNot buyout is expected to strengthen J2 Global’s footprint in the affiliate commerce industry.

The consensus mark for its 2020 bottom line is pegged at $7.92 per share, up 8.8% in the past 60 days. For 2021, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 15.1% north to $8.69 per share over the same time frame.

194,2020-12-18T21:31:39+00:00,"Sony, Microsoft Offer Cyberpunk Refunds After Player Complaints","(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have taken unusual measures to appease customers unhappy with CD Projekt SA’s Cyberpunk 2077 game, which was released earlier this month and is riddled with bugs, especially in console versions.

For PlayStation players, Sony is offering full refunds for Cyberpunk 2077 and is removing the title, one of the year’s most highly anticipated gaming blockbusters, from the PlayStation Store. Microsoft is also offering refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, “to ensure that every player is able to get the experience they expect on Xbox.”

Sony’s radical move to pull the game “until further notice” came after the console version of Cyberpunk 2077 debuted Dec. 10, following several delays, to reviews calling out problems and an online outcry from players frustrated with its poor performance.

CD Projekt shares shed 12% in Warsaw Friday, erasing most of this year’s gains.

Warsaw-based developer CD Projekt -- best known for 2015’s The Witcher 3, part of a franchise that was turned into a successful Netflix Inc. series -- has offered refunds to any disappointed players, but Sony is going a step further by entirely removing the game from its store. Cyberpunk features Hollywood star Keanu Reeves as an in-game character and has used the actor as its most visible ambassador in the buildup to its release.

CD Projekt, whose shares have plunged 40% since Dec. 4, confirmed Sony’s decision in a regulatory statement. The studio said it was “working hard” to bring its game back to the PlayStation store and that it had discussions with Sony regarding a full refund for all gamers seeking one.

It said that “all copies, whether digital or physical, will continue to receive support and updates” to help fix the game’s teething problems.

Trigon analyst Kacper Kopron said Sony’s decision is one of “worst scenarios” for the company as PlayStation represents two-thirds of the console market. He expects the move may trim estimates for Cyberpunk console sales by 30% to 40%.

Story continues

Erste Group analyst Emil Poplawski cut his recommendation on CD Projekt’s shares to reduce from buy, setting a target price of 280.5 zloty. Analysts at MBank and VTB Capital expect the game to be restored to PlayStation’s store after larger fixes in early 2021.

On Monday, the developers posted a message on Twitter saying they “should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.” But the company had not cleared its offer of a refund with console manufacturers Sony or Microsoft Corp., both of which have stringent refund policies.

This week, many players who requested refunds found themselves out of luck. Sony said it was working to resolve issues with accessing the refund. Microsoft said it has granted refunds to the vast majority of customers who have requested one.

CD Projekt Chief Executive Officer Adam Kicinski was cited as saying by PAP news agency that the gaming studio isn’t currently holding talks with Microsoft about removing Cyberpunk from its Xbox store.

It’s rare for any title to be removed from stores so soon after release. Previous examples include Square Enix Holdings Co.’s Final Fantasy XIV, which was taken offline for an overhaul following its disastrous 2010 launch, and Amazon.com Inc.’s Crucible, yanked from PC stores earlier this year and subsequently canceled.

Cyberpunk’s developers faced intense public pressure to get the game out this year, rising to the level of death threats, as Senior Game Designer Andrzej Zawadzki tweeted in October. Six-day work weeks became the norm in the final months leading up to the eventual release, breaking with previous pledges from CD Projekt leaders that the company would avoid imposing a so-called crunch to hurry a game into existence through overtime.

The company has said it’s continuing work to rectify the issues players are encountering in Cyberpunk 2077 -- and its prior blockbuster, The Witcher 3, improved drastically after its release thanks to downloadable patches.

196,2020-12-18T14:12:03+00:00,Cyberpunk Fiasco Is Going to Make Gaming More Expensive,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Buying a video game these days often feels like flying with a budget airline. By the time you take into account expansion packs, loot boxes and online gaming fees, a game’s sticker price can end up being just a fraction of the ultimate cost.

That’s why game maker CD Projekt SA found a special place in the hearts of gaming enthusiasts. Unlike giant rivals Electronic Arts Inc., Activision Blizzard Inc. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., the Warsaw-based studio made most of its money the old-fashioned way: selling a game that you can fully enjoy without having to keep spending on it.

The strategy helped make its “The Witcher” series a hit — and get adapted into a Netflix show. Over the past five years, the Polish company’s shares jumped 1,800%.

Now the approach seems to have come unstuck.

The stock’s surge had also been driven by the breathless anticipation for “Cyberpunk 2077,” an action role-playing game starring Keanu Reeves that had secured eight million pre-orders. Released last week, players assume the role of an urban mercenary whose abilities are augmented by cyberware implants. But “Cyberpunk” has been beset by poor user reviews and technical glitches, particularly on Sony Corp.’s Playstation console and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

The extent of the problems prompted Sony to pull the game from its online store on Friday. CD Projekt shares fell as much as 22% on the news, extending the decline that investors have endured since Dec. 4. The company is now valued at 25 billion zlotys ($6.8 billion).

It’s a tough pill for gamers and shareholders alike to swallow. “Cyberpunk” was supposed to form the basis for new online services that could bring more predictable revenue. Such services currently account for just 8% of CD Projekt’s annual sales, which had been expected to jump more than fourfold to 2.8 billion zlotys this year. At EA, live services account for 51% of sales, while game purchases are less than 40%, giving the Redwood City, California-based giant more of a cushion should it mess up new title releases.

Story continues

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman estimates it will take CD Projekt three to six months to fix the snafus. Keeping its developers occupied with that could push back the rollout of live services and the recurring revenue they promise.

Unfortunately for gamers, the experience highlights why it’s important for studios to beef up those add-on offerings. If a new release goes wrong and fewer people end up buying the game, that has a bigger impact on earnings if the studio doesn’t have reliable income from live services. CD Projekt’s foul-up of “Cyberpunk 2077” means gaming investors won’t have much patience for the more straightforward sales strategy again.

Going the budget airline route and totting up additional costs is more likely to keep a studio flying high.

200,2020-12-17T07:25:40+00:00,PlayStation 5 Scalpers Use Bots to Hunt Down Scarce Consoles,"(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. has created one of the hottest gadgets of the year in the PlayStation 5, but its launch has been marred by scalpers who are buying up scarce supplies and threatening the long-term health of the company’s most important product.

Scalpers, who buy devices at retail and then resell at a higher price, have long been a challenge in the games business. But the problem is particularly acute this year because the coronavirus has squeezed production and pushed more console sales online -- where scalpers use sophisticated bots to buy up the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

Furious gamers are calling out resellers for charging $1,300 or $1,400, almost triple the retail price, on sites like eBay and Twitter. “This is a launch disaster,” one Twitter post declared, vowing not to cave to usurious prices. “Scalpers can keep them.”

The threat is that Sony’s struggles in the first weeks of the launch could hurt its ability to draw gamers and developers to the new platform, undermining profits for years to come. A console’s debut is supposed to set off a virtuous cycle of consumers rushing to buy the devices, while developers release games that capitalize on new graphics and processor capabilities, sending demand on both sides surging. Sony risks suffering the opposite.

“The PlayStation 5 could miss a critical chance to get into a good hardware-software upward spiral,” said Kazunori Ito of Morningstar Research. “The peak of the platform will likely be low and the platform’s total revenue earned won’t be as strong as we hoped for.”

The company’s share price rose 2.7% to a 19-year high on Wednesday amid undiminished and growing enthusiasm for gaming stocks that saw rival Nintendo Co. surge by 6.6%.

Scalpers deploy bots that constantly monitor online stores for changes in inventory and supplies, then automatically place orders and check out in seconds when devices become available. The technique is based on familiar web-crawling or scraping technology, but is specifically tailored for e-commerce and can sometimes jump to the front of order queues.

Story continues

“One bot preventative action we implemented just hours before the PlayStation 5 event on Nov. 25 blocked more than 20 million bot attempts within the first 30 minutes alone,” U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc. wrote in a statement Tuesday. The company is asking others in the retail industry to join it in lobbying lawmakers to address the bot issue.

Evidence of Sony’s trouble is clear in what’s known as the tie ratio, or the number of games sold for each console. A healthy ratio for a new console is around one, meaning each person who buys a machine also walks away with at least one game. The figure is important because the PlayStation 5 is sold at a loss, while games are lucrative.

So far, Sony appears to be seeing sales of about one game for every three devices -- compelling evidence scalpers are hoarding the consoles. First-month estimates from Japan’s Famitsu show Sony sold around 213,000 PlayStation 5 consoles in the country, while the top three titles sold less than 63,000, excluding digital downloads. Sony’s Spider-Man and Demon’s Souls were the top games, while the third was an outside software company. For comparison, Nintendo sold a half million Switch consoles in its first four weeks on the domestic market, and the top three titles accounted for roughly the same number.

“Even if we consider digital download software purchases, the percentage of sold PlayStation 5s actually in use is not that high, meaning the current demand is constrained by profit-taking resellers,” said Hideki Yasuda, analyst at Ace Research Institute. The PS5 is compatible with PlayStation 4 game and comes with Astro’s Playroom pre-installed, so players may not be immediately compelled to buy new titles.

Sony’s scalper headaches are aggravated by struggles in production. The company has said it aims to sell more than 7.6 million PlayStation 5s by the end of March, beating the previous-generation console’s performance.

But the pandemic has created shortages throughout the industry’s supply chain, crimping the ability of companies from Sony to Apple Inc. to ramp up output. Key suppliers, including MediaTek Inc., have said chip availability will be constrained through the first half of 2021. Strong demand from electric-vehicle makers, among others, has been consuming capacity for some parts used in the PS5, according to people familiar with its supply chain.

Of particular concern for Sony, production yields for the PS5’s main, custom-designed processor remain inconsistent and have hurt its ability to meet demand, said the people, asking not to be named because the details are private. The company may have to rely more on air freight to deliver consoles to retailers, cutting further into its profits, they said.

“By air is at least 10 times more expensive than by sea when the world is in a normal condition, and the gap is likely wider now,” said Yasuda of Ace Research.

Sony’s latest shipment forecast is still well above the 7.6 million mark, although not as high as it had targeted earlier, one of the people said.

Sony declined to comment specifically on production figures or scalpers.

“While we do not release details related to manufacturing, nothing unexpected has happened since PlayStation 5 mass production has started and we have not changed the production number for PS5,” a spokesman said.

Inadequate supply risks derailing the cycle of a successful console introduction, with new software titles that in turn catalyze hardware interest. One major Japanese publisher was sufficiently spooked by the early market response that it’s held internal discussions over whether to delay its PlayStation 5 games, according to a person familiar with the talks.

Retailers are taking extreme measures to stymie scalpers. GameStop Corp. didn’t tell its own staff about new console shipments to U.S. stores this week until an hour before arrival so real customers could buy them. In Japan, Nojima Corp. had workers manually review every purchase order to screen out scalpers. Yet resellers have already made about $35 million off of PlayStation and $24 million from the rival Xbox that launched at the same time, according to one estimate.

Many customers blame Sony for not doing more to boost supply -- and eliminate profits for scalpers.

“The real test for the PlayStation 5 is whether the hardware would continue to sell well even when there’s enough supply,” said games industry consultant Serkan Toto. “You need good games to convince gamers to switch over to the PlayStation 5, you need more outside publishers to release games on the PlayStation 5, and you need to ship more hardware.”

201,2020-12-17T07:25:40+00:00,PlayStation 5 Scalpers Use Bots to Hunt Down Scarce Consoles,"(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. has created one of the hottest gadgets of the year in the PlayStation 5, but its launch has been marred by scalpers who are buying up scarce supplies and threatening the long-term health of the company’s most important product.

Scalpers, who buy devices at retail and then resell at a higher price, have long been a challenge in the games business. But the problem is particularly acute this year because the coronavirus has squeezed production and pushed more console sales online -- where scalpers use sophisticated bots to buy up the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox.

Furious gamers are calling out resellers for charging $1,300 or $1,400, almost triple the retail price, on sites like eBay and Twitter. “This is a launch disaster,” one Twitter post declared, vowing not to cave to usurious prices. “Scalpers can keep them.”

The threat is that Sony’s struggles in the first weeks of the launch could hurt its ability to draw gamers and developers to the new platform, undermining profits for years to come. A console’s debut is supposed to set off a virtuous cycle of consumers rushing to buy the devices, while developers release games that capitalize on new graphics and processor capabilities, sending demand on both sides surging. Sony risks suffering the opposite.

“The PlayStation 5 could miss a critical chance to get into a good hardware-software upward spiral,” said Kazunori Ito of Morningstar Research. “The peak of the platform will likely be low and the platform’s total revenue earned won’t be as strong as we hoped for.”

The company’s share price rose 2.7% to a 19-year high on Wednesday amid undiminished and growing enthusiasm for gaming stocks that saw rival Nintendo Co. surge by 6.6%.

Scalpers deploy bots that constantly monitor online stores for changes in inventory and supplies, then automatically place orders and check out in seconds when devices become available. The technique is based on familiar web-crawling or scraping technology, but is specifically tailored for e-commerce and can sometimes jump to the front of order queues.

“One bot preventative action we implemented just hours before the PlayStation 5 event on Nov. 25 blocked more than 20 million bot attempts within the first 30 minutes alone,” U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc. wrote in a statement Tuesday. The company is asking others in the retail industry to join it in lobbying lawmakers to address the bot issue.

Evidence of Sony’s trouble is clear in what’s known as the tie ratio, or the number of games sold for each console. A healthy ratio for a new console is around one, meaning each person who buys a machine also walks away with at least one game. The figure is important because the PlayStation 5 is sold at a loss, while games are lucrative.

So far, Sony appears to be seeing sales of about one game for every three devices -- compelling evidence scalpers are hoarding the consoles. First-month estimates from Japan’s Famitsu show Sony sold around 213,000 PlayStation 5 consoles in the country, while the top three titles sold less than 63,000, excluding digital downloads. Sony’s Spider-Man and Demon’s Souls were the top games, while the third was an outside software company. For comparison, Nintendo sold a half million Switch consoles in its first four weeks on the domestic market, and the top three titles accounted for roughly the same number.

“Even if we consider digital download software purchases, the percentage of sold PlayStation 5s actually in use is not that high, meaning the current demand is constrained by profit-taking resellers,” said Hideki Yasuda, analyst at Ace Research Institute. The PS5 is compatible with PlayStation 4 game and comes with Astro’s Playroom pre-installed, so players may not be immediately compelled to buy new titles.

Sony’s scalper headaches are aggravated by struggles in production. The company has said it aims to sell more than 7.6 million PlayStation 5s by the end of March, beating the previous-generation console’s performance.

But the pandemic has created shortages throughout the industry’s supply chain, crimping the ability of companies from Sony to Apple Inc. to ramp up output. Key suppliers, including MediaTek Inc., have said chip availability will be constrained through the first half of 2021. Strong demand from electric-vehicle makers, among others, has been consuming capacity for some parts used in the PS5, according to people familiar with its supply chain.

Of particular concern for Sony, production yields for the PS5’s main, custom-designed processor remain inconsistent and have hurt its ability to meet demand, said the people, asking not to be named because the details are private. The company may have to rely more on air freight to deliver consoles to retailers, cutting further into its profits, they said.

“By air is at least 10 times more expensive than by sea when the world is in a normal condition, and the gap is likely wider now,” said Yasuda of Ace Research.

Sony’s latest shipment forecast is still well above the 7.6 million mark, although not as high as it had targeted earlier, one of the people said.

Sony declined to comment specifically on production figures or scalpers.

“While we do not release details related to manufacturing, nothing unexpected has happened since PlayStation 5 mass production has started and we have not changed the production number for PS5,” a spokesman said.

Inadequate supply risks derailing the cycle of a successful console introduction, with new software titles that in turn catalyze hardware interest. One major Japanese publisher was sufficiently spooked by the early market response that it’s held internal discussions over whether to delay its PlayStation 5 games, according to a person familiar with the talks.

Retailers are taking extreme measures to stymie scalpers. GameStop Corp. didn’t tell its own staff about new console shipments to U.S. stores this week until an hour before arrival so real customers could buy them. In Japan, Nojima Corp. had workers manually review every purchase order to screen out scalpers. Yet resellers have already made about $35 million off of PlayStation and $24 million from the rival Xbox that launched at the same time, according to one estimate.

Many customers blame Sony for not doing more to boost supply -- and eliminate profits for scalpers.

“The real test for the PlayStation 5 is whether the hardware would continue to sell well even when there’s enough supply,” said games industry consultant Serkan Toto. “You need good games to convince gamers to switch over to the PlayStation 5, you need more outside publishers to release games on the PlayStation 5, and you need to ship more hardware.”

202,2020-12-17T06:33:58+00:00,Nintendo and Sony Shares Hit Records as Peak Holiday Season Approaches,"(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. had its biggest gain in more than a year in Tokyo on Thursday, as investors eyed demand for game consoles with the peak holiday season approaching.

Shares in the Kyoto-based gamemaker rose 6.6%, reaching the highest level since December 2007, amid demand for its Switch console and a broader buying of Japanese gaming stocks. Sony Corp., which recently released its PlayStation 5 console, also reached a record, surpassing the 10,000 yen per share mark for the first time since 2001.

“Investors have their attention toward game makers amid the recent coronavirus spread and the upcoming Christmas season,” said Ryuta Otsuka, a strategist at Toyo Securities Co.

Videogame makers have gained almost across the board from the surge in stay-at-home stocks this year, with gaming a chief beneficiary of changing customer habits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Software makers Capcom Co. and Koei Tecmo Holdings Co. both hit new highs in Tokyo Thursday.

Combined hardware and software sales in the home console market in Japan rose 5.5% in November compared with the same month in 2019, SMBC Nikko analyst Eiji Maeda wrote in a note on Monday. Coronavirus cases in Japan began to increase during that month, when the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp.’s latest Xbox console were also both released. Tokyo was set to report a record 800 coronavirus cases on Thursday, local broadcaster NHK said.

206,2020-12-15T19:42:46+00:00,20 stocks ripe to surge in 2021 because of 3 big tech trends: analyst,"Per the usual, it has been a year of twists and turns for the tech sector.

Companies such as Zoom (Yahoo Finance Company of the Year) and Slack (which will soon be part of Salesforce) have become household names and vital communication tools with people stuck inside during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for notebook computers has gone through the roof with employees working from home, benefiting companies like Dell and HP. The shift to the cloud has only accelerated this year in large part because of the health crisis, lifting the financial fortunes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

And of course, a year of tech wouldn’t be a year of tech if lawmakers weren’t attacking the powers of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon (notably the two former names).

Tech watchers on Wall Street expect a lot of the same trends that lifted the bottom lines — and stock prices — of so many companies to remain intact for 2021. But Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin says three tech trends in particular stand out as potential money-making opportunities even with valuations looking rich.

“Despite increasing risk of a cyclical rotation pressuring tech multiples next year, we remain bullish on the 3-5 year growth prospects for digital darlings. We have a positive bias on software and internet entering 2021 but would not sleep on semiconductors that could have a banner year,” Bracelin wrote in a new note.

Here are three of Bracelin’s key tech trends and potential stock winners.

Theme 1: Digital awakening

Winners: Lemonade; Twilio; Unity Software; nCino; Avalara; Chegg; Zoominfo; Asana, Slack

Bracelin thinks the ongoing shift to the cloud will be a strong growth driver for numerous tech companies next year. He believes enterprises are having a “digital awakening,” as executives realize they haven’t spent enough on the cloud in the lead-up to the pandemic and must now play catch up in order to satisfy new demands in the business.

“The first and most significant thematic that was reinforced by our latest CIO survey was the premise that cloud and digital adoption at 10% of enterprise and 15% of consumer spend entering 2020 would continue to accelerate post pandemic into 2021-2022,” he wrote.

“A key dynamic playing out in the tech world over the next 12 to 18 months is the secular growth areas around cloud and cybersecurity that are seeing eye popping demand trends we have not witnessed in our 20+ years of covering tech stocks on the Street. The accelerated path to the cloud and work from home environment is unprecedented as enterprises and governments of all shapes and sizes adjust to a more virtual workforce for the foreseeable future,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives says.

Theme 2: Cloud plus pay

Winners: Bill.com Holdings; BigCommerce Holdings; Shopify; Coupa Software; Tyler Technologies; Ceridian; Intuit; Workday

The digital payments shift is moving beyond the consumer-focused names such as PayPal to enterprises, Bracelin contends. That opens the door for more tech companies to participate in the digital flow of transactions. Bracelin calls this the ‘cloud plus pay’ investing theme.

“The second biggest thematic we are focused on is the rise of business-to-business payments. We see a new class of software-as-a-service models proliferating in 2021 that augment high margin subscription revenue base with new digital payment streams that can help accelerate growth and profitability,” Bracelin says.

The CEO of Intuit (one of Bracelin’s winners) Sasan Goodarzi recently struck an upbeat tone on his business headed into 2021 in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, fueled in part by its $8.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma. It looks like Bracelin may be on the mark, at least when it comes to Intuit.

Theme 3: Digital exhaust

Winners: Snowflake; MongoDB; Alteryx

Bracelin’s “digital exhaust” theme is probably the most emerging one of the three he discusses. But, the underlying drivers of the theme partially explains the impressive response to data cloud play Snowflake’s IPO this year.

“The third thematic that we’re focused on is a byproduct of the accelerating shift to digital and cloud, which is digital exhaust. The vast majority of information created (97%) has historically been stored, processed, or archived. As new mountains of digital exhaust are created, we expect AI will have an increasingly critical role and an entirely new crop of digital disruptors that help convert digital exhaust into actionable insights in real-time,” explains Bracelin.

To this end, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman recently told Yahoo Finance Live his emerging technology is now mission critical for businesses.

“Snowflake is 100% essential, and I am not just saying that because we are Snowflake,” Slootman told Yahoo Finance Live. “If you look at the history of cloud computing, the data later is crucial and essential.”

208,2020-12-11T06:29:32+00:00,"Handed a 5G Lifeline by Trump, Japan Races to Catch Up to Huawei","(Bloomberg) -- When Japan invented the world’s first camera-equipped mobile phone two decades ago, it signaled an early but crucial step in the transformation of the phone into a sophisticated high-speed wireless information terminal.

Two decades later, as the world develops 5G networks that are tens of thousands of times faster, the nation that pioneered many of these technologies has been almost entirely absent. Having lost the lead in consumer-facing handsets after missing the shift to smartphones, Japanese brands have also fallen behind Nokia Oyj, Ericsson AB and above all Huawei Technologies Co. in the buildout of 5G infrastructure.

Those three manufacturers control almost 80% of 5G base-station market share, according to research company TrendForce. But Japanese firms have been handed an unexpected lifeline by the U.S.-led crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese company that was at the forefront of the technology’s rollout. With U.S. partners seeking out suppliers from friendlier nations, vendors in close U.S. ally Japan suddenly seem a lot more attractive to carriers around the world racing to upgrade their networks.

“It’s given us a chance,” Jun Sawada, chief executive officer of Japan’s telecommunications behemoth Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., also known as NTT, said of the U.S. steps to remove Huawei.

The 5G opportunity could help the likes of NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and other network equipment makers make fresh inroads in a global supply chain that’s only set to grow. Recognizing this, the government has also thrown its weight behind the effort, offering hundreds of millions of dollars in support earlier this year to the nation’s few remaining suppliers to build 5G and post-5G technologies.

Since coming to power in September, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s administration has furthered this charge, jumping on the sector as one of its pillars for growth.

“In order to take a global lead in next-generation technology including post-5G and 6G, the government will lead the charge of research and development,” Suga said at a press conference on Friday, announcing more than 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) in spending in an upcoming extra budget for technologies including wireless.

Story continues

Having banned installation of Huawei 5G equipment from next September, the U.K. is already soliciting NEC and Fujitsu, as well as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., to assist with its 5G roll-out. NTT in June agreed to acquire a 5% stake in NEC, partnering to jointly develop 5G technologies.

In a report on U.K. supply chains last month, U.K. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden noted that the decision to remove Huawei would leave the country entirely reliant on just two suppliers, Nokia and Ericsson, to supply critical 5G infrastructure.

“This represents an intolerable resilience risk,” Dowden wrote. The strategy lays out a plan to attract new suppliers and support incumbents so that the nation is “not reliant on any single vendor.”

Shares in NEC have risen about 19% this year, while Fujitsu has added almost 35%, although the gains are largely supported by expectations for their role in Suga’s plans for a digital transformation of Japan’s public sector.

Open Model

Japan’s early attempts to dominate the mobile Internet space failed miserably, with NTT unit NTT Docomo Inc.’s own tightly-controlled I-mode Internet access service unable to catch on in an era of open Internet standards. From Betamax to Blu-Ray, Japanese firms have rarely been associated with promoting open platforms, but are now embracing the concept as they look to cover lost ground amid Huawei’s challenges.

NTT Docomo is one of the founding members of the O-RAN Alliance, a group that is pushing for open radio access networks (RAN) — a crucial part of telecoms infrastructure that connects users’ devices to the broader network.

Traditionally, vendors would supply the RAN and core network together, and as networks became more complex, only the biggest vendors could supply the entire bundle. That advantage accrued for the likes of Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei.

“From the perspective of the carriers, hiring Huawei is easy,” explains Sawada, who spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this year. “They’ll do everything for you.”

He likened this vertically-integrated approach to that taken by Apple Inc. as compared to Microsoft in PCs or Google in smartphones. The open model aims to break this down and provides opportunities to smaller makers.

“The concept of O-RAN is fine, but Nokia and Ericsson won’t simply stay quiet and stand by,” said Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities Co. “They may come after the O-RAN alliance with price cuts.”

‘Big Chance’

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has campaigned against Huawei’s involvement in 5G networks since 2018, urging its allies to boycott the company’s 5G equipment. Japan has a harder needle to thread than some others, dependent on the U.S. for its national security but also seeking to improve relations with its top trading partner. It’s a tension that Sawada acknowledges.

“China and the U.S. are both strong countries,” he said. “The worst thing that could happen for Japan is for them to work together.”

Rakuten Inc., the Japanese e-commerce giant that is building out its mobile phone network in Japan to challenge the long-term incumbents, has embraced O-RAN for its 4G and 5G networks. Founder and CEO Hiroshi Mikitani told a conference in November that he aims to export its network technology overseas and sees its value “easily exceeding 1 trillion yen.”

The open model is also seen bolstering the negotiating position of carriers in contracts for 5G network buildouts, with telcos able to choose from a wide range of suppliers. It also provides opportunities to system integration providers, which Japan’s firms excel at.

“Pursuing this open model which increases competition and seeing how much we can gain is a big challenge for us,” said Takahito Tokita, Fujitsu’s CEO. Earlier this year, Fujitsu sealed a deal to sell 5G technology to Dish Network Corp., which is building out its own network having acquired the Boost wireless business from T-Mobile US Inc.

“This is a multitrillion-dollar market,” he told Bloomberg News. “Even a small percentage of that is a big chance for us,” he said, adding that Fujitsu is still no more than a “newborn chick” compared to the likes of Nokia.

Japan’s firms were once spoken of in western circles in a similar way to China’s are now, working too closely with the central government and benefiting from unfair competitive advantages. But much has changed in Japanese business since that first camera phone was rolled out — with its maker Sharp Corp. now itself owned by a Taiwanese firm, something almost unthinkable just a decade ago. The 5G era and beyond could show its firms how to fight larger competitors with a more open approach.

209,2020-12-11T06:29:32+00:00,"Handed a 5G Lifeline by Trump, Japan Races to Catch Up to Huawei","(Bloomberg) -- When Japan invented the world’s first camera-equipped mobile phone two decades ago, it signaled an early but crucial step in the transformation of the phone into a sophisticated high-speed wireless information terminal.

Two decades later, as the world develops 5G networks that are tens of thousands of times faster, the nation that pioneered many of these technologies has been almost entirely absent. Having lost the lead in consumer-facing handsets after missing the shift to smartphones, Japanese brands have also fallen behind Nokia Oyj, Ericsson AB and above all Huawei Technologies Co. in the buildout of 5G infrastructure.

Those three manufacturers control almost 80% of 5G base-station market share, according to research company TrendForce. But Japanese firms have been handed an unexpected lifeline by the U.S.-led crackdown on Huawei, the Chinese company that was at the forefront of the technology’s rollout. With U.S. partners seeking out suppliers from friendlier nations, vendors in close U.S. ally Japan suddenly seem a lot more attractive to carriers around the world racing to upgrade their networks.

“It’s given us a chance,” Jun Sawada, chief executive officer of Japan’s telecommunications behemoth Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., also known as NTT, said of the U.S. steps to remove Huawei.

The 5G opportunity could help the likes of NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and other network equipment makers make fresh inroads in a global supply chain that’s only set to grow. Recognizing this, the government has also thrown its weight behind the effort, offering hundreds of millions of dollars in support earlier this year to the nation’s few remaining suppliers to build 5G and post-5G technologies.

Since coming to power in September, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s administration has furthered this charge, jumping on the sector as one of its pillars for growth.

“In order to take a global lead in next-generation technology including post-5G and 6G, the government will lead the charge of research and development,” Suga said at a press conference on Friday, announcing more than 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) in spending in an upcoming extra budget for technologies including wireless.

Story continues

Having banned installation of Huawei 5G equipment from next September, the U.K. is already soliciting NEC and Fujitsu, as well as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., to assist with its 5G roll-out. NTT in June agreed to acquire a 5% stake in NEC, partnering to jointly develop 5G technologies.

In a report on U.K. supply chains last month, U.K. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden noted that the decision to remove Huawei would leave the country entirely reliant on just two suppliers, Nokia and Ericsson, to supply critical 5G infrastructure.

“This represents an intolerable resilience risk,” Dowden wrote. The strategy lays out a plan to attract new suppliers and support incumbents so that the nation is “not reliant on any single vendor.”

Shares in NEC have risen about 19% this year, while Fujitsu has added almost 35%, although the gains are largely supported by expectations for their role in Suga’s plans for a digital transformation of Japan’s public sector.

Open Model

Japan’s early attempts to dominate the mobile Internet space failed miserably, with NTT unit NTT Docomo Inc.’s own tightly-controlled I-mode Internet access service unable to catch on in an era of open Internet standards. From Betamax to Blu-Ray, Japanese firms have rarely been associated with promoting open platforms, but are now embracing the concept as they look to cover lost ground amid Huawei’s challenges.

NTT Docomo is one of the founding members of the O-RAN Alliance, a group that is pushing for open radio access networks (RAN) — a crucial part of telecoms infrastructure that connects users’ devices to the broader network.

Traditionally, vendors would supply the RAN and core network together, and as networks became more complex, only the biggest vendors could supply the entire bundle. That advantage accrued for the likes of Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei.

“From the perspective of the carriers, hiring Huawei is easy,” explains Sawada, who spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this year. “They’ll do everything for you.”

He likened this vertically-integrated approach to that taken by Apple Inc. as compared to Microsoft in PCs or Google in smartphones. The open model aims to break this down and provides opportunities to smaller makers.

“The concept of O-RAN is fine, but Nokia and Ericsson won’t simply stay quiet and stand by,” said Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities Co. “They may come after the O-RAN alliance with price cuts.”

The guru's Chicago-based firm invests in undervalued small and mid-cap companies that have sustainable competitive advantages, high barriers to entry and predictable fundamentals that allow for double-digit earnings growth. Like the tortoise featured in the firm's logo, Rogers emphasizes that patience, independent thinking and a long-term outlook are necessary for generating good returns.

According to GuruFocus Real-Time Picks, a Premium feature, the firm increased is holding in Core Laboratories by 43.8% and its Madison Square Garden position by 25.07% on Nov. 30.

Core Laboratories

With an impact of 0.44% on the equity portfolio, Ariel invested in 1.4 million shares of Core Laboratories. During the quarter, the stock traded for an average price of $21.97 per share.

The firm now holds 4.6 million shares total, which represent 1.45% of the equity portfolio. GuruFocus estimates the firm has gained 3.24% on the investment since establishing it in the second quarter. John Rogers' Firm Ups Stakes in 2 Companies

""In response, CLB is executing on prudent enhancements to the existing cost reduction plan, which include limiting cash outflows to achieve its free cash flow targets and reducing debt levels. Looking ahead, we believe the headwinds this asset-light business is experiencing will soften and expect CLB to experience modest growth in reservoir description. We also think CLB will see increased activity in fracturing rock, which should increase output in well completions and fuel longer term growth of the production enhancement sector.""

GuruFocus rated Core Laboratories' financial strength 3 out of 10. As a result of issuing approximately $31 million in new long-term debt over the past three years, the company has weak interest coverage. The Altman Z-Score of 1.95 also indicates the company is under some pressure. The return on invested capital is also being eclipsed by the weighted average cost of capital, indicating struggles with creating value.

The company's profitability fared better, scoring a 7 out of 10 rating even though the operating margin is in decline and its returns are negative and underperform a majority of competitors. Core Laboratories also has a low Piotroski F-Score of 3, which implies business conditions are in poor shape. As a result of revenue per share declining over the past five years, the company's predictability rank of one out of five stars is on watch. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return an average of 1.1% annually over a 10-year period.

Of the gurus invested in Core Laboratories, Rogers' firm has the largest stake with 10.28% of outstanding shares. Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), Mairs and Power (Trades, Portfolio), Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) also own the stock.

It also cancelled its long-running Christmas show that features the Radio City Rockettes. Regardless, the firm says Madison Square Garden Entertainment ""has ample liquidity to withstand the challenging operating environment until event attendance normalizes.""

Madison Square Garden's financial strength was rated 6 out of 10 by GuruFocus on the back of a stable cash-to-debt ratio of 3.86. The Altman Z-Score of 1.83, however, indicates it is under some pressure since revenue per share has declined over the past 12 months.

Weighed down by negative margins and returns that underperform industry peers, the company's profitability scored a 1 out of 10 rating.

With a 8.28% stake, Rogers' firm is Madison Square Garden's largest guru shareholder. Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio), Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio), Murray Stahl (Trades, Portfolio), Howard Marks (Trades, Portfolio), Michael Price (Trades, Portfolio), Prem Watsa (Trades, Portfolio) and Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio) also have positions in the stock.

What Happened: An official news release on Microsoft’s website explains that the strategic collaboration hopes to speed up cloud adoption and promote Microsoft 365 and Azure as the preferred cloud platform for Deutsche Telekom IT subsidiary, T-Systems.

The efforts will combine Microsoft’s Cloud and AI solutions with Deutsche Telekom’s cloud migration framework and telecommunication services.

Deutsche Telekom has also agreed to offer the Microsoft Teams communication platform and the Office 365 tools to educational institutes to enhance remote interactions.

Deutsche Telekom also plans to use Azure ExpressRoute for bypassing the public internet and speed up customer connectivity.

Both companies will collectively address the regulatory needs and compliance standards set by the European authorities.

Why Does It Matter: Introducing the concept of cloud-based mainframes could enhance the energy efficiency, scalability of operations, and business continuity without the need for additional operational expenses or hardware costs.

Deutsche Telekom is already relying on Azure to achieve its 2025 public cloud migration targets, and its employees are being engaged in training programs for Microsoft’s cloud services platform.

Microsoft anticipates small and mid-sized businesses to benefit by adopting these cloud initiatives.

The current agreement is an expansion of the partnership originally started in 2018 between Microsoft and T-Systems. At the time, the focus was on the Internet of Things and networking using connected devices.

214,2020-12-09T19:41:42+00:00,"Microsoft, Unilever Join Amazon Vow to Fight Climate Change","(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has added a competitor to its year-old coalition of companies pledging to reduce their contribution to climate change: Microsoft Corp.

The two technology giants, neighbors in the Seattle area and rivals in cloud computing and business software, have each spent much of the last two years announcing increasingly aggressive climate targets, including dueling umbrella organizations for companies willing to do their part to avert the catastrophic warming of the planet. On Wednesday, Microsoft said it had signed onto Amazon’s pact, alongside consumer products giant Unilever Plc and several other new signatories.

Amazon, long a laggard among its peers in publicly addressing its impact on the environment, reversed course in recent years, bolstering an internal sustainability team and vowing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. The company also invited others interested in matching that commitment to sign on to what it calls the Climate Pledge, a forum for comparing notes on best practices and climate-friendly investment opportunities.

Microsoft, meanwhile, has said it hopes to use new technologies to remove from the atmosphere all of the greenhouse gases the company was responsible for generating during its entire existence.

Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s Chief Environmental Officer, said the software maker’s previous pledges already more than meet the Climate Pledge standard, but it’s important to send a signal with participation in Amazon’s effort, particularly because less than 5% of Fortune 500 companies have promised to get to net-zero emissions.

“There’s been this false perception that there is this kind of climate race,” he said. “There is a climate race, but it’s not between tech companies, it’s between every company and society and time.”

The other new Climate Pledgers make for an eclectic mix. Coca-Cola European Partners, the largest Coca-Cola bottler by revenue, joined. So did Harbour Air Ltd., a tour and charter float plane company based near Vancouver, Canada. (Business boosters have long pushed for more frequent routes between Vancouver and Seattle.)

And Neste Oyj, a Finnish state-backed oil refiner making a push into renewable energy, became the first signatory that does the bulk of its business in the fossil fuels industry.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you about another power center in America, Michael, which kind of concerns our audience maybe more directly, and you alluded to this, which is corporate America. And, you know, this is tricky stuff because people have good intentions here and there is some action, but I'd love to get your assessment of corporate America's responses in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing.

MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: Well, look, it was great in terms of the immediate aftermath. You know, like hey, this is powerful. You know, we got more monies to develop toward people being brought in. We want to be more diverse. We want to see a broader swath of the universe participate. All that stuff is great.

But, you know, when you get down to brass tacks and knuckles, how are you changing your process? Who are your VPs? Who are the people in the room? Who are the people who can green light projects? Who are the people who can have real resources behind your intent to do well?

So at that level, it means you've got to restructure, rejigger what's going on. It can't just be surface or cosmetic. It's got to be more internal. The skeletons, the bones have to be readjusted so that the flesh that is put upon them can look a bit different.

And so corporate America has to ask, how are you making so much money at the expense of these very Black people who are dying and all you're giving back is a small sliver, a small percentage? Because be rest assured what the corporations are doing in response to Black Lives Matter and saying we're going to pledge money is barely anything in compensation for the amounts of money that Black people put into their pockets, right, across the board.

And so that recognition means you got to do a little bit more, whether you're a sports league or whether you are a, you know, financial-services business or whether you're with clothes or shoes or entertainment. Black folk are sustaining you in far higher numbers than you're willing to pay back or give back or recognize in your bottom-line budgets for Black Lives Matter.

So again, Martin Luther King Jr. said, yo, the civil rights bill didn't cost you nothing. Voting rights, that ain't costing you nothing. What I'm asking for now, economic parity, you don't deal with that. And in an aftermath of his death, housing-- the housing fair act-- the fair act for housing passed, right, '68. That cost something. That means you've got to give up your rapacious, you know, individualism or your rapacious corporate practices when it comes to real-estate companies that are redlining and directing Black people towards certain neighborhoods and ripping them off and taking their money without giving them the bang on their buck.

So all that stuff means it costs something. And until it costs you something as corporate America, you really ain't doing anything to make a difference in terms of race in America.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/corporate-america-truly-addressing-racial-110000310.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'BRK-A.US', 'BRK-B.US', 'C-PIC.US', 'C-PJ.US', 'C-PK.US', 'C-PS.US', 'C.US', 'GS-PA.US', 'GS-PD.US', 'GS-PJ.US', 'GS-PK.US', 'GS-PN.US', 'GS.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'HD.US', 'JNJ.US', 'JPM-PC.US', 'JPM-PD.US']","['AMERICA', 'CORPORATE AMERICA', 'MICHAEL ERIC DYSON']","{'polarity': 0.988, 'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.092}"

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- This past year, almost every student in America from preschool to graduate school has been camping out online, as the outbreak of the coronavirus has forced their schools to close. Zoom has been the key ingredient that has allowed education to continue. It could even be argued that no one company was better positioned, more capable, and more ready for a world that has been hit with a pandemic. Since March, the San Jose-based company has found itself in prime demand, as school districts and universities turn to remote learning. But providing a platform for K to 12 wasn't an easy period for the company.

JANINE PELOSI: I think it's important to note that universities in the higher education space were some of actually the earliest adopters of Zoom. So we've been in the classroom, we've been in the operations of the schools for many, many years. The need for the K through 12 environment globally is absolutely something at this scale that is unprecedented.

- Pelosi says the company adapted some of its offerings to fit the K to 12 environment better. For instance, the company removed time limits on its platform for 125,000 schools across the world.

JANINE PELOSI: We do really believe that it is important that we have that access as a global community. And you know, we've really, really done our best to ensure that the product is going to work for those use cases.

- But remote learning hasn't been such a wild success for everyone. For instance, when universities were forced to take their spring semester online, it was a struggle for many college students. Those without stable internet access at home were effectively cut off.

According to one report by Education Trust-West, the shift to online in the spring was quote, ""extremely disruptive for students of color and those from low-income households."" About 13% of students of color and 14% of students from low-income households just in California alone lacked basic internet access. And it's not just students who are finding it hard to stay connected and motivated; this new phenomenon, called Zoom fatigue, has also been affecting teachers.

JENNA SHEFFIELD: All of us in higher ed are experiencing Zoom fatigue, and I think it extends to the students and the faculty and the administrators. Part of it is that there's no time to decompress.

- But as we consider a world beyond the pandemic, there is one big question that remains-- will Zoom continue to dominate education? We'll just have to wait and see.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/company-zoom-changed-u-education-090000034.html?.tsrc=rss,"['BABA.US', 'BABAF.US', 'CSCO.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'ORCL.US', 'UVXY.US', 'ZM.US']",['ZOOM'],"{'polarity': 0.82, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.077}"

Global Credit Research - 07 Dec 2020

New York, December 07, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") assigned first time ratings to Planview Parent, Inc. (""Planview""), including a B3 Corporate Family Rating (CFR) and a B3-PD Probability of Default Rating (PDR). Concurrently, Moody's assigned a B2 rating to Planview's proposed senior secured first lien term loan (""First Lien Term Loan""), a B2 rating to the $65 million senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (""Revolver""), and a Caa2 rating to the proposed senior secured second lien term loan (""Second Lien Term Loan""). The outlook is stable. The ratings are subject to the transaction closing as proposed and review of the final documentation.

TPG Capital L.P. (""TPG"") and TA Associates Management L.P. (""TA"") will use cash supplemented by the debt proceeds of approximately $765 million to fund the purchase of a majority interest in Planview from Thoma Bravo, who will retain a minority share of the equity in Planview. Pro forma for the transaction, debt to EBITDA is 7.9x (latest twelve months September 30, 2020 and including adjustments to exclude purchase accounting effects, add back certain non-recurring costs, and incorporate run-rate cost synergies, Moody's adjusted).

Assignments:

..Issuer: Planview Parent, Inc.

.... Corporate Family Rating, Assigned B3

.... Probability of Default Rating, Assigned B3-PD

....Senior Secured First Lien Bank Credit Facilities, Assigned B2 (LGD3)

....Senior Secured Second Lien Bank Credit Facility, Assigned Caa2 (LGD5)

Outlook Actions:

..Issuer: Planview Parent, Inc.

....Outlook, Assigned Stable

RATINGS RATIONALE

The B3 CFR reflects financial leverage, which Moody's expects will remain over 7.5x debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) over the near term, that is very high given Planview's small scale, with annual revenues of less than $300 million, and the relatively discretionary nature of Planview's products compared to other enterprise software, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Although the project and portfolio management (PPM) industry is fragmented, with many niche competitors, the industry also includes large, diversified competitors, including Broadcom, Micro Focus, Atlassian, and Microsoft, which have greater financial resources and more diverse product lines than Planview. Product concentration results from the small revenue base, with project and portfolio management (PPM) products accounting for over three quarters of revenues, exposing Planview to revenue volatility should customer product preferences shift. Given the private equity ownership, Moody's anticipates that debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) will remain high, varying between 6x and 8x over the intermediate term, due to debt funded acquisitions or equity distributions following periods of deleveraging. The company's financial policies will be a key corporate governance consideration under Moody's ESG framework.

Story continues

Still, Planview benefits from a large base of recurring revenues, accounting for about 85% of revenues, and low capital intensity, which results in consistent free cash flow (FCF) generation. Further contributing to stability, revenues are diversified by industry and customer, with the top 10 customers accounting for less than 9% of revenues. Moody's believes that Planview holds a strong niche market position in the PPM market, which indicates market acceptance of Planview's product line and supports solid EBITDA margins. Moreover, increasingly complex workflows at large, diversified companies should provide an ongoing secular driver to Planview's Portfolio Management and Work Management products, supporting revenue growth over the intermediate to long term.

Planview's liquidity is good. Moody's expects Planview to generate annualized FCF of approximately $40 million over the next 12-18 months, to maintain at least $25 million of balance sheet cash, and for the proposed $65 million Revolver to remain undrawn. Although there are no financial covenants governing the First Lien Term Loan and Second Lien Term Loan, the Revolver is subject to a usage based financial covenant, a first lien net leverage ratio (as defined), when utilization of the Revolver exceeds 35%. Moody's expects that Planview will have a substantial cushion on the first lien net leverage covenant at the close of the transaction and will maintain this cushion at least over the near term.

The stable rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Planview's revenues will grow organically in the low to mid-single digit range over the near term driven by end market demand across its portfolio of Portfolio Management and Work Management software. Moody's expects some near term margin pressure with reduced spending in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. Moody's expects margins to gradually improve over the next 12 to 18 months with the gradual reopening of economies, such that the EBITDA margin will exceed 37% (Moody's adjusted) and debt to EBITDA will decline toward the mid 7x range (Moody's adjusted). Given the strong translation of EBITDA into FCF, Moody's anticipates that FCF to debt will approach the mid 6 percent level (Moody's adjusted).

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

Given the small revenue base and high financial leverage, an upgrade is unlikely in the near term. Over the intermediate term, Moody's could upgrade Planview's ratings if the company profitably grows, with revenue growth sustained at least in the upper single digits percent level, annual revenues of at least $300 million, and EBITDA margins increasing toward 40% (Moody's adjusted). Moody's would expect that Planview would follow a financial policy balancing the interests of creditors and shareholders, maintaining leverage below 6.5x debt to EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) and FCF to debt (Moody's adjusted) above 5%.

Moody's could downgrade Planview's ratings if competitive or execution challenges result in revenue and EBITDA declining such that Moody's adjusted leverage is sustained above 8x debt to EBITDA and FCF to debt (Moody's adjusted) fails to achieve at least the low-single digits percent level.

The First Lien Term Loan and Revolver are rated B2, one notch above the CFR, given their senior position in the capital structure, with a first lien on all assets, and loss absorption provided by the Second Lien Term Loan. The Second Lien Term Loan is rated Caa2, reflecting its effective subordination to the first lien debt.

As proposed the First Lien Term Loan provides flexibility that if utilized could negatively impact creditors, including: (1) incremental pari passu term facilities of at least $102 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), plus additional amounts limited by maximum proforma First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined) of 5.25x and incremental junior secured debt limited by proforma Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined) of 7.5x; (2) the ability to transfer assets based on an investment basket but subject to a blocker provision limiting the transfer of material intellectual property to unrestricted subsidiaries; and (3) requirement that only wholly-owned subsidiaries act as subsidiary guarantors. The credit agreement requires 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales and insurance proceeds from casualty events, subject to step-downs based on the First Lien Leverage Ratio (50% repayment requirement at 4.75x First Lien Leverage and 0% at 4.25x), to be used to repay the First Lien Term Loan if not reinvested within 18 months.

Planview, headquartered in Austin, Texas is a provider of portfolio management and work management software across a broad set of enterprise customers. Planview will be owned by funds affiliated with private equity sponsors TPG, TA, and Thoma Bravo.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

DAN HOWLEY: Do you think that sets you up for a better future, knowing that, you know, you've already IPOed and now you don't have to do the whole scramble where investors look and, you know, they don't see the profitability yet, they don't see the profitability yet, you have to constantly say it's coming?

KELLY STECKELBERG: So from, I think, the day that Zoom was founded, we've taken a very frugal approach. And you know, we think about-- first of all, the capital that we have is not ours. It is our investors'. It belongs to our shareholders, and previously it belonged to the VCs and the early investors in Zoom. And so we always take a very thoughtful approach about how we invest.

And to that, part of our corporate culture and our onboarding is to think about this. So in our offices, for example, on all the screens always running as part of our kind of corporate culture slideshow, there's a slide that says, if you take one minute to think about spending $1 of your own money, take two minutes to think about spending $1 of Zoom's money. So we really want to encourage and empower everyone to be thoughtful about how we invest.

And then, of course, we have a whole process and planning cycle around how we prioritize investments. We really focus on initiatives that drive top line growth. So R&D and sales are always a priority. And then looking at opportunities where we can be really efficient in areas like G&A, where we invest in automation. And thinking about how we can avoid hiring, if possible, by doing things in a more efficient way.

And I can't take credit for that. Like, that is embedded in the company culture. Which is great, because there's no way that I could do that on my own. It's really an effort that's driven in the entire company.

DAN HOWLEY: So you guys just announced your Q3 quarter, the 2021 fiscal year, and you saw $770.2 million in revenue. That was an increase of 367% year over year, and earnings per share were $0.99. That was also a massive increase. I guess, when you look at that, and you think long term, the comparables are going to get tough. Naturally, right? You-- you know, that kind of growth is--

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yep, for sure.

DAN HOWLEY: --huge. So how do you then, I guess, temper expectations? Right? Because we saw after the earnings report, people weren't satisfied with the 367% revenue increase, which-- you know, whatever that says. I guess, where do you-- where do you see the ability to temper that kind of expectation going forward, when you've already seen this massive growth throughout the year?

KELLY STECKELBERG: So what we always say internally, first of all, is we can't control the stock price. What we can control is our own execution. So that's what we are really focused on. And thinking about, what does the future look like? And part of that is around, what does the future of work look like? We're spending a lot of time thinking about, you know, remote work trends, this vision and strategy of work anywhere that I believe is really coming, even in a post-pandemic era.

And we innovate. We announced some great innovations in October at Zoomtopia around things like Smart Gallery, which really enhances the face to face communication experience when you have some employees in the office and you have some that are working from different locations. Things like voice commands and remote reception to help keep people safe as we start to move around the world again.

We also have tremendous growth opportunity in Zoom Phone, which is our cloud PBX product that's about a year and a half old now. So very early stages still with that. We see tremendous opportunity with international. International grew over 600% year over year in Q3. So it's growing faster than the US. And with the increased brand awareness that we've seen during this pandemic, it's really opened up markets that would have taken us years and probably millions of marketing dollars to get to. But we're able to go in and hire talent there directly now, which is really exciting.

And then we have other brand new platforms and products that we announced, again, in October, including OnZoom, which is our event hosting platform. And this is creating an opportunity for really the-- the probably million staff-- millions of hosts that are on our platform every day that are running small businesses or doing things like fitness classes, and bringing them together with their attendees on a platform that provides a seamless experience for them.

And it will also serve as a directory of events and a discovery mechanism, so that if you wake up in the morning like, hey, I want to take a fitness class, but here I am in Queens and I can't go outside-- how am I going to do that? You can look at OnZoom and you can find what's available in a time zone that works for you, and very quickly sign up and be in a class.

And so all of those are creating tremendous opportunities for the way that Zoom's going to be integrated in our lives, even when it's safe for us to move around in the world again. And all of those have different aspects of growth opportunities ahead. So we're really excited about the future and what it holds.

DAN HOWLEY: I guess, when you look at-- you know, you talk about how the brand awareness exploded, right? You know, it was a big IPO. A lot of people were looking forward to it. But the average consumer might not have known, right, if they weren't working in an office at that point.

And now, you know, you-- I was talking to my editor about this and, you know, she's-- she mentioned that people don't ask, do you want to get a drink? They go, do you want to-- do you want to Zoom? Yeah, we do that. My wife and I do that with our friends. Do you want to hop on a Zoom? And you know. So, you know, Skype existed. Microsoft Teams was in existence. Google Meet was in existence. So it was hangouts, it was whatever they were calling it at that point. But there were big name competitors.

So how do you kind of explain the way that Zoom went from, you know, known in the enterprise space to this consumer service now, where originally it wasn't necessarily there, and-- and how do you continue to go along with that?

KELLY STECKELBERG: So everything that we do at Zoom is focused on delivering happiness to our customers and our employees. And-- and the way we do that from the customer perspective has really been focusing on ease of use, as well as reliability of the platform. And so you're absolutely right. Before this pandemic, we were really known in the enterprise space and the-- you know, the B2B space, but not nearly as well in the individual or consumer space.

And I think because it's so easy to use, as we saw schools start to adopt it. It's easy enough for a kindergartener to get on and know how to navigate around. It's also simple enough for, you know, grandparents to feel comfortable getting on and reading stories with their grandchildren.

And so I think it was that, combined with the scalability of the platform, that-- that held up and was there and able to serve, you know, really, the millions of new consumers and users that came to our platform in a very quick period of time, is what led to that extreme growth and increase in brand awareness.

Just to give you some perspective on growth, if you look at last December, we were averaging 10 million daily participants. And in the spring, we announced that that had grown to over 300 million daily participants. And so in a very short period of time, we saw a dramatic increase in usage. And I think it's the scalability of the platform that allowed us to do that.

DAN HOWLEY: When-- when you look, you know, at the different types of usage, I mentioned-- mentioned school. We were doing a separate breakout piece on Zoom in education, how, you know, universities had worked with Zoom, and then, you know, now it's K through 12. I think my nephew might use Zoom schools, and he's like three years old. So as you said, it is easy enough for kids to get on there and-- and communicate through it.

My poor parents have to do construction paper turkey hats for Thanksgiving for them, but still, you know, it works. I guess--

KELLY STECKELBERG: How sweet!

DAN HOWLEY: With-- it's-- it's amazing. When you look at the telemedicine industry, that was something, I think, that felt very much still in its infancy until it was forced to grow up real quick, where people were nervous about going to hospitals because they thought they would get sick. And Zoom became something that a lot of people relied on to-- to talk to their doctors. I mean, I use Zoom calls. My-- my parents use Zoom calls for their own checkups.

So I guess how did you see that developing throughout the pandemic? Because that was something that existed beforehand, right?

KELLY STECKELBERG: It did. So we absolutely-- health care has been one of the key verticals that we have focused on for a long time. We support HIPAA compliance in both Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone and of course, that's what's really important to give confidence to health care providers to be able to talk to their clients and their patients and ensure that they're doing it in a very safe, secure, and private way.

And that's what we all want to know, right? That we don't want to ever have to worry about the security of the platform when we're having these really sensitive, important discussions with our health care providers. And that's exactly what Zoom provides. Combined with the ease of use that all, you know, again, all ranges and ages of patients and clients can easily join a meeting.

DAN HOWLEY: Is-- is there anything where you have to talk to insurers, or have you talked to insurers? Is that something that you guys work with? And I guess, are-- are competitors something like Teladoc or Amwell, or do you work with them? How does that work?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah, so our strategy is we're really more of a horizontal platform that supports the need of then the other app developers that want to build on top of it. So for example, we wouldn't talk to the insurers because we're not the one providing the service itself. We're just there to facilitate it so that we make it really easy for a doctor and a patient to come together.

And then, of course, we have our App Marketplace that allows developers then to build specific verticalized apps on top of our horizontal platform.

DAN HOWLEY: So if there's something like a, say, regular generic doctor's appointment, your primary care physician, there may be an app available that would plug into Zoom that they would then use? And then Zoom would be the video platform that they work through.

KELLY STECKELBERG: Exactly right. So maybe they're using one of the apps in the App Marketplace to do things like scheduling. And then that facilitates, you know, everything leading up to the meeting, and then you join the meeting with your health care provider. And then maybe afterwards, there's a follow up for your next appointment or something. But we're really at the core of bringing people together for the meeting itself.

DAN HOWLEY: OK. And I guess, as far as, you know, working at Zoom and what it's been like, I know that you guys obviously had to go on a hiring spree, I'm sure, because the kind of growth kind of necessitates that. But what have you seen, I guess, as far as going from a company that was known in the IT space to a company that's now, you know, a lifeline to a lot of people as far as connecting and staying connected? And how has that impacted employees? Is there, you know, a greater sense of-- of importance put on their own work? And how are they working from home in the same kind of conditions?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah, so we sent our employees home in early March, and the advantage, of course, that we had is that we all live on this technology every day. So we didn't have to adopt to that. You know, March 15, the world changed for us when there started to be this dramatic increase in demand and need for the product.

And first of all, a huge testament to the commitment and sheer will of our Zoom employees, who worked tirelessly for our first couple of months to do everything we could to make sure that every customer and every prospect that wanted Zoom or needed Zoom had access to it.

And as you said, we've hired a lot. We have about a third of our workforce today has been hired during the last nine months, which means they've never stepped foot in an office. They've never met their manager or their teammates in person. And so to ensure that we are able-- you know, our culture is a very important part of Zoom.

And so, to ensure that we've been able to continue that during this time, our People Experience team has come up with a complete virtual onboarding experience, and the leadership team, we've all become more thoughtful and deliberate about connecting with our teams. We're being very thoughtful about boundaries to ensure that we give people, you know, some-- some space. It's really easy, in this work from environment, to have your days extend. So being very thoughtful about that.

One of my favorite-- I always use this example. One of my favorite examples of that is one of our employees taking a Friday off and putting on her Out of Office that she was in a backyard campout with her kids. And I love that. Even though we're not traveling, we all need to make time to spend-- for those experiences. And the leadership team, trying to really lead by example around that.

And you know, we at Zoom-- I think I speak for the entire company-- we are very humbled and proud of the opportunity that we've been given during this time to support connection in the community and try to minimize disruption as much as we can in-- in learning and connected. I love hearing about you and your wife, you know, meeting with your friends, families coming together.

We have heard countless stories of, you know, adoptions and weddings and engagements, bar mitzvahs. And then even end of life ceremonies. And all of those are beautiful experiences that we feel so amazingly proud to be the platform that people have let into their lives to bring them together.

DAN HOWLEY: I guess, you know, when-- when it comes to using Zoom and-- at a certain point, do you-- do you have to tell people how to-- you know, employees how to help with the fatigue of always being on screen or talking to people on screen? How-- how does that kind of balance out?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Well, I think, like all employers around the globe right now, we're all searching for ways to make sure that we are supporting our employees in the best way possible. So a couple of things we've done-- I talked about earlier being very thoughtful about, first, workload. We are hiring as quickly as we can. Again, our employees have done everything they can to support our customers during this time, and we're adding resources where we need as quickly as possible. Really being thoughtful about boundaries.

We're also doing fun things, like we have a-- we have a team at Zoom called the Happy Crew, and the Happy Crew is exactly what it sounds like. They're there to help support in delivering happiness to our employees every day. They've sent out some really cute surprises every month. We had one that was all about setting up your work from home environment with a mug and some exercise bands, things like that, just to make us all more productive and healthy during this time. They sent out one for Diwali and we had an online Diwali celebration, which was amazing. I loved it. It was so beautiful.

So things like that, as well as we did-- we used to have a monthly gym membership allowance that everybody could have. As most gyms are not accessible to people during that time, we've now converted that over to a more broad-based sti-- monthly stipend that people can use for things like food delivery, grocery delivery.

And we've heard from our employees, even that helps. You know, not having to make dinner a couple of times a month is-- really helps relieve the stress, because they're all trying to deal with, you know, teaching their-- their children at the same time they're working full time, at the same time trying to maintain a household. So we're always looking for ways that we can continue to support employees like that.

DAN HOWLEY: And then just finally, I know we had-- we won't be able to speak with Eric, but I just want to, you know, kind of get a sense of him and how he's working. You know, I know he's kind of been focused on the business for day one, probably, obviously. But since it's kind of taken off, that's got to be what you all are doing.

So I guess when you, you know, look at something like that, is it that he is very focused all the time on the business, and how does that kind of communication work? Do you guys work hand in hand as an executive team? What is that kind of relationship like?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah. So we have a couple of modes of communication within the organization. We do-- Eric has a weekly staff meeting where his-- instead of his direct reports, we all come together, and that's where we talk about initiatives, certainly review, like, the forecast every week, things like that, as well as hiring and how that's all going.

And we have-- we leverage our own internal chat product extensively and stay in touch very-- on a day to-- you know, key day to day items on an ongoing basis. I think in general, Eric's passion is certainly around our product, and he is a true visionary who is always thinking about how do we drive the product forward.

And he is also super passionate about our customers as well, and spends a lot of time with customers, listening to them, helping, of course, sell to new prospects. But also just thinking about what is it that we can do to continue delivering happiness to our customers?

And, you know, he really challenged all of us every day to think about every decision that we make at Zoom from the customer or the employee's perspective. And if you keep that in mind, you're going to come to the right decision. If you're doing the right thing for your customers and employees, you're generally doing the right thing for the business.

DAN HOWLEY: How is it, just-- you know, at this-- promise, last one-- when you reach out to customers, you guys have to talk to customers, is it something that's changed since you've gotten so much larger? Is it more difficult to stay in touch, or is it still the same, perhaps, intimate relationship that existed prior?

KELLY STECKELBERG: Yeah, I think what has grown commensurate-- or we're working on having it grow commensurate with the growth in our customer base-- is things like our sales organization, our customer success organization, our technical support team, our sales engineers to ensure that we have the teams that are there to continue to support our customers, ensure that their needs are being met, and also, as you say, stay connected to them.

You know, it-- we're-- we're playing catch-up for sure, as we saw such a dramatic increase in our customer base in Q1, Q2, and into Q3, but we are focused on that, and certainly hiring as quickly as possible.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/company-kelly-steckelberg-zoom-cfo-092500654.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'ASBAX.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'QQQ.US', 'TQQQ.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VZ.US', 'ZM.US']","['DAN HOWLEY', 'ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS']","{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.158}"
220,2020-12-06T22:00:13+00:00,These Two Words Will Strike Fear Into Gadget Makers This Christmas,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Global electronics companies hoping to enjoy a spike in sales during a pandemic-inflicted Christmas need to avoid the one thing that stands in the way of a bonanza: shortages.

The shuttering of factories, a reduction in flights, and rolling lockdowns mean that the robustness of a company’s supply chain will end up being of critical strategic advantage. The list of tech giants looking to mitigate, or leverage, challenges in procuring and delivering products during this shopping season reads like a Who’s Who of global brands.Sony Corp., Nintendo Co., Microsoft Corp., HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Xiaomi Corp. and Apple Inc. are among those facing possible lost sales simply because the companies that supply components, assemble devices, or transport their products across the globe are coping with unprecedented difficulties due to Covid-19.

Two words pinned to the product listing of Sony’s new PlayStation 5 on the Best Buy Co. website on an early December evening reveal the one thing executives must fear: “Sold Out.”

On Amazon.com Inc.’s U.S. site, it was “Currently Unavailable.” A similar story is playing out for Microsoft’s Xbox X/S consoles and Nintendo’s Switch.

Such shortages are particularly galling for Sony and Microsoft, because they come as both companies launch their newest games machines in four years, just in time for the seasonal rush.(1)

A big worry is that shoppers unable to purchase their preferred console may opt for an alternative, and the pain of that lost opportunity may be suffered for years to come through follow-on revenue from games and services. The impact is already being felt, according to research firm SuperData, with sales of digital titles over the Thanksgiving weekend dropping 10% from 2019, despite a captive market of consumers stuck indoors.

Apple isn’t immune, either. The iPhone experienced its latest annual launch in history because the pandemic hit both development and production. That had an immediate impact on the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 26, with no guarantee that consumers will end up buying the new model with so many competing toys now vying for their attention.

Story continues

Rather than merely favoring big suppliers who have more resources, production shortages are offering opportunities to smaller players. Nintendo awarded a coveted contract to Sharp Corp., traditionally a maker of screens, to assemble Switch consoles at a factory in Malaysia, Bloomberg News reported, after months of struggling to make enough units at facilities in China and Vietnam. Sony committed to providing more inventory to retailers ahead of the Christmas rush, without saying where it would get the new machines. It’s likely considering adding another assembler or two to shore up supply amid ongoing shortages that have seen after-market prices climb to almost double the retail value.

As the pandemic drags on, even with vaccines set to roll out in coming months, the costs from this global bottleneck could climb into the billions of dollars. Throughout the most recent earnings season, executives outlined the lost revenue and higher expenses from continued supply congestion. The increased outlays include the need to ship by more expensive air routes instead of by sea to make up lost time, a problem exacerbated by a reduced aviation fleet as passenger flights slow to a trickle. Read About: IPhone Delay Interrupts That Supply Chain RhythmHP, which gets two-thirds of its revenue from personal computers and the rest from printers, just closed out its fiscal 2020 with a 3.6% drop in revenue, the worst in four years. President Enrique Lores told investors that “performance this quarter was more driven by supply chain than by demand.” British chip designer Dialog Semiconductor Plc is expected to post a 15% decline in sales this year, saying last month that it could have shipped 5% to 10% more if not for shortages of chip supplies and testing services.

Dell has also been hit, with a lack of components including chips and displays causing congestion and driving up expenses. But the Round Rock, Texas-based company is hoping to spin that into a win, with Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke telling investors that its “industry-leading global supply chain” gives it a “significant competitive advantages to be the partner of choice.”

The notion that their supply chains provide an edge over rivals has been a common boast in recent months for other companies, including chipmaker STMicroelectronics NV, electronics assembler Flex Ltd., and even Best Buy.

If they’re right, they’ll get through Christmas fine. If not, it’ll be a bleak new year.

222,2020-11-30T10:30:00+00:00,"CNH Industrial, Accenture and Microsoft collaborate to develop connected industrial vehicles","Five-year agreement involves the creation of global network of digital hubs to help CNH Industrial enhance its digital capabilities

London, Milan, New York, November 30, 2020

Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are collaborating with CNH Industrial (NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI) to help the capital goods company enhance its digital capabilities and develop “smart” connected products and services.

The program is an integral part of CNH Industrial’s digital transformation initiative, which is designed to help the company grow topline revenue, build a digitally enabled workforce, and enhance sustainability.

The key element of the five-year collaboration is the creation of a global network of digital hubs — in Brazil, Europe, India and the U.S. — where the three companies will work together to design, launch and manage digital services that will make the products of CNH Industrial’s brands even smarter, more functional, secure and sustainable.

The connected vehicles will provide customers with new services and functionalities in a variety of areas, including computer-aided farming, predictive maintenance, enhanced fleet management and green transportation. CNH Industrial also plans to develop a broad set of data-driven digital services to help clients drive sustainability, such as yield improvement in agriculture and more-efficient vehicles and improved fleet management in the transportation industry. By complementing its historical product-sales-based business model with new digital-driven services, CNH Industrial intends to achieve significant revenue growth.

223,2020-11-26T03:19:54+00:00,Nintendo Adds Sharp as Assembler of Popular Switch Console,"(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. has added Sharp Corp. as an assembler of its Switch console, according to people directly involved in the matter, as it works to stabilize production and hedge against U.S.-China trade tensions.

The video game giant has struggled to produce enough units for most of this year as the hit game Animal Crossing: New Horizons and stuck-at-home consumers fueled demand. While the coronavirus outbreak hurt production early on, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said this month that output has returned to normal and the Switch is now made in Malaysia, in addition to existing China and Vietnam locations.

That Malaysia factory is owned by Sharp, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Nintendo’s main assembly partner Foxconn Technology Co., a key unit of Foxconn Technology Group, owns a Sharp stake and helped connect the two Japanese companies, they added. Sharp continues to operate separately from its Taiwanese owner and its stock will be added to the Nikkei 225 Stock Average next week after a four-year absence.

Sharp shares were up as much as 2.8% Thursday, outperforming the benchmark TOPIX and reaching their highest point since February, while Nintendo rose as much as 3.5%.

Nintendo asked Foxconn Tech during the Trump era to provide alternative manufacturing sites outside of China to hedge against the trade war, according to one of the people, and the company ended up directing some Switch orders to Sharp as the Japanese company had extra capacity in Malaysia. The production volume in the Southeast Asia site is limited, the person said.

Nintendo’s Furukawa has said those assembly lines aren’t yet running at full capacity and the first batch from them is about to hit store shelves soon.

A Sharp representative declined to comment, while a Nintendo spokesman declined to confirm any details beyond the president’s earlier public comments.

Story continues

Switch assemblers plan to operate at maximum capacity through the end of this year, eschewing the typical December lull that follows the fulfillment of holiday demand. That suggests Nintendo, in the current quarter, may end up shipping more than the 10.8 million Switch units it managed in the October-December period last year.

Nintendo has been diversifying its supply chain since before the Covid-19 era and its chief said at this month’s press conference that the Malaysia addition is part of the effort. Osaka-based Sharp has a history of working with Nintendo, having once assembled the Famicom console and later provided key components for the 3DS handheld device. The bulk of Switch production continues to be handled by Foxconn Tech in China.

Switch sales momentum kept up in October, according to the Nintendo president, and the hotly anticipated debuts of new consoles from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in November were marred by severely limited launch-day supplies. Nintendo is expected to raise its fiscal-year sales target from the current 24 million when it next reports quarterly results, with David Gibson, chief investment adviser at Astris Advisory Japan, forecasting 26.4 million total sales for the period ending March 31.

Released in 2017, the Switch has sold 68.3 million units as of Sept. 30 and its lifetime sales are on track to exceed 100 million units. The company has expressed confidence in the beefed-up games lineup it has in store for 2021. Bloomberg News has also reported Nintendo plans an upgraded hardware revision, likely with 4K graphics support, to help extend the Switch’s life cycle.

225,2020-11-24T21:27:09+00:00,Dell Reports Revenue That Tops Estimates on Robust PC Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts’ estimates, in a sign of robust demand for the company’s personal computers during the pandemic-fueled work-from-home period.

Sales climbed 2.8% to $23.5 billion in the period that ended Oct. 30, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $21.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $2.03 a share compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.42.

Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell has sought to modernize his namesake company by moving to a subscription-based business model. Dell Technologies is letting clients pay for software and hardware as they go rather than upfront, which will generate more predictable, recurring revenue. The company formed a pact with FedEx Corp. and Switch Inc. earlier this month to develop a U.S.-based private cloud network hosted in FexEx facilities, giving customers an alternative to corporate server farms and public cloud services from Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp.

“We met unprecedented demand for remote work and learn solutions,” Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement.

Dell shares gained 3% in extended trading after closing at $70.33 in New York. The stock has increased 37% this year.

Revenue from consumer PCs jumped 14% to $3.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter, the company said. PC sales to business and government clients increased 5.4% to $8.78 billion.

Server and networking sales fell 1.8% to $4.16 billion, while storage hardware revenue declined 7% to $3.86 billion.

Sales from VMware Inc., a software maker majority-owned by Dell, rose 8% to $2.89 billion. The publicly traded company offers software for data centers as well as programs that let employees access their corporate systems to work remotely. Dell is considering plans to spin off VMware, but won’t make a decision until after September 2021.

229,2020-11-23T12:00:00+00:00,Foxconn Plant Championed by Trump Lands Google Server Contract,"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group plans to assemble key components for Google servers from its plant in Wisconsin, people familiar with the matter said, finally breathing life into a factory Donald Trump hailed as crucial to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

The Taiwanese company has decided to locate production for this new contract at the existing complex rather than make the components at home or in China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive move. The under-utilized factory should start mass production in the first quarter, timed with the release of Intel Corp.’s Ice Lake server chips, they said. Foxconn is setting up surface-mount technology assembly lines that it will use to place semiconductors onto circuit boards, they added.

Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is one of several Taiwanese firms exploring ways to expand in America and lessen a reliance on Chinese production bases. The company has also sought to diversify a business that counts on Apple Inc. for half its revenue, including by courting more American clients. On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. won city-level incentives for a $12 billion chip plant in Phoenix, another step toward bringing high-tech manufacture back to the U.S. and addressing security concerns over the industry’s supply chain.

A Foxconn representative confirmed it’s developing data center infrastructure and high-performance computing “capabilities” in Wisconsin, but declined to name any customers.

Taiwan counts Washington as an essential diplomatic, economic and military ally amid rising tensions with Beijing. Foxconn, which operates most of its factories in central and southern China, won Google’s business because it was the only contract manufacturer capable of establishing a surface-mount technology line on American soil, one of the people said. Shanghai-listed Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., its cloud business unit, will oversee the server business in Wisconsin, another person familiar with Foxconn’s operations said.

Story continues

The plant in Wisconsin was unveiled to much fanfare in 2018 by Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou and Trump, who called it “the Eighth Wonder of the World.” Once envisioned as the centerpiece of a Made in America effort that would create 13,000 jobs for the Badger State, it instead succumbed to delays and switched directions several times after local officials slashed subsidies. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with just 178 full-time employees. And rather than the promised large-sized display panels, it began churning out face masks and ventilators this year.

Yet its location in the heart of America is now a boon to Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is trying to win lucrative contracts for its server-dependent cloud business. The U.S. company considers it an important area for the company’s growth, but one in which Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. dominate. An American base could help Foxconn court U.S. government contracts, particularly as Washington ramps up scrutiny over a largely Chinese-focused global electronics supply chain.

Brandes Investment Partners disclosed its third-quarter portfolio last week.

Following Benjamin Graham's value investing style, the San Diego-based investment firm, which was founded by the now-retired guru Charles Brandes (Trades, Portfolio), takes positions in out-of-favor securities that have attractive total return potential and holds them until the market recognizes their true worth.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with FMX. Click here to check it out.  FMX 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of FMX Peter Lynch Chart of FMX

Keeping these criteria in mind, the firm entered eight new positions during the quarter, sold out of 25 investments and added to or trimmed a slew of other existing holdings. Among the most notable trades was a new stake in Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB de CV (NYSE:FMX) as well as reductions in the NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Cemex SAB de CV (NYSE:CX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) positions.

Fomento Economico Mexicano

The firm invested in 1.08 million shares of Fomento Economico Mexicano, allocating 2.12% of the equity portfolio to the stake. The stock traded for an average price of $58.41 per share during the quarter.

Also known as FEMSA, the Mexican company, which bottles Coca-Cola products and operates a chain of convenience stores, has a $26.9 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $75.25 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 130.24, a price-book ratio of 2.17 and a price-sales ratio of 1.08.

The Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overpriced. Charles Brandes' Firm Buys FEMSA, Trims Largest Holding Cemex

Weighed down by poor interest coverage and a low cash-to-debt ratio, GuruFocus rated FEMSA's financial strength 5 out of 10. The Altman Z-Score of 1.78 also warns the company could be in danger of going bankrupt unless it improves its liquidity. The company is also destroying value for shareholders as the weighted average cost of capital exceeds the return on invested capital.

Story continues

The company's profitability fared a bit better, scoring an 8 out of 10 rating despite having declining margins. In addition, FEMSA's returns underperform over half of its competitors, but it has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 4 that indicates operations are stable. As a result of recording a slowdown in revenue per share growth over the past 12 months, the predictability rank of five out of five stars is on watch. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return an average of 12.1% annually over a 10-year period.

Of the gurus invested in FEMSA, First Eagle Investment (Trades, Portfolio) has the largest stake with 1.57% of outstanding shares. Other top guru shareholders are Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio), Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) and Tom Russo (Trades, Portfolio).

NXP's financial strength was rated 4 out of 10 by GuruFocus.

The company's profitability scored a 7 out of 10 rating despite having margins and returns that underperform over half of its industry peers. NXP also has a low Piotroski F-Score of 3, which indicates operating conditions are in poor shape, while the 3.5-star predictability rank is on watch as a result of declining revenue per share over the past year.

Microsoft's financial strength was rated 7 out of 10 by GuruFocus, driven by a comfortable level of interest coverage as well as a robust Altman Z-Score of 7.14. Its assets, however, are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing, which indicates the company may be becoming less efficient. Regardless, it has good value creation since the ROIC surpasses the WACC.

The company's profitability fared even better, scoring a 9 out of 10 rating on the back of an expanding operating margin, strong returns that outperform a majority of competitors and a high Piotroski F-Score of 8.

Based in Cambridge, England, Bango is a mobile commerce platform that assists in expanding consumer reach of online enterprises by connecting them with several payment partners. Bango will enable telecommunications operators to club Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and Xbox All Access service with their own subscriptions.

By enhancing the visibility of its subscription service, Microsoft is trying to boost the number of takers for its next-generation consoles and consolidate its competitive positioning against Sony Corporation SNE and Nintendo NTDOY in the lucrative video games’ market.

Microsoft launched its highly-awaited consoles — Xbox Series X and Xbox series S — on Nov 10, globally. Meanwhile, Sony’s PlayStation 5 hit retail shelves in North America and Mexico on Nov 12. PlayStation 5 will become available in Europe and United Kingdom from Nov 19.

Both the consoles are competitively priced. Sony’s PlayStation 5 carries a price tag of $499.99 in the United States, while Xbox Series X is priced at $499. Xbox Series S retails for $299.

Microsoft Working on Subscriptions to Boost Console Sales

If we take into consideration the sales of last-generation consoles, Sony’s PlayStation has an edge over Xbox consoles. Per VGChartz data, total lifetime sales Xbox One through October 2020 were 48.5 million units compared with PlayStation 4’s sales of 113.8 million units.

With the launch of next generation Xbox and PlayStation hardware, the competition has heated up in the video game console space.

Apart from a worldwide launch, Microsoft is enhancing its Game Pass subscription service to boost sales of its consoles.

Story continues

Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription service offers gamers access to more than 100 game titles (including Minecraft Dungeons and Destiny 2) for a lowly $14.99 fee per month. The subscription service has found success and boasts more than 15 million users.

Further, the company integrated its xCloud gaming service with Game Pass subscription. The xCloud integration allows Ultimate Pass subscribers to access more than 100 game titles anywhere at any time on any devices (PC, mobile or console).

Microsoft also teamed up with Electronic Arts EA to club the latter’s EA Play service with its Xbox Game Pass subscription at no extra cost to the subscribers. With EA Play, Ultimate Pass subscribers can access more than 60 popular EA titles (FIFA 20, Battlefield, and Need For Speed) on Xbox consoles including Xbox One, Series X and Series S.

With the Bethesda buyout, Microsoft will be combining Bethesda’s popular AAA titles to the Game Pass library.

These endeavours are expected to boost subscriber base for Game Pass Ultimate and eventually benefit the sales of Xbox consoles.

Meanwhile, with Xbox All Access, gamers need to shell out $34.99 per month for 24 months to get access to latest Xbox Series X video game console along with a 24-month subscription of Game Pass Ultimate. For Xbox Series S, All Access Plan is priced at $24.99 per month for two years. Gamers do not need to pay any upfront amount under the All Access Plans.

Traction in Global Gaming Activity Augurs Well

The increases in video gaming activity across the globe triggered by coronavirus crisis and ensuing shelter-in-place guidelines are expected to drive sales of newly released consoles.

Per data from The NPD Group, industry consumer spending on video gaming was $11.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 in the United States alone, representing improvement of 24% on a year over year basis. The fourth quarter of 2020 is also expected to witness robust momentum in consumer spending owing to the launch of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles, added the research firm.

The connected gaming console market is envisioned to hit $32.99 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 11.5% between 2020 and 2027, per Fior Markets Data.

Microsoft’s efforts to boost its market share in the console space are seemingly headed in the right direction. However, it remains to be seen if the company’s efforts yield the desired results.

At present, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.

238,2020-11-13T14:00:00+00:00,LinkedIn Co-founder: the number of ‘tech giants’ will double in 5 years,"LinkedIn Co-founder Reid Hoffman joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the future of big tech and the United States' relationship with China under a Biden administration.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: So as we go in to the Biden era, I'm curious as to what you think the direction and tenor of Washington, DC's desire to, perhaps, rein in or regulate the big-tech platforms, what path that's going to take. Because it's-- it's not at all clear cut. You've got Ted Cruz, David Cicilline, now Joe Biden, Sen. Warner, people with very different political perspectives, who seem to share distrust and anxiety about the platforms. But that's where the common ground ends, right?

REID HOFFMAN: Yeah. So look, roughly speaking, I'm-- this is not a no-regulation point of view. But I am a very strong believer that we've now moved to a multi-polar world. China will be building more and more of the technology platforms that matter in the coming years. And actually, to some degree, I hope that there's other places. Like I-- you know, one of the Greylock investments we have is this incubator called Entrepreneur First, which is building tech communities in Europe and in Singapore.

So you know, I hope for-- for more of this. But what that means is you don't disable your own player, right? You don't go hey, let's try to do that. What you want to do is you want to shape them.

You want to say, look, these outcomes, misinformation. Here is our social mandate for how we change that. So we have more truth in the media ecosystem. You know, those kinds of things are important.

But, like, the classic notion of an antitrust or breakup, I think those are, generally speaking, going to be actually, in fact, a counter American health and prosperity. And by the way, I say that as my primary thing as an investor, as new startups, as competing with these large tech companies. So this not like an embodied interest.

But actually, in fact, I think we're-- we have maybe five tech giants today. I think, you know, five years from now, we're going to have 10 tech giants. And those competition between those tech giants is what create lots of space for startups to either, you know, get their initial base, or to grow into being the 11th, or to be bought by one of them. And so that's part of the reason why I think actually, in fact, the-- the antitrust isn't the right thing. But figuring out how to contribute the right way to the health of-- of our society, and global society, is the right thing.

Story continues

ANDY SERWER: Two questions here. So first of all, when you're talking about going from five to 10, are you talking about the other five being in China? And then, also, what specifically, though, short of anti-trust and breaking things up, would be your remedies?

REID HOFFMAN: So-- so, on the first, actually, in fact, if you're including China, you're like five going to 25. Right? So, it is much larger.

I was actually just talking about, you know, the-- the kind of the growth of companies like, you know, Airbnb and others as they-- as they establish, you know, on the stage. And obviously, you know, there's a bunch right now around, like, Netflix and Salesforce and other kinds of things. So I think there's a range of these-- these companies have become multipart technology platforms. And with China, you're going to see a ton more.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/linkedin-co-founder-number-tech-140000446.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'EBAY.US', 'FB.US', 'FDX.US', 'FTEC.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'ORCL.US', 'PPL.US', 'QCLN.US', 'RYT.US', 'SNAP.US', 'TWTR.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VGT.US', 'VITAX.US', 'XLK.US', 'XSD.US']","['ANDY SERWER', 'BIDEN', 'TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS']","{'polarity': 0.987, 'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.083}"

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: President Trump has said, I didn't lose the election, and is challenging and contesting the results in specific states that he's lost by even an excess of 100,000 votes. He's lost the popular vote by close to five million. How do you think this is going to play out?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think ultimately, we will see a transition of power. I think we will see sabotage from Trump and his administration on that transition. I think that sabotage is essentially anti-American, it's anti, not just rule of law and process, but in good governance for all of us as American citizens who live here. And that's I think because, you know, President Trump has fundamentally more approached governance as a reality television show, you know, including the COVID stuff. Like I have a good feeling it's going to go away, you know, hey, maybe you can inject bleach, right? Because of course you're not talking to actually medical experts and doctors on this.

And I think that's going to be a real problem, and I think it's going to have lasting impacts on the divisions in the country, because we're, actually in fact, we should be saying, hey, we should be coming together. We should be building our way out of the pandemic. Like that should be, like you could just imagine, you know, like the superstars from the Republican side, you know, George W Bush and other folks kind of going, OK, like this is actually in fact, we should be coming together as a country. This is essentially what we should be doing, and I think this refusal to admit it, the treating it like it's a reality television star of like, you know, Donald Trump is on ""The Apprentice"" and refuses to be fired, you know, is simply a one more dismissive of the health of American society.

ANDY SERWER: Does this hurt the economy, Reid, and maybe in particular, Silicon Valley, and what's the conversation there like?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it definitely hurts the economy, because, you know, people frequently associate business only with like free flowing capital, lower taxes and lower regulation. And there's lots of things that help actually affect business. Like for example, a stable society that's predictable, an environment that you can invest in, an accessible use of talent, a healthy and thriving middle class that can buy goods and services. And so, actually in fact, there's a lot of different approaches that are being pro-business, and this kind of chaos is anti-business, because it-- now, relative to Silicon Valley, which obviously, you know, we're fortunate that technology is what's driving a lot of the changes in industry and the future.

So a lot of, you know, Silicon Valley investors and businesses are all benefiting from this. You know, even in COVID, where we see like, you know, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, said it very well in the first two months of the pandemic said, in two months, we've seen two years of digital transformation where people are using the technologies and adopting them more quickly and more thoroughly, because they need to in order to keep business running. So it's been, you know, good for all that, but instability is bad for all business, including technology.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/trump-refusal-concede-hurts-economy-154929978.html?.tsrc=rss,"['EBAY.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'PYPL.US', 'TSLA.US', 'TWTR.US', 'UVXY.US', 'ZNGA.US']",['PRESIDENT TRUMP'],"{'polarity': 0.994, 'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.143}"

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: Who better to weigh in on the challenges of a life at home than billionaire venture capitalist Reid Hoffman? An original member of the tech industry's PayPal Mafia, Hoffman was an early believer in social media, creating one of the internet's first social networks before launching the business-focused site LinkedIn.

Over the years, he's made big bets on companies like Facebook and Airbnb, and now sits on the board of some of the fastest growing startups in Silicon Valley. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I'm joined by Reid Hoffman as we discuss the future of the tech sector, the outcome of the 2020 election, and where he's putting his money to work as we look toward the near year.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest Reid Hoffman, entrepreneur, investor, venture capitalist, partner at VC firm Greylock, and Co-founder of LinkedIn. Reid, great to see you.

REID HOFFMAN: Great to see you as well, even in these modern pandemic times as we do this over Skype.

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, exactly. And so much to talk about, Pandemic and the election. Let's start with the election, Reid. And you have supported the Democrats and Joe Biden, invested resources into ousting President Trump. What's the most important reason why Joe Biden won?

REID HOFFMAN: I think the most important reason is actually, in fact, a need to return to stability, to unity rather than division, right? And then to apply expertise to questions like the pandemic. Because even though there might be some politicization about how bad is the pandemic and how much a shutdown is necessary, we should apply public health knowledge. We should apply scientific knowledge. We should apply economic knowledge in order to actually do good governance on it.

Story continues

And I think it's very much a referendum on, no, no, it's not a reality television show. Good governance matters. And I think that's one of the things where Biden, who's a lifelong centrist, who's part of the reason why his inaugural message was, I am here to govern for the entire country for everyone's well-being, not just the people who voted for me, in stark contrast, obviously, to President Trump.

ANDY SERWER: Reid, it's refreshing to hear you speaking out, whether or not I even happen to agree with you politically, because there are a lot of people who won't, business people who won't speak out. And again, either side of the aisle. How hard is it for you to do that? Because obviously, you're alienating some people.

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I definitely get grief. I get grief whether it's in a LinkedIn context or generally. And that's frustrating because most of the places where I try to speak out on this, I'm speaking out on a basis of rule of law, anti-corruption.

It's one of the reasons why I actually posted on LinkedIn recently, kind of like what is the-- and on Greylock, why CEOs should speak up in politics in some times. Because it isn't that speaking up on politics is necessarily being partisan.

If you're kind of like, look, what we want is we want stability, we want actionability to kind of work together, those kinds of things, that claim, if it is partisan, that it's partisan only on the side of goodness. Now, there are other times where I will also make some claims because there's a particular value that I like and many of those values are on the Democratic side.

But obviously, I'm very pro-business. And very pro-entrepreneurship. I'm very pro-technology. So there's a stack of things where I will articulate those. But as business people, if we want a centrist country, we want to not be run by the extremes of either the left or the right, you do need to speak up with the things that are the baseline centrism. Rule of law, count every vote, peaceful transition of power. These things matter for the health of our country and for the health of business.

ANDY SERWER: Well, let's talk about that a little bit more, then. I mean, President Trump has said, I didn't lose the election and is challenging and contesting the results in specific states that he's lost by even an excess of 100,000 votes. He's lost the popular vote by close to 5 million. How do you think this is going to play out?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think ultimately, we will see a transition of power. I think we will see sabotage from Trump and his administration on that transition. I think that sabotage is essentially anti-American. It's anti not just rule of law and process, but in good governance, for all of us as American citizens who live here.

And that's, I think, because President Trump has fundamentally more approached governance as a reality television show, including the COVID stuff. Like, I have a good feeling that it's going to go away. Hey, maybe you can inject bleach, right? Because, of course, you're not talking to actually medical experts and doctors on this.

And I think that's going to be a real problem and I think it's going to have a lasting impact on the divisions in the country. Because actually, in fact, we should be saying, hey, we should be coming together. We should be building our way out of the pandemic.

That should be-- you could just imagine the superstars on the Republican side, George W. Bush and other folks kind of going, OK, this is actually, in fact, we should be coming together as a country. This is essentially what we should be doing.

And I think this refusal to admit it, to treating it like it's a reality television star, of like, you know Donald Trump is on ""The Apprentice"" and refuses to be fired, is simply one more dismissive of the health of American society.

ANDY SERWER: Does this hurt the economy, Reid? And maybe in particular, Silicon Valley, and what's the conversation there like?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it definitely hurts the economy, because people frequently associate business only with free flowing capital, lower taxes, and lower regulation. And there's lots of things that help actually affect business.

Like, for example, a stable society that's predictable, an environment that you can invest in, and successful use of talent, a healthy and thriving middle class that can buy goods and services. And so actually, in fact, there's a lot of different approaches that are being pro-business, and this kind of chaos is anti-business, because it--

Now, relative to Silicon Valley, which, obviously, we're fortunate that technology is what's driving a lot of the changes in industry and in the future. So a lot of Silicon Valley investors and businesses are all benefiting from this.

Even in COVID, where we see Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, said it very well. In the first two months of the pandemic, he said, in two months, we've seen two years of digital transformation where people are using the technologies and adopting them more quickly and more thoroughly because they need to in order to keep business running. So it's been good for all that. But instability is bad for all business, including technology.

ANDY SERWER: You mentioned the social media platforms of which you are so familiar. How do you think they performed and what's your assessment of what happened during this election cycle?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think we're on a learning curve, and it kind of is unfortunate that we get to experience the learning curve versus get a complete plan and release it at scale. Because I think a lot of what has happened, which both Facebook and Twitter did in the last month, is stuff you wish they'd been doing for five plus years of, hey, this is actually counter to the experts, counter to facts.

This is dangerous. This is an incitement to violence. And saying, look, we're going to frame that and we're going to make sure that people are aware of that. And I think those are the beginnings of the steps in the right direction for what should actually, in fact, be persistent.

Like, for example, you've seen some of it even drop off now. Because they said, oh, the election is over. It's been called, so release that. And you're like, well, actually, in fact, people calling for election theft, which is, by the way, all the experts, including all the Republican experts, look at this and say, look, you can challenge on some narrow states and recount the ballot, but it's not going to make a difference.

Because at these numbers and at the safety of our voting systems, including the vote by mail, those have all called it. And actually, there's one particular piece I just-- I feel like I'm compelled to say, which is there was this kind of constant Republican line of, you're adding in points after the game is called.

And you're like, OK. If we want to use a metaphor, it's like you scored a leading touchdown in the third quarter, the third quarter of the game, and you want to call the game end versus waiting for the fourth quarter, right?

Like, it is, actually, in fact, every state has a law to set its vote by mail and doing vote by mail. That's not calling the game early. That's calling the game on time. And promoting that is destructive to our democracy. People should understand that, actually, every vote does count.

And it's really important that as a democracy. Like, I treasure people who I disagree with, their ability to vote. It's super important that we are in this together. And that's the legitimacy of the election results.

ANDY SERWER: We're talking mostly here about Facebook, and Twitter, and YouTube. But what about LinkedIn, Reid? Is LinkedIn immune from misinformation?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, no social media platform is completely immune because part of what you enable is you enable everyone to have a voice and to put something on. And one of the things that's a little unfortunate about them modern media ecosystem, which includes social media, is it reminds me of a Winston Churchill quote which is, a lie travels around the world three times before the truth has a chance to put its boots on.

And truth is slow in the way that it kind of works, and that's one of the things I think we need to kind of figure out as we benefit from increasing speed in communication and so forth. And so I think even LinkedIn has challenges with it.

Where it's easier for us because people tie their professional reputation, the theming is things about business. And so you don't tend to get-- like, we had a little bit of QAnon stuff because of people who put it on. You don't tend to get as much of the lackey QAnon stuff.

But we also had to kind of go, OK, this is not according to LinkedIn terms of service, so we're pulling this off. And so it has a little, but not as much as the other platforms have to contend with.

ANDY SERWER: So as we go into the Biden era, I'm curious as to what you think the direction and tenor of Washington, DC's desire to perhaps rein in or regulate the big tech platforms, what path that's going to take.

Because it's not at all clear cut. You've got Ted Cruz, David Cicilline, now Joe Biden, Senator Warner, people with very different political perspectives who seem to share distrust and anxiety about the platforms. But that's where the common ground ends, right?

REID HOFFMAN: So look, roughly speaking, I'm a-- this is not a no regulation point of view, but I am a very strong believer that we've now moved to a multipolar world. China will be building more and more of the technology platforms that matter in the coming years.

And actually, to some degree, I hope that there's other places. Like, one of the Greylock investments we have is this incubator called Entrepreneur First, which is building tech communities in Europe and in Singapore. So I hope for more of this.

But what that means is you don't disable your own player, right? You don't go, hey, let's try to do that. What you want to do is you want to shape them. You want to say, look, these outcomes, misinformation. Here is our social mandate for how we change that so we have more truth in the media ecosystem. Those kinds of things are important.

But the classic notion of an antitrust or a breakup, I think those are, generally speaking, going to be actually, in fact, a counter American health and prosperity. And by the way, I say that as my primary thing as an investor, as new startups, as competing with these large tech companies.

So it's not like an embodied interest. But actually, in fact, I think where we have maybe five tech giants today, I think five years from now, we're going to have 10 tech giants. And those competition between those tech giants is what create lots of space for startups to either get their initial base, or to grow into being the 11th, or to be bought by one of them.

And so that's part of the reason why I think actually, in fact, the antitrust isn't the right thing, but figuring out how to contribute the right way to the health of our society and global society is the right thing.

ANDY SERWER: Well, two questions here. So first of all, when you're talking about going from five to 10, are you talking about the other five being in China? And then also, what specifically, though, short of antitrust and breaking things up, would be your remedies?

REID HOFFMAN: So on the first-- actually, in fact, if you're including China, you're like five going to 25, right? So it is much larger. I was actually just talking about kind of the growth of companies like Airbnb and others as they establish on the stage.

And obviously, there's a bunch right now around Netflix, and Salesforce, and other kinds of things. So I think there's a range of these companies to become multipart technology platforms. And with China, you're going to see a ton more.

And then I think in terms of-- it's one of the things that I've actually started working on in 2019 and then I got very concerned about the 2020 election, so I'm going to get back to it soon. But it's kind of the question of, how do we build the full-- what are the tools and sets we can do to build kind of regulation of the outcomes we want, but don't try to enshrine the past? Allow adaptation in the future.

I'll give you one kind of like, microcosm example. Like, say you said, look, we don't want to have video depictions of live streams of terrorist assaults, or murderers, or anything else. So you say, what's the way you would regulate that?

Well, a simple way, like, if I was going to try to regulate, if I was in charge of regulating that today, what I would say is, OK, here's our law. It's $10,000 fine purview. And the companies have to self report, but they have to self report through their auditors. Like, the auditors have to say, this was actually, in fact, done well.

And so they self report and then we say, OK, so we assess the fines and we take whatever dollar amount. I've kind of pulled a number out of air. But take whatever dollar amount you want. That's the right thing. Because trying to go to zero seems kind of crazy.

And, by the way, people do individually, accidentally, terrifyingly do see live murders. So one person saw it or people saw it is not actually, in fact, society destabilizing. It's unfortunate and terrible, but not that. And then you set it.

And then, by the way, it then becomes the tech company's ability to try to figure out, OK, what do we do? Do we have AI that's scanning for it? Do we have a 15 second or five minute delay or what all.

As opposed to mandating it, which is what enshrines the past against the future, you're saying, here is our economic incentive to you to continue to iterate and solve this problem in the right way, right? And then enable that to happen.

And that's, I think, the kind of pattern that you generally need to see happening with technology because it moves so fast and we want to build to the solutions of which is the better solutions are in the future.

ANDY SERWER: I know you're Mr. AI here, so obviously, you think AI is part of the solution. But it's also pretty clear, I bet you'd admit, that it's not the 100% solution. You obviously need human oversight, human intervention, human action.

So I'm curious about your understanding, your thought process when it comes to mix and if you hire more people. I mean, Zuck has hired thousands, tens of thousands of more people to try to mitigate this, but then your margins go down. Although that hasn't seemed to impact those businesses much, right? How do you feel about that?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, so I think it's totally fine to hire a bunch more people. I mean, one of the things that we have is about these global businesses. This is, again, one of the reasons why the businesses that will succeed in this stuff tend to have a very large footprint, which is one of the reasons why I, again, tend to be not-- like, if you said you want these businesses to be American businesses, to not have an antitrust, like a breakup solution.

So yes, maybe you have to hire 10,000 people. But if you're serving up billions in the world, then actually, in fact, hiring 10,000 or 50,000 people, that actually, in fact, does work. And then, of course, again, as you're inventing in the future, one of the things that you tend to do is you say, well, how do we get AI tools that even make those people more efficient and more effective?

And by way, just on your AI point, it's actually, in fact, one of the things that I help stand up and I'm the chair of the advisory board is the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. Because precisely the whole question is, how do you have a AI that has very positive human impact? Whether it's jobs, whether it's equality, or kind of a fairness in society and all those things and make sure that we're doing all of those with these very complicated AI systems?

ANDY SERWER: That's a fascinating point there about the work you're doing at Stanford. I didn't know about that. That's really amazing. Interesting. I want to ask you about China a little bit more.

There are people who are suggesting that we're going to be entering a new Cold War with China and it's going to be based on a technology rivalry. I mean, not such a far fetched or crazy notion at all. I think it's really just a question of degree. In other words, how much coopetition will there be or how dystopian and fractured will the world be along these two ecosystems, if you will?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think this is one of the things that, again, kind of back to the politics, is great that we have a change in the White House. Because you both need competition, and Americans, winning, things that are important to us.

By the way, the spread of American platforms, the dying, the Chinese, those platforms are actually a terrible, bad idea. Because say, hey, buy American technology. We're going to be buying Chinese technology. We already are today.

IPhone is kind of a mixed. Designed in Cupertino, but built in China, as an example. And so I think that the important thing is to really focus on is coopetition. Unfortunately, a little bit of the kind of competitive rhetoric, the Chinese hawks, are like, they want China to fail.

China is an important part of the global economy. If China fails, we all fail. And so I think that that bridge building is really important, while still, of course, fiercely competing and making sure that China plays its fair and just role on the world stage.

Doesn't kind of pretend it's an emerging economy anymore, isn't allowed IP theft, that kind of thing, where it's like, no, no, you have to play. We have to have a collective set of rules that we all play together that allow the world to progress.

ANDY SERWER: Maybe just to drill down a little bit more here, Reid, but isn't a bifurcated technology, economic system sort of inevitable in the sense that you're going to have a situation where they're never going to let the US, say, social media platforms in?

I don't know what's going to happen with TikTok. That seems to have been forgotten now, which is fascinating. But when it comes to chips, when it comes to Huawei and competing, you know, against Ericsson and the Western companies, isn't that really going to get worse?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, I think it will get worse. But I think the important thing is to actually-- look, this is one of the things that I'm hopeful about in kind of a Biden administration An eternal thing is, have a technology strategy, right? Actually, in fact, be saying what are the things that we should be building to?

Because, for example, not giving up on the hardware and the chip side I think is super important. I think actually, in fact, doubling down on the things that where a lot of the deep tech AI platforms is happening over in China. The Chinese government wants to be in the lead in 2030.

Well, actually, in fact, the US ecosystems with universities, and the companies, and so forth, is in the lead today. Well, work on that. Try to maintain that. Try to make that happen. And I that's part of it. Now, I think what we'll see is we'll-- some stuff will be in China. Some stuff will be in the US. Some stuff will be in Europe.

That will be a good universe of interdependency because part of the whole-- what's awesome about capitalism, one of things is, make trade, not war. Like, as we have these interdependencies, those are actually very, very good for us in a stable world order.

And so I think we want that. But I do think that it's going to be-- look, it's going to be hard and there's going to be some definite collisions, fender benders, scratches, and it's going to take leadership to work through it.

ANDY SERWER: Let's talk about COVID, and the pandemic, and this time that we're living in, which is so crazy. But what it's done, it's exacerbated the divisions in society, not the least of which, say, were the banks, and the tech stocks, and tech companies in Silicon Valley from the rest of the US economy, never mind the rest of society.

So you had this just incredible increase in valuation of these companies now maybe coming back to Earth because of a vaccine. I mean, so what is your sort of top line thinking? Then we can drill down a little bit more after that.

REID HOFFMAN: Well, my top line thinking is, obviously, this last year is the difference between kind of reasonable government and terrible government. Because we paid trillions of dollars of debt, millions of job losses, and hundreds of thousands of lives that we didn't need to pay.

And anyone who looks at the numbers, you kind of say, OK, 5x the cases and the fatalities of the average of the rest of the world. Now, we've got some glimmerings of greatness. The Gates Foundation and companies, private enterprise going out and building vaccines at a rapid pace and all the rest of that. That's great.

But I think we need to return to a belief in science, a belief in expertise, a belief in, like Dr. Fauci, who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, is a very credible expert who's just a truth teller. It's a super important place for us to be as Americans, and that should never be politicized in any particular way.

Now, I think what that's going to come to is we're going to have another year of turbulence. Because as we figure out the kinds of things of, look, wearing a mask is part of how I'm caring for my fellow Americans, not spreading disease to them. We're going to need that.

Even as we do vaccines, I fear that we'll begin to politicize take the vaccine or not, versus the, no, no, no, my way of-- because people don't quite usually understand vaccines. They think vaccine is I'm immune. And actually, it isn't that. It's harder for me to get it.

So a lot of us have to take it to eliminate it. It's like a superpowered mask to eliminate it from the viral spread, what the experts call R0 as the incense. And we're going to need to do that. And why do we want to do that?

Well, because our productivity will be hit so much worse than basically all of these other countries. Like, than China, which, for example, I think Shanghai hasn't had a new case in like, 250 days, right? There's more cases in the White House than there is in Shanghai.

If we want to get back to an American economy, we need to get to a place where we have the disease under control and it's super important. So we should be accelerating towards that. And hopefully, by assembling experts, like that Biden has already assembled a group of great people, including someone who was one of the early whistleblowers under Trump, and say, hey, this is what we're going to pull together in order to solve this disease both for health, but also for the economy.

ANDY SERWER: But isn't it the case that sort of perversely, Reid, that when this vaccine or vaccines are out there, that the valuations of these tech companies will go down?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, some of them, and that's fine. I mean, look, the valuation of these tech companies are already so high that that's not a problem. So you've got to-- like, if the ones where investors think, oh, the only reason that's being so used is because of the pandemic, fine, we'd much rather get back to everyone going to work. And the valuation will still be more than high enough for everyone's happiness, including investors.

ANDY SERWER: So my understanding is that the VC world has been robust during this time. Is that the case? And if so, why?

REID HOFFMAN: Well, it's kind of a surprise. When we've looked at earlier kind of collisions, things that happened, including 2008 and so forth, all of this-- the VC market, generally speaking, have kind of retrenched, reserve the portfolio for the current companies, using other recessions, the internet boss and other things as a model.

And in this case, part of what happened is partially because of the LP money into the venture funds, the wide set of venture funds. I think it's because a lot of capital also thinks, OK, technology is the future, so capital around the world is looking for technology investments.

So all of that flowed in and so everyone went, well, actually, in fact, I can make this work. I can talk through Skype. I can talk through Teams. I can talk through Zoom. And I'll tell you, we at Greylock have been making a whole set of investments with teams and people we've never met, right? They've only been this little box on the screen.

Now, of course we still do the reference checking, and we still do our due diligence, and calling customers, and all the rest. But we're like, oh, look, there's-- and I think, by the way, a bunch of people are going, OK, the entrepreneurs are still like, well, we're not waiting. We're not hanging around for the pandemic.

We're building, and we're creating new things, and new available products. And at Greylock, we've been doing a lot of enterprise most recently, because we've seen all kinds of new enterprise opportunities. But there's obviously a whole range.

ANDY SERWER: That's so crazy. So you do enough due diligence so that when you finally meet this person maybe next summer you'll say, I didn't know you were tall. Everything else about you, I knew--

REID HOFFMAN: Yes, exactly.

ANDY SERWER: --or that kind of thing.

REID HOFFMAN: Exactly.

ANDY SERWER: One thing we haven't touched on that much, you mentioned inequality a little bit. And I want to ask what you're doing and what venture can specifically do to address racial and social bias.

REID HOFFMAN: So racial and social bias is one of the things we have. It's a stain on our entire society, and especially some areas like obviously tech and investing are, just by the numbers, clearly retrograde in this.

And so it's one of those places where you have to look at yourself and say, if I'm not part of the solution, then I'm part of the problem. And so Greylock, for example, we looked at this and said, look, the key thing is to make sure there's a whole bunch of great people of color, minority, other kind of things, disadvantaged minority talent out there.

We just need to build a network connectivity so that they have connectivity to investment if they're founders to these early companies, if they're kind of professionals and executives. And so we did that. So we said, OK, let's dive deep.

And we did a partnership with Management Leaders of Tomorrow, which, founded and CO by John Rice, who is the brother of Susan Rice, who has already spent well over a decade building these pathways for how do you identify great talent.

And now we're going to try to help map that talent into the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. And we're-- one of the things that we do at Greylock is we pride ourselves on being good partners with entrepreneurs, but even with other investors.

And we say, OK, let's try to make sure that that whole talent network is connected well throughout the entire Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. Because ultimately, that's how you get to kind of the fairness, to the justice.

Which is, you have those network pathways by which people can then find the right opportunities. And so that's one of n things that we're doing at Greylock in order to try to be kind of good protagonists of the future.

ANDY SERWER: I know you could probably talk about this for an hour or more. But what are a few things that you look for when you're trying to identify a successful startup, Reid?

REID HOFFMAN: So generally speaking, it can be different patterns. But the simple stuff is, oh my gosh, this could be an industry transforming company where the time is now. Sometimes because of technology change, sometimes because of market change, other kinds of things.

That the founder has enough of the raw knowledge to get moving, and is a learner, and has that raw kind of grit and adaptability to go through all of the different phases that these startups go through. Like, the example in my last book, ""Blitzscaling,"" I kind of described those five phases of size.

And the rules change at each phase of size. Like, how you run the company, what management looks like, are you multithreaded, single threaded? And then you can do all that. And then where do you look at relative to competition?

Because one of the really fundamental things, which I just did in my most recent kind of ""Greymatter"" podcast and essay, was that competition, like, what does the competition look like, is really central to how you do it.

So that's the suite at which you look at. And then that suite, you kind of go, OK, and then it's art and science. You can't just kind of pencil the numbers. It isn't just do a DCS analysis. It's like, yeah, I think so.

ANDY SERWER: Right, right. Great. And finally, Reid, you have seen millions of profiles on LinkedIn. And so I'm curious, what advice do you have for people who are applying to jobs online right now amid COVID-19 and how do they stand out from the competition?

REID HOFFMAN: So I think that some of the things are put extra energy into it. Like, for example, one of the features, a small thing on LinkedIn is I like having references. Having, like-- but even if you're mailings say, hey, here's three people from-- like, you would say, here's three people who would be references for me and here's the link to their LinkedIn profile.

So people are, OK, showing that different thing. Like, another thing that I've kind of encouraged both companies individuals to do is while, generally speaking, I think recording a video interview of yourself in a normal thing is probably not that useful.

In this time of COVID, it is very useful, right? Because people are sitting, watching screens all the time. It's like, OK, watch another video. So record a little video about why you're interested in this job, who you are, and here's my link to my LinkedIn profile or wherever you're kind of storing your professional credentials. I think that's very helpful.

And then, of course, always try to use your network so that people understand that you are hardworking, collaborative, and other kinds of things which are the attributes you generally only get through references or network.

ANDY SERWER: Reid Hoffman, thank you so much for your time and best of luck to you.

REID HOFFMAN: Thank you, Andy. Always a pleasure.

244,2020-11-09T00:17:52+00:00,Microsoft Sets Sights on Sony’s Home Turf in Console Clash,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.

In the battle of the next-generation gaming machines, two key players are moving in different directions.

Microsoft Corp. is making a serious attempt to attract fans in Japan with its new consoles and network services. Meanwhile, Tokyo-based Sony Corp. moved its PlayStation business headquarters to California in 2016 and has built the U.S. into its largest single market.

New Xbox and PlayStation devices launching this week will likely face an uphill battle in Japan, where Nintendo Co.’s Switch enjoys dominance with a family-friendly lineup of games.

But Microsoft’s targeting of the world’s third-largest video-game market -- including with services that can be accessed across a variety of devices -- could potentially yield strong results. As the Xbox has virtually zero presence in the country, there’s plenty of room for it to increase its share.

“The Xbox has a chance to make Japan its second-largest market after the U.S. if it takes the right steps for years to come,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Sony’s attention is drifting away and fans have started to notice that.”

Sony shares rose as much as 1.2% in Tokyo trading and have gained about 24% this year.

Sony has placed more importance on the U.S. market after the PlayStation 4’s disappointing performance in Japan, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.

Sony’s PlayStation 5 Is Beating Xbox in the Online Black Market

Global sales of the PS4 rose to more than 113 million from the PS3’s 87 million, according to Sony data. But the console sold fewer than 10 million units in Japan, less than its predecessor, according to Famitsu, a Japanese video-game magazine. The U.S., meanwhile, accounts for 35% of the video-game unit’s revenue, compared with 10% for Japan, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst Damian Thong.

Any suggestion that Sony is shifting its focus away from Japan is incorrect and doesn’t reflect the company’s strategy, spokeswoman Natsumi Atarashi said. She noted that the PlayStation 5 is launching first in Japan and said “our home market remains of utmost importance.”

A senior figure inside PlayStation headquarters in San Mateo, California, said the U.S. side was frustrated by the failure of the Japan marketing team to sell as many PlayStation 4 units as expected. The person asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.

As a result, Japan has been sidelined in planning the PlayStation 5’s promotion, according to several PlayStation staff in Japan. Employees in Tokyo said they’ve been left awaiting instructions from California.

Japan-based developer support teams have been reduced by as much as a third from their peak, and the rolling contracts of a number of game creators at PlayStation’s Japan Studio, one of the unit’s oldest in-house software ateliers, haven’t been renewed, former employees said. The U.S. office believes the PlayStation business doesn’t need games that only do well in Japan, employees in the California headquarters said.

Sony Surges After Increase in Forecast on Gaming Demand

The PlayStation 5’s two main online promotional events both took place at 5 a.m. in Tokyo -- making them more accessible to American and European fans -- and lacked Japanese translation for some parts. The company also decided to standardize its PS5 control scheme so that Japanese players would have to use X to confirm and O to cancel, like the rest of the world. That reverses a 26-year tradition in a country where circles signify positives and crosses mark negatives.

Local retailers said they haven’t received many more first-batch PlayStation 5 units than they did of the PlayStation 3, which had a limited initial production run.

“It’s analyst consensus that PlayStation no longer sees the Japan market as important,” Morningstar Research analyst Kazunori Ito said. “If you want to know their take on the Japanese market, you need to ask about it because otherwise Sony wouldn’t talk about it.”

TV ownership among Japanese households has been falling for years, according to government data. That makes the market less attractive, according to Ace’s Yasuda. In order to play games on the PlayStation, a user must have a TV or monitor, though some titles are also available to play on PCs.

Serkan Toto, a game consultant in Tokyo, said the PlayStation 5 should sell fewer units than its predecessor.

“Many PlayStation 4 owners in Japan would eventually move to the PlayStation 5, but that would largely depend on how strong the PlayStation team in Tokyo will be in pushing the needs of Japanese customers to the American headquarters,” he said. “Considering the current power balance between the U.S. and Japan, I can’t expect much, unfortunately.”

To be sure, the PlayStation 4’s worldwide success suggests Sony’s strategy hasn’t been detrimental. Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said on Oct. 28 that the company would be able to sell more than 7.6 million PlayStation 5 units in the first five months, more than the popular PlayStation 4 achieved in the same timeframe. The long-term goal is to sell as many units as the PS4, Totoki said.

And the company’s PlayStation Plus subscription service, for owners of Sony consoles, reported a record increase in subscribers during the period of pandemic lockdowns.

But Microsoft, which is launching its next-generation consoles in Japan on Tuesday, the same day it does so in the rest of the world, sees an opportunity in the country’s market. Microsoft didn’t start selling the Xbox One in Japan until almost a year after the U.S., which contributed to its disappointing sales in the Asian country.

The challenge facing Microsoft is steep. The Xbox One accounted for just 0.1% of console sales in Japan this year through Nov. 1, compared with 10.1% for the PlayStation 4 and 89.8% for Nintendo’s Switch, according to Famitsu.

Microsoft is betting its Xbox Series S, the smallest Xbox ever, will help turn the tide. Previous consoles were criticized as being too large for Japanese living rooms, Ace’s Yasuda said.

The U.S. company has been stepping up discussions with Japan-based game developers about releasing titles on the Xbox, said Sarah Bond, who oversees relations with game creators across the Microsoft gaming ecosystem.

Koei Tecmo Games Co. is one of those firms. Hisashi Koinuma, president of the Japanese publisher, said he’s willing to consider releasing more games for the Xbox if the U.S. company shows continued interest in Japan.

On top of that, there’s evidence Microsoft is seeking to make acquisitions in the country, though it hasn’t yet landed a deal with a big name there. Several Japan-based game developers, from small to big, said it had approached them about buying their businesses. They asked not to be identified as the talks were private, and declined to give details on how the discussions went.

When asked about potential purchases of Japanese companies, Jeremy Hinton, head of Xbox operations in Asia, said Microsoft is always open to discussions with creators that are a good fit. He said acquisitions are a possibility but there are no announcements to share at this time.

“Japan has long been an isolated part of the Xbox world, but it appears Microsoft is changing that landscape,” Katsuhiko Hayashi, representative of Famitsu Group, said of Microsoft’s efforts to target the country.

The focus isn’t just on selling consoles. Hinton said the company is also banking on winning subscribers to the Game Pass Ultimate service, which includes the xCloud game-streaming offering. This service, which can be used for other devices as well as the Xbox, offers more than 100 all-you-can-play games for a fixed monthly fee and will seek to entice the country’s growing cohort of mobile gamers.

While Japan has fallen behind China and the U.S. in the size of its video-game market, Microsoft said Japan is still biggest when measured by per-capita spending.

But questions remain about whether the U.S. company will be able to penetrate it given its lack of success in the past, according to game-industry consultant Toto.

“Microsoft will continue to have a hard time in Japan, and I don’t see any reason why the next Xbox should do better in Japan than the previous models,” he said. “All signs point that for the next years, Nintendo will stay king in Japan, and I really don’t understand why Microsoft is still so obsessed with Japan.”

Whether he’s right -- or whether the U.S. company can prise open the door to a market that has long eluded it -- remains to be seen.

“Microsoft won’t be able to take Sony’s position as No. 2 in Japan anytime soon, but at least it has started to make changes,” Ace’s Yasuda said. “A big tide always starts with a small change.”

246,2020-11-06T01:58:12+00:00,Alibaba’s Slowing Sales Spook Investors On Edge Over Ant,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s revenue grew at its slowest pace on record for a September quarter, underscoring how the e-commerce giant’s post-pandemic rebound is starting to plateau.

Asia’s largest corporation reported a 30% rise in sales in the September quarter, in line with expectations but down a tad from the previous three months. That did little to reassure investors worried about the tightening regulatory scrutiny that forced Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. to call off its $35 billion IPO. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang would only say it’s evaluating the impact on its business from more stringent rules governing its 32%-owned sister company.

Alibaba’s shares sank as much as 4.3% in early Hong Kong trading, extending a volatile streak that began with a selloff of more than $60 billion earlier this week. The company enjoys a close relationship with Ant, whose Alipay mobile wallet anchors the majority of Alibaba’s e-commerce transactions and whose microlending services drive consumption. In response to a question about the extent to which Ant loans lead to online shopping, executives said the company doesn’t quantify that traffic.

“As Ant Group’s major shareholder, Alibaba is actively evaluating the impact on our business in response to the recently proposed changes in the fintech regulatory environment, and will take appropriate measures accordingly,” Zhang told analysts on a conference call.

Alibaba booked almost 4.7 billion yuan of profit from Ant in the September quarter, a big chunk of its overall bottom line. The e-commerce giant reported revenue for the three months ended September of 155.1 billion yuan ($23.4 billion), meeting the 154.8 billion yuan average of estimates. Profit fell 60% to 28.8 billion yuan from a year earlier, when it booked a one-time gain from the acquisition of its stake in Ant.

Alibaba had benefited from stronger sales in its home market, which had led the global recovery from Covid-19. Gross domestic product grew 4.9% last quarter, making China the world’s only major growth engine. The e-commerce titan is banking on more than a quarter of a million brands, increased discounting and technologies like livestreamed selling to draw consumers to its annual blockbuster Single’s Day shopping festival, which culminates next week.

“The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch. “E-commerce is the only sector that will actually benefit from coronavirus, simply due to the fact that a lot of normal consumption is shifted from offline to online.”

Alibaba’s shares have gained more than 60% from their Covid-19-era lows in March and touched a record high in October when Ant priced its IPO. Retail and institutional investors had flocked to the record $35 billion-plus IPO, betting that Ant will overcome high valuations, regulatory headwinds and rising competition to reshape the future of global finance.

Excluding the Covid-hit March quarter, the 29% increase in Alibaba’s core commerce business was the slowest in more than five years as consumers put off purchases ahead of Single’s Day. The closely watched customer management revenue for China commerce rose 20% in the quarter. Core commerce should expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23% from 2021 to 2023, CGS-CIMB analysts including Lei Yang wrote.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

Alibaba may continue to benefit from accelerated user and merchant adoption of online grocery shopping, cloud computing and remote-work applications, driven by China’s Covid-19 outbreak. Its domestic retail marketplaces have fully recovered from the pandemic. Longer-term sales and profit growth could be driven by global expansion and the monetization of newer business segments such as logistics, media and entertainment.

Revenue for Alibaba’s cloud division jumped 60% in the quarter, driven by demand from customers in the internet, finance and retail industries. The unit is forecast to turn profitable for the first time ever in the year ending March, a target that was reiterated by Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu on Thursday. That will be a milestone for the decade-old business, which competes with the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp. and Google globally and is fending off upstarts like Tencent Holdings Ltd. at home.

Alibaba is keeping up a steady pace of acquisitions to drive growth. The company teamed up with Richemont to jointly invest $1.1 billion in luxury e-commerce retailer Farfetch Ltd. to tap on the burgeoning demand for highend foreign goods among China’s middle class, according to a statement Thursday. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday the country may import more than $22 trillion worth of products over the next decade.

In October, Alibaba also agreed to take a stake in Swiss duty-free giant Dufry AG, a move that Zhang said would be a “very important step” in helping the company grow its retail travel business as China develops domestic free trade ports. And to capitalize on the boom in online groceries, it last month paid about $3.6 billion to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., taking control of one of China’s largest hypermarts to try and fend off rivals like JD.com Inc., upstart Pinduoduo Inc. and Tencent-backed Meituan.

Coronavirus Continues to Boost Videogame Sales: 4 Winners

The video gaming industry has found a blessing in disguise in the coronavirus pandemic that is keeping people indoors most of the time. With not many options for entertainment except for streaming videos and music online, videogames have emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries. And if the situation continues like this, this holiday season will witness a surge in videogame sales.

According to market research firm NDP Group, COVID-19 became a blessing in disguise for video game companies, with an increasing number of Americans shelling out on buying video games. The holiday season has always proved to be great for retailers, and videogame makers are likely to witness a record surge in sales this holiday season.

Videogame Sales Set to Soar This Holiday Season

NPD Group has forecast consumer spending on video games to touch $13.4 billion this holiday season. This suggests an increase of 24% from the previous year.

Gamers are mostly going to spend on console hardware, gamepads, headsets, mobile and post-launch console on both PC and console.

NPD projects overall consumer spending on videogames in the United States to surpass $20 billion this year.

Story continues

The firm predicts that a few console games will outperform competitors this holiday season particularly the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. Also, the firm predicts that Nintendo Co.’s Switch will go on to become the hottest selling holiday gifting item.

Needless to say, videogames will continue to dominate the entertainment space at least this year or till the time a vaccine is out given that stepping out of the house bears the risk of spreading the virus.

The jury in Tyler, Texas, reached its verdict in about 90 minutes. It was asked to decide only how much Apple owes VirnetX in royalties for VPN on Demand, a feature that allows users access to virtual private networks. An appeals court had upheld an infringement finding regarding VPN on Demand.

The companies have been embroiled in litigation for a decade. VirnetX, which said its inventions stemmed from technology it developed for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, argued that both VPN on Demand and Apple’s FaceTime features were using its inventions.

VirnetX had told the jury it was entitled to more than $700 million. Apple had countered that it owed about $113 million, claiming the royalty rate should be no more than 19 cents per unit. The jury settled on 84 cents per unit.

“We thank the jury for their time and appreciate their consideration but are disappointed with the verdict and plan to appeal,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. “This case has been going on for over a decade, with patents that are unrelated to the core operations of our products and have been found to be invalid by the patent office. Cases like this only serve to stifle innovation and harm consumers.”

A representative of VirnetX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict.

Shares of VirnetX soared by as much as 21.8% in after-hours trading and were at $6.64 at 7:46 p.m. in New York. Apple’s stock was at $108.53 after finishing the trading day at $108.86.

Apple previously paid VirnetX $454 million because of a verdict over earlier versions of the features. Apple has launched an aggressive campaign to invalidate VirnetX patents, but its victories at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office hadn’t come in time to avoid its losses in district court.

This trial involved a different case with newer versions of VPN on Demand. The trial was required after an appeals court threw out part of the infringement finding, saying the company had redesigned its FaceTime feature to avoid VirnetX patents so the $503 million damages awarded in this case had to be recalculated.

Story continues

VirnetX, which hasn’t been able to gain traction with its own Gabriel software, relies on patent royalties for its revenue. Prior to Apple, its biggest payment came from a $200 million settlement with Microsoft Corp. in 2010.

While it’s looking for another big payout from Apple, the company is fighting allegations that Chief Executive Officer Kendall Larsen’s family makes up a fifth of the company’s 21 employees and the firm is “plagued by nepotism, waste, and corporate governance failures,” according to a complaint pending in Delaware Chancery Court.

VirnetX has asked to have the Chancery Court case dismissed, saying the “litany of gripes” by the owner of five shares of the company’s stock is all public information that doesn’t involve any self-dealing.

The case is VirnetX Inc. v. Apple Inc. 12-855, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Marshall).

257,2020-10-30T12:44:12+00:00,Coronavirus Continues to Boost Videogame Sales: 4 Winners,"The video gaming industry has found a blessing in disguise in the coronavirus pandemic that is keeping people indoors most of the time. With not many options for entertainment except for streaming videos and music online, videogames have emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries. And if the situation continues like this, this holiday season will witness a surge in videogame sales.

According to market research firm NDP Group, COVID-19 became a blessing in disguise for video game companies, with an increasing number of Americans shelling out on buying video games. The holiday season has always proved to be great for retailers, and videogame makers are likely to witness a record surge in sales this holiday season.

Videogame Sales Set to Soar This Holiday Season

NPD Group has forecast consumer spending on video games to touch $13.4 billion this holiday season. This suggests an increase of 24% from the previous year.

Gamers are mostly going to spend on console hardware, gamepads, headsets, mobile and post-launch console on both PC and console. This year has so far been great for videogame makers and if things continue to be like this. NPD projects overall consumer spending on videogames in the United States to surpass $20 billion this year.

Pandemic Benefiting Gaming Industry

According to the NPD Group’s 2020 Gamer Segmentation Report, Americans are now spending 14 hours on average per week versus 12 hours till 2018. The United States presently has 244 million video games, which has increased by 30 million over the past two years.

The firm predicts that a few console games will outperform competitors this holiday season particularly the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. Also, the firm predicts that Nintendo Co.’s NTDOY Switch will go on to become the hottest selling holiday gifting item.

Needless to say, videogames will continue to dominate the entertainment space at least this year or till the time a vaccine is out given that stepping out of the house bears the risk of spreading the virus. Moreover, with the recent spike in coronavirus cases, it is likely that outdoor entertainment will not resume anytime soon and video games will make up for that.

259,2020-10-30T03:30:24+00:00,"In China, Big Tech Isn't the Enemy. It's the Strategy","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Beijing’s goal of building a self-reliant technology industry has been elevated to become a strategic pillar, part of the latest five-year plan setting out top national priorities. This means that China is redoubling efforts to wean itself off foreign companies, with the result likely to be a cohort of domestic giants and a slow freeze-out of overseas competitors.

Just as the U.S. government starts looking to rein in, or even break up, big technology companies in the belief they have too much power, China is going in the opposite direction. We should expect to see more money, more policy favoritism, and more attention from party cadres aimed at ensuring the establishment of big successful chip and software firms.

The Fifth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's 19th Central Committee wrapped up Thursday by tasking the nation to, among other things, develop self-reliance and build its technological power.The result will be a more insular approach to industry and trade as Beijing strengthens a robust domestic market for those up-and-coming heroes to ply their wares.

Foreign companies — notably in semiconductors, software or materials — that still believe China is a viable long-term business are kidding themselves. Only those supplying crucial products and services not available locally will have any shot at sustained market access, and even then only until a domestic alternative comes along.

Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. should take note. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. ought to be wary. Meanwhile, suppliers of the equipment, chemicals and software used to design and build chips should enjoy eating at the trough now, because the good times won’t last, if Beijing can help it.

The likes of ASML Holding NV, Tokyo Electron Ltd., and Synopsys Inc. might see some growth years as Chinese companies lean on them to supply the core ingredients of a semiconductor industry, if the U.S. administration doesn’t get in their way to further stymie China’s advancement. But they’d be foolish to not understand that local rivals, backed by Beijing, are doing everything possible to replicate their products.

Story continues

Over the past decade, the government has done a lot to improve intellectual property enforcement and secure economic rights over technological innovation. Nonetheless, it would be a brave Chinese prosecutor or judge who sides with a big Western company over a local upstart in any case of alleged IP theft.

I believe we’ve yet to see the next era of national champions emerge. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have been the backbone of China’s internet development. Beijing would want to see their equivalents in semiconductors come forth.

Huawei Technologies Co. fits the role, a fact that Washington recognizes by attempting to impede the Shenzhen company’s chip division HiSilicon. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. will also play a part, but after two decades it has still failed to match rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or United Microelectronics Corp. Then there’s a collection of state-backed chipmakers such as those in the orbit of the esteemed Tsinghua University.

Yet the Alibaba of chips may not yet be born.

It could be bubbling away in a small Shenzhen office, helmed by former HiSilicon execs determined not to give up their semiconductor dreams despite Washington’s pressure. Or the topic of Zoom calls among locked-down postgrads finishing up their American degrees and planning to return home. Or in the bank balance of a Taiwanese engineer, enticed by the promise of vast riches, after a decade of toiling away at TSMC.

Whoever the next big Chinese tech giant is, you can be sure that Beijing has the money and determination to make sure it succeeds. At all costs.

261,2020-10-28T21:01:00+00:00,"Blackrock, Bezos And Musk Charging Ahead in this $30 Trillion Mega-Trend","A massive $250 billion has poured into ESG index funds since August, making ESG an investing megatrend that’s soared over 733% in just two years and has had over $30 trillion invested globally.

This is Big Capital’s new safe haven and some of the largest names in finance and tech from Goldman Sachs, to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are investing heavily.

ESG is considered a less risky and increasingly lucrative corner of Wall Street.

The multi-trillion-dollar reality is that tech and ESG are now inextricably linked.

And they are massively outperforming the market.

The holy grail of this new trend, therefore, should be a solid ESG platform combined with an impressive tech ecosystem.

And now, there’s a company that’s managed to do just that. Facedrive (TSXV:FD; OTC:FDVRF)—the Canadian tech darling that’s been stealing headlines across multiple sectors.

It’s a company that’s grasped the enormity of this megatrend.

It knows what Big Capital—like the $7 trillion finance giant BlackRock —wants.

It understands that big money is looking for more places to park on the in-demand ESG playing field.

And it doesn’t want a limited, one-off opportunity.

It wants an entire ecosystem of ESG tech offerings with limitless verticals.

That’s why Facedrive, one of the most impressively ambitious innovators to have come out of Canada’s Waterloo ‘Technology Triangle’ (aka the new ‘Silicon Valley’) - has created, launched, and exceptionally branded 6 entire ESG divisions in just one year.

It’s been hot on the acquisition trail for months, and its latest grab was a game-changer:

Two Huge Disruptors in Two Months

In September, Facedrive scooped up Chicago-based Steer, an EV subscription service that aims to upend the $5 trillion global transportation industry, in a deal that includes a $2-million strategic investment by energy giant Exelon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC. Steer

The pioneer of carbon-offset ride-sharing in Canada, Facedrive—behind the wheel of Steer—plans to completely change the way people view car ownership.

Story continues

Anyone who wanted but couldn’t afford an EV before, can now afford an EV ride, with Steer. That means Steer and its heavy-weight owners and backers will be disrupting industry segments on multiple levels.

Exelon’s (NASDAQ:EXC) market cap is ~$41 billion … and it’s not the only huge market-cap company whose radar Facedrive is pinging: There’s also a tie-in to ecommerce king Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ….

Steer is at the crossroads where $25 trillion meets:

The $5 trillion IT industry The $12 trillion digital economy The $8 trillion auto industry

And it’s all boosted by the fastest-growing megatrend of the year—ESG investing.

But Steer is just the most recent move by Facedrive, the tech giant’s previous deal was arguably even bigger.

In August, Facedrive acquired Tally Technologies, the high-tech major league sports predicting startup founded by NFL superstar Russel Wilson.

Tally came out of TraceMe, a celebrity content app founded by Wilson with early-in investors from the biggest tech companies in the world and acquired by Nike last year.

And that acquisition turned some of the biggest names in the tech industry into Facedrive shareholders … because the transaction was a share exchange that saw Facedrive inject $1M in cash in Tally and $2M in Facedrive shares.

Now, Tally plans to revolutionize major league sports with “gamification” and online fan engagement.

Gamified for ultimate fan engagement, this major league sports platform will now be free-to-play and predictive.

That means new revenue potential for major leagues sports, which is exactly why Tally has already been chosen by the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB as the premier tech solution.

All-Inclusive Tech on the Front Lines of COVID-19

There’s hardly a better “impact” investing element to add to your ESG portfolio than a contact tracing app designed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic with its very own line of wearables …

The company’s TraceSCAN contact-tracing technology is positioned to help save the tourism industry, which is facing $1 trillion in losses due to the pandemic and is expected to shed 100 million jobs before the year is out worldwide.

Aviation giant Air Canada is already on board.

On October 7th, Air Canada signed a deal with Facedrive Inc. (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) to launch a pilot project for its employees using proprietary TraceSCAN technology.

TraceSCAN Wearables could help the tourism industry deal with COVID. Facedrive combines complex algorithms in an AI-enabled mobile application with wearable devices built on the industry standard nRF52 Bluetooth chipset.

That means it can reach those millions of workers around the world, from construction and medical to education and security, who can’t operate with a phone in hand 24/7, as well as the at-risk elderly.

It’s fully mobile COVID-19 detection on a wristband, in a tag worn around the neck or in a pocket pod. And it intends to get us back to work, and back to fun--safely. FD

Air Canada isn’t the only major airline taking the TraceSCAN plunge...

The Government of Ontario lent its support to TraceSCAN back in July because it’s the only feasible technology that will help get masses of government employees back to work without spreading COVID-19.

And now, talks with other airlines are in motion because the industry is facing more than $84 billion in losses … so, the news flow is expected to be fast and momentous.

The Tech Company That Has It All

Even before it acquired Steer with the aim to change the way we view car ownership …

And before it jumped into Tally, the innovative tech that creates major sports revenue verticals for our interactive, engaged future …

Facedrive already had 5 ESG divisions, making it a one-stop-shop for multi-industry tech-driven ESG.

From its pioneering carbon-neutral ride-sharing and long-distance carpooling platform, food and pharmacy deliveries and COVID contact-trading to its own celebrity-branded merch marketplace (think: Will Smith’s Bel Air Athletics) and a blockbuster social distancing trivia and social engagement app, Facedrive has the kind of verticals the new big money is looking for.

Until now, Facedrive’s ESG platform has been stealing headlines across industries in Canada…

But the Steer deal plants it firmly in the United States, where the next big push is about to take place.

Big names have already tied into this wide-ranging tech play … from energy giant Exelon to Air Canada …

There’s been no faster news flow coming out of the Toronto Stock Exchange than this …

And the next big name to sign on to any one of these tech deals is likely to have serious impact.

Some other companies looking to capitalize on the sustainability push:

Facebook (FB) has truly taken the ESG trend to heart. It has dedicated a lot of resources on constructing more sustainable work environments. It's building designs integrate a variety of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all items taken in on-site. Not only that, it also focuses on its workforce, with equal opportunity hiring policies, ample time off, and much more.

Facebook is also taking an ingenious approach in its goal to cut back its carbon footprint. Its massive data centers are some of the most efficient on the planet. And it's only beginning. By the end of this year, Facebook intends to have all of its data centers running on 100% green energy.

Microsoft (MSFT) is another key tech giant integrating sustainability into its business model. Microsoft is going above and beyond in its carbon emissions promise. It is aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. Not just is the tech giant taking a major role in minimizing its carbon emissions, but it is also at the forefront of a technological wave that is actively helping other companies control their emissions.

Microsoft has built many new technologies to assist and assess the impact of different companies on the environment, helping collect data to better comprehend where and how the world can become greener. In addition, Microsoft is creating tools to better control water use and curb the world's growing waste issues.

Not to be outdone, Google (GOOGL) is fixated on raising the bar for the smart use of the world's dwindling resources. Like Facebook, Google is developing sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and office environments. It is likewise leveraging artificial intelligence to create a system that will help the world use energy in a more efficient manner.

Google is also concentrated on building a sustainable supply chain. It is dedicated to enhancing the lives of everyone linked to its products, from its data centers to truck drivers and beyond. Additionally, it is actively decreasing its ecological impact by working with suppliers to offer them the tools and tech they need to become more energy efficient.

NextEra Energy (NEE), the world leader in solar and wind producer, is playing a crucial role in the course towards sustainability. In fact, in 2018, the business was the top capital investor in green energy facilities and the 5th biggest investor across all sectors.

In addition to its huge influence on global climate change, it has a plan to invest another $55 billion in American energy facilities in the next 2 years. All while keeping a firm dedication to minimize its reliance on foreign oil. Since 2001, it has detached itself from foreign oil almost entirely, announcing a 98% decline over the past twenty years. Much more enticing, however, is its dedication to developing investor value. Over the past 15 years, investors have seen 945% returns.

We can’t talk about ESG without mentioning Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA).There’s a reason Tesla has performed so well this year. Investors love Elon Musk’s vision. As one of the world’s most innovative car manufacturers, it has single-handedly made electric vehicles cool. Its slick design is beloved across the world. In fact, it’s almost impossible to NOT see a Tesla in cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco.

Though Tesla has received some poor marks for its workplace health and safety due to a few incidents of employees feeling overworked and under-appreciated compared to its peers, Tesla scores very high on pollution prevention and corporate governance.

Canadian business are doing their part:

Stars Group Inc (TSX:TSGI) is a world leader in the online and mobile gaming industry. With a focus on maintaining high regulatory standards while simultaneously offering a wide range of products across multiple platforms, Stars has solidified its place among the gaming hierarchy.

In December, Stars Group secured a major partnership with the National Basketball Association in order to use data and league marks across their digital sports betting offerings.

Scott Kaufman-Ross, Head of Fantasy & Gaming, NBA explained, ""This dynamic partnership will be another way to create authentic fan engagement with league logos and official NBA betting data, while leveraging Stars' global expertise to further optimize the fan experience.

ePlay Digital Inc. (CSE:EPY) creates technology that helps TV networks, esports teams and leagues and even venues cut through the noise to reach their target audience. The company brings together multiple platforms to create engagement across social media, traditional media, streaming, and more. With a team built from sports, esports, and gaming experts, ePlay knows the video game industry inside and out. That’s why they’ve secured partnerships with companies including Time Warner Cable, ESPN, Sony Pictures, AXS TV, Intel, AXN, Fiat, CBS, Cineplex, and others.

Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR) is major player in the Canadian telecoms sector. It owns a ton of infrastructure throughout Canada and its cloud services and open-source projects look to address some of the biggest issues that its customers might face before the customers even face them.

As online gaming depends on solid internet connections, Shaw will likely become a backdoor benefactor in increased online activity.

Telus Corporation (TSX:T) is Canada’s second largest internet provider, serving over 8 million Canadians from coast to coast. Though it’s not producing its own content, it is carving out its own path in the industry thanks to its innovative approach to technology and investments across multiple sectors.

Like Shaw, Telus will be another company to watch as gamers, and the general population, turn to their phones and computers for entertainment.

Pollard Banknote Ltd. (TSX:PBL)

Pollard Banknote is one of the world’s largest instant scratch-off lottery suppliers for over 30 years, distributing tickets to over 60 lottery and charitable gaming organizations across the globe. With top-tier marketing, new design developments and other innovative measures, Pollard has solidified its position as one of the greats.

One way that Pollard sets itself apart from the competition is its social media presence. Pollard has worked hard to leverage new media outlets including Facebook and Twitter to really up its marketing game…and its efforts show.

262,2020-10-23T19:13:48+00:00,Electoral Implications For Leveraged Tech ETF,"Plenty of sectors are in electoral crosshairs this year, technology chief among them. The S&P 500's largest sector weight is a leadership group again in 2020, but there are implications for it come Election Day.

What Happened

Those implications make the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL) a credible post-election idea. TECL attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, a benchmark that's essentially an ode to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as that duo combine for more than 44% of the index's weight.

As has been widely documented, some titans of tech are drawing the ire of politicians on both sides of the aisle, but the conventional wisdom is that a victory by former Vice President Joe Biden would take some of the heat off the sector.

Why It's Important

That will probably prove to be true if Biden wins, but there are reasons to consider TECL, including intra-tech rotations.

“If you are long-duration technology – SaaS, payment processors, FAANG – you do not believe rotation is sustainable. Evidence of that view is best represented in the 8% bounce in the NASDAQ-100 Index (NDX) since the week of September 25,” writes Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous. “The opposing view is that cyclical technology, value names, and GARP stocks should benefit from a more balanced portfolio into the Presidential Election, especially if Biden wins. He is more likely to break up the monopoly names.”

Assuming Biden pursues the breaking up monopolies angle, TECL's bearish counterpart, the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS), could come into focus. However, that thesis probably doesn't account for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a friend of Silicon Valley, being Biden's running mate.

What's Next

Monopoly breaking is hard and even if President Trump scores the upset, there are no guarantees he'll have the political capital to wage anything more than verbal war against tech giants.

Story continues

That is to say even if he does pull victory from the jaws of defeat, TECL should still shape up nicely after Election Day. Plus, there are more technical reasons that could be the case.

“Regarding the old generals – Oracle, Cisco, Intel, etc. – many of the charts are constructive,” said Azous.

Those names and other mature tech fare reside in TECL's underlying index.

263,2020-10-23T18:51:09+00:00,Long-Term Investors Can Consider Investing in Nokia,"Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone event on Oct. 13 has made many investors more interested in the shares of companies that are involved in the 5G space. One such name is Nokia stock. Dark clouds over Nokia (NOK) brand name on top of a building in Helsinki, Finland

Source: RistoH / Shutterstock.com

Recent research by Nokia and Nokia Bell Labs determined that “5G-enabled industries have the potential to add $8 trillion to global GDP by 2030, as COVID-19 accelerates medium and long-term digital investment and value creation… Companies at an advanced level of 5G adoption were the only group to experience a net increase in productivity (+10%) following COVID-19, and the only group able to maintain or increase customer engagement during the pandemic.”

The report continues, “across 8 economies – Australia, Germany, Finland, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the UK and the US – 50% of companies are at the midway level on 5G readiness, between initial planning, trials and deployment, compared to just 7% that are classed as 5G mature.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Now investors may wonder if they should buy the shares of Nokia, one of the companies that is leading the global deployment of 5G networks. The company is expected to report earnings at the end of October. Between now and then, Nokia stock may be choppy, especially given the increased volatility levels of the stock market during this busy earnings season. However, long-term investors may regard dips by Nokia as a good opportunity to buy its shares. Here’s why.

Nokia’s Q2 Results

Finland-based Nokia makes telecom-grade networking equipment. In 2013, it sold its fading mobile-phone business to Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT). Then management changed course, re-positioning the company as a networking firm, and, more recently, as a 5G-equipment business.

7 Airline Stocks to Buy on Pelosi Stimulus Hopes

The company released its Q2 results in late July. Last quarter, Nokia’s sales dropped 11% year-over-year to 5.09 billion euros. On the other hand, its profit, excluding certain items, came in at 316 million euros, compared to 258 million euros during the same period a year earlier. Investors were pleased with Nokia’s cash flow and profitability.

Story continues

Over the past several quarters, Nokia has been increasing its large-scale capital investments, particularly in 5G networking. Its most important clients are communication service providers. The company has signed several important deals to introduce 5G networks in a number of countries.

For instance, in late September, it signed a major 5G equipment agreement with BT (OTCMKTS:BTGOF), the U.K.’s biggest telecom company. In October, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) announced it had chosen  Nokia to provide private 5G networks outside the U.S., mainly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. NASA has also recently selected Nokia as a partner to build the first LTE/4G communications system on the moon.

Analysts believe that, going forward, the proliferation of 5G technology will likely drive Nokia’s growth. Their median price target on Nokia stock is $5.27. The shares’ forward price-earnings and price-sales ratios stand at 12.94 and 0.89, respectively. More value investors may begin to buy the shares.

The Bottom Line on Nokia Stock

In recent quarters, Nokia’s management has put more emphasis on getting 5G contracts. Its recent 5G wins have shown that those efforts are beginning to pay off.

I believe that Nokia stock price will likely go over $5 in the coming weeks, and it could possibly go even higher than that. Therefore, long-term investors should consider buying it around its current levels. Meanwhile, the company could even become a takeover target.

Alternatively, those investors who are interested in 5G names but do not want to buy the stock may consider purchasing the shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that owns the company. Examples of such funds include the Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSE:FIVG), the First Trust IndXX NextG ETF (NASDAQ:NXTG), and the Defiance Quantum ETF (NYSE:QTUM).

264,2020-10-23T12:00:00+00:00,US economy needs ‘fundamental changes’ to expand opportunity: Nicholas Kristof,"New York Times columnist and 'Tightrope"" author, Nicholas Kristof, joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss the health if the U.S. economy.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: We talked about wealth and income inequality that's part of ""Tightrope."" But that the rich and the super rich in the Silicon Valley and the billionaires, particularly during COVID, inadvertently, getting even wealthier than they were before. How can we address this, or should we?

NICHOLAS KRISTOF: I think we should address inequality. And, you know, but maybe inequality is the wrong framework. You know, inequality is a word that tends to get liberals focused, but it tends to turn off conservatives. Opportunity is a word that everybody unites around.

I think I saw a poll that 97% of Americans agree there should be more opportunity for America's kids. And 97% of Americans don't agree that the world is round. That's a huge consensus. And so, you know, I think the fact that you can predict a child's outcome based on a zip code in which they are born should be a scandal.

The fact that in, at least, three American counties, life expectancy is shorter than in Cambodia or Bangladesh. That's-- you know, that's not because those kids are showing a lack of personal responsibility. It's because we as a country are showing a lack of personal responsibility.

And one of the things-- one of the reasons we wrote ""Tightrope"" into this documentary is really an attempt to highlight the need for fundamental changes to provide greater opportunity for kids in ways that not only help those kids, but also restore a better future for the country as a whole.

ANDY SERWER: You know, I love the zip code work that you do. And I saw that you did it in that tax cheat story comparing this woman in prison to President Trump. And then that audit by zip code thing where the most audited zip codes are these impoverished county, the one in the number one in Mississippi with a high-- a level of African-American residents, right?

Story continues

NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Yeah, that's right. That's Humphrey's County, Mississippi and has the highest rate of tax audits in the country. And it's a majority African-American county with I think a per capita income of $28,000 or something. And the idea that that is where the IRS is focusing its resources. And, meanwhile, if I remember right, only 0.8% of 2018 tax filings of more than $10 million have been audited.

You know, there-- there is something wrong with this picture. And it reflects an inequality not only of wealth and income, but an inequality of opportunity and inequality of political power and of a kind of human rights. So I think we need to look at these sort of basic issues of fairness of who we are. And these are complicated. They're hard. They're no easy policies. But other countries, Canada manages to largely figure these out. So does Germany. So does Japan. You know, I think we-- we can do better than we are.

ANDY SERWER: Another hot button topic right now, Nick, is stimulus and what Washington should do to get our economy back on track. Do these checks to Americans work? What's the best way for the government to help us out during the pandemic, you think?

NICHOLAS KRISTOF: The fact that we can't manage a new stimulus package when, 10% of American households with children now say they don't have enough food in the last week is just unconscionable. And I-- I worry that if it doesn't happen before the election that it won't happen before January either.

We also have troubling indications that suicide is up, that use of-- of drugs is up. One person in ""Tightrope"" who runs a drug treatment program, she estimated to me that-- that relapses are up 50% because of the pandemic. And so what we have is a pandemic of disease that is now followed by a pandemic of hunger of school dropouts, of mental health crises, of drug dependency and of suicide.

And there-- you know, there are no easy ways to address it. But we do know that that early effort in the spring to send checks to homes did seem to make a huge difference. And it also, as best economists can tell, did not seem to impede people returning to jobs. So I would very much like to see a new stimulus package aimed at sending out-- sending out checks.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-economy-needs-fundamental-changes-120000425.html?.tsrc=rss,"['AMZN.US', 'FB.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSFT.US', 'QQQ.US', 'SNAP.US', 'SPXL.US', 'SPXS.US', 'SPXU.US', 'TQQQ.US', 'TSLA.US', 'UVXY.US', 'VZ.US', 'ZM.US']","['ANDY SERWER', 'INCOME INEQUALITY', 'NICHOLAS KRISTOF']","{'polarity': 0.984, 'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.113}"
265,2020-10-20T13:00:00+00:00,Retool Nears $1 Billion Valuation With Funding From Sequoia,"(Bloomberg) -- Retool, Inc., a startup that’s less than four years old, is worth almost $1 billion after raising money from some of Silicon Valley’s top investors including Sequoia Capital and executives from GitHub Inc. and Stripe Inc.

The San Francisco-based company recently completed a $50 million financing that was led by Sequoia and values Retool at $925 million. That follows an earlier $25 million round. Other backers include GitHub Chief Executive Officer Nat Friedman, Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Brex Inc. founders Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, and Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham.

Retool is riding a wave of interest in products that make it easier for developers to build applications and other software. The value of this part of the tech industry was highlighted in 2018 when GitHub, which helps developers share code and collaborate, was bought by Microsoft Corp. for $7.5 billion.

While GitHub caters to mostly expert software developers, there’s huge demand for this type of support among less tech-savvy workers. That’s led to an explosion of low-code offerings that don’t require as much knowhow and no-code services, which need no prior coding knowledge.

Retool is taking a low-code approach and the startup focuses on companies that need to build their own internal software tools. Instead of writing software from scratch, these customers can drag and drop Retool’s pre-made building blocks into place, and then use their own code to tweak or customize the final product.

David Hsu, a 25 year-old software engineer, founded Retool in 2017 after realizing how much time he wasted building internal applications in a similar way over and over again. “Lots of engineers fundamentally don’t want to do that,” he said.

The first few lines of code for Retool were written in March 2017. That summer, Retool presented at Y Combinator’s Demo Day, an almost sacred Silicon Valley ritual that showcases promising young startups twice a year. A $1 million seed round followed, and soon after the first customers started using Retool.

Story continues

The company says its service helps developers build applications up to 40 times faster while retaining the flexibility of writing their own code. Customers include Amazon.com Inc., Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Progressive Corp., Peloton Interactive Inc. and Rakuten Inc.

Bryan Schreier, partner at Sequoia, said he was drawn to Retool based on his experience at Google. Schreier oversaw a team building internal tools and he said most of his colleagues were “desperate to do just about anything else.”

Schreier, a Retool board member, also noted that Hsu insisted on keeping Retool’s valuation below $1 billion. That milestone gains startups the coveted “unicorn” status, but the phenomenon has sometimes caused young companies to expand too quickly with disastrous results.

“There is a tendency to glorify a billion-dollar valuation,” Hsu said. “We want to signal that to people that we are just getting started.”

That summer, Retool presented at Y Combinator’s Demo Day, an almost sacred Silicon Valley ritual that showcases promising young startups twice a year. A $1 million seed round followed, and soon after the first customers started using Retool.

The company says its service helps developers build applications up to 40 times faster while retaining the flexibility of writing their own code. Customers include Amazon.com Inc., Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Progressive Corp., Peloton Interactive Inc. and Rakuten Inc.

Bryan Schreier, partner at Sequoia, said he was drawn to Retool based on his experience at Google. Schreier oversaw a team building internal tools and he said most of his colleagues were “desperate to do just about anything else.”

Schreier, a Retool board member, also noted that Hsu insisted on keeping Retool’s valuation below $1 billion. That milestone gains startups the coveted “unicorn” status, but the phenomenon has sometimes caused young companies to expand too quickly with disastrous results.

“There is a tendency to glorify a billion-dollar valuation,” Hsu said. “We want to signal that to people that we are just getting started.”

267,2020-10-20T00:36:10+00:00,SoftBank Amasses Over $20 Billion in Public Stock Unit,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. charged ahead with its new public stock trading arm, increasing equity positions to more than $20 billion despite an initially skeptical response from shareholders, according to a person familiar with the investments.

Bloomberg reported in August that SoftBank had been targeting more than $10 billion and that the sum could reach into the tens of billions. The Japanese conglomerate considered tempering its trading plans in early September after reports that SoftBank’s spending spree was stirring froth in tech stocks. The news erased about $9 billion in market value for SoftBank at the time.

Over the past few weeks, SoftBank renewed its commitment to the public equities trading arm, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The strategy is currently built around expectations of a volatile third-quarter earnings season, the people said. SoftBank has been buying out-of-the-money call options, which deliver returns when share prices rise, and selling calls at even higher prices, one of the people said. Call spreads, as they’re known, cap gains but reduce the initial cost.

A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment. Shares fell about 1.5% in Tokyo trading after hitting a new 20-year high on Monday.

Earnings season is proving to be especially unpredictable. On Oct. 12, the Nasdaq 100 index underwent the biggest rally since April, and options-derived measures of volatility also rose.

An unidentified trader recently purchased around $200 million worth of call contracts on tech stocks in a single day. Call open interest in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. has averaged 12.9 million contracts over the 30 days through Monday, the highest since early 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank founder who’s leading the effort to create the equities arm inside his company, has been reluctant to provide many details about his trading strategy. The company has talked more about a broader strategy of selling assets, paring debt and buying back shares that has been well-received by investors. The stock rose to a 20-year high Monday, the highest level since March 2000 in the midst of the dot-com boom.

Story continues

In August, SoftBank disclosed holdings of $3.9 billion in stocks such as Amazon, which reports financial results on Oct. 29, and Netflix, which reports Tuesday. It has bought a lot more stock since then. While focusing on major tech stocks, SoftBank has also been expanding to smaller companies. Last week, it invested $215 million in Norway-based Kahoot, which makes education software.

268,2020-10-15T18:01:36+00:00,Tech firms are planning to dump office space: study,"More tech firms will shed office space during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some 82% of tech firms anticipate needing less office space in the next 12-18 months, and 55% say they plan to actually get rid of at least some office space in that time period, according to a new survey of 250 U.S. tech companies by Savills, a London-based real estate services provider.

“Some companies are looking to dispose of or sublease space to save on costs,” said Peyton Johnson, senior director at Savills North America. “But some respondents are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach. If they have leases coming up, they may have decided, ‘Let’s not renew, and we can re-evaluate our next move as things become more certain.’” Tech companies' real estate needs, by Savills.

Some 94% of respondents said remote work will be normalized in their organization after the pandemic, and 76% expect a portion of jobs to stay remote full-time in a post-vaccine environment, according to the study.

“Tech will be one of the first industries to adapt to remote work. They might keep just some meeting space, dedicated to collaboration and hospitality, with a few dedicated seats,” said Michael Mathias, executive managing director, New York at Savills. “The tech industry is most sensitive to curating an atmosphere for employees that’s somewhere they want to be because they want to be competitive with recruitment and retention.” Microsoft Offices, Mountain View, Ca.

In fact, Microsoft announced last week that it would allow employees to work half their weekly hours from home, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai envisions a flexible, hybrid remote and in-person model for Google employees according to reports last month. Earlier this summer, Facebook, Twitter, Square, Shopify, Slack and other tech companies also announced semi-permanent work-from-home strategies.

“Microsoft is a behemoth of a company. Once a company like Microsoft, which has been around for so many years, goes to remote work, that’s a strong indicator of what’s to come from other companies,” said Adam Segal, founder and CEO of Cove, a workplace real estate software company.

In San Francisco, home to the Silicon Valley, Big Tech’s shift to remote work left a stark void: More than 3 million square feet of sublease inventory was available in August, up from about 300,000 square feet in March, according to Nima Wedlake, principal at Thomvest Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund.

But for remaining office space, companies won’t simply scale down the sea of desks that once dominated offices, instead they will design them to optimize collaboration and hospitality, according to experts.

“This is an opportunistic time to reimagine and position offices as a key business resource — not a desk to go to every day, but to play to offices’ strength: in-person interactions, engagement and culture,” said Segal, who said offices should layer in technology to coordinate food orders, organize fitness classes and become an experiential business resource.

Thanks to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud computing service and Mixed Reality technologies, upon which Hevolus’ Augmented Store at Home platform is based, the brand will enable shoppers to customize the Tramezza men’s shoe collection through a digital experience offered online and in-store via a dedicated platform launching Oct. 15.

Banking on AR and three-dimensional reproductions of the models, shoppers will be able to choose among four Tramezza styles, nine colors and five materials — ranging from suede to crocodile leather — as well as picking the color of the sole and buckle details.

Through the platform, the interactive shopping sessions could also be shared with the brand’s in-store client advisers, who will be able to access users’ virtual room via Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 holographic headset device to visualize the selections made by customers and support them remotely during the personalization process and the order management.

Salvatore Ferragamo’s chief executive officer Micaela Le Divelec Lemmi touted the “highly immersive and personalized experiences” available through this project. She said the initiative is part of the company’s digital transformation, which “is already offering significant benefits in various areas: from the optimization of the customer journey in an omnichannel perspective to better management of space in physical stores, from the simplification of purchasing methods to better customer service, up to a rise in conversion rates.”

The executive added that the phy-gital service also will be promoted in the coming months through in-store events hosted in 24 cities, including Milan, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Mexico City and São Paulo.

“Salvatore Ferragamo’s experience confirms the increasingly central role of new technologies also in the luxury market and in particular in the fashion market, a sector that sees in tradition and craftsmanship a source of pride,” said Silvia Candiani, Microsoft Italy’s ceo.

“The power of cloud computing and technologies for mixed reality, such as the HoloLens 2 headset, represent an extraordinary enabler to create increasingly engaging and customer experiences that build customer loyalty,” continued Candiani, underscoring that digital tools “will play a crucial role in the global growth of companies” in the coming years.

This is only the latest initiative Salvatore Ferragamo implemented to step up its digital game. Since her appointment to the ceo post in summer 2018, Le Divelec Lemmi has led the company’s increased drive into technology and social media, setting up a digital innovation team in the second half of 2019 to develop the brand’s e-commerce and other initiatives.

As reported, just as COVID-19 began hitting Italy in February, and in order to limit the potential impact of Chinese buyers not being able to travel to Milan and Florence, Ferragamo developed a business solution with digital content company Hyphen creating a digital virtual showroom for the brand.

In spring the company unveiled its new web site blending past history, current activities and a wide assortment of products via a new design and a more effective, intuitive user experience, while in July the brand participated in the Milan Digital Fashion Week with a digital presentation. The same month, the group introduced the Augmented Store 360, a virtual tour of its boutiques, compatible with AR devices, and which allows consumers to buy online and visit the Ferragamo Museum in Florence, including an interactive tour led by personal guides.

More recently, ahead of the unveiling of the documentary on the life of Salvatore Ferragamo directed by Luca Guadagnino during the Venice Film Festival last month, the brand also launched a podcast series further celebrating its founder. For the occasion, 21 international personalities — including actors Stanley Tucci, Jessica Alba, Michelle Monaghan, Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Isabella Rossellini — were invited to read chapters of Ferragamo’s autobiography, which the late founder dictated in the late Fifties and was transcribed into a book titled “Shoemaker of Dreams.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salvatore-ferragamo-teams-microsoft-phy-043046688.html?.tsrc=rss,"['MSFT.US', 'SFRGY.US']","['CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE', 'MICROSOFT', 'MIXED REALITY', 'SALVATORE FERRAGAMO']","{'polarity': 0.995, 'neg': 0.002, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.091}"

272,2020-10-12T21:00:00+00:00,China’s Quiet Experiment Let Millions View Long-Banned Websites,"(Bloomberg) -- In a quiet experiment of just two weeks, China provided millions of people access to long-forbidden foreign websites like YouTube and Instagram. The trial appears to signal the Communist government is moving toward giving the country’s citizens greater access to the global internet -- while still attempting to control who sees what.

The Tuber browser-app, backed by government-linked 360 Security Technology Inc., appeared without fanfare late September and offered for the first time in years a way to view long-banned websites from Facebook Inc. to Google and the New York Times, albeit sanitized versions. Chinese users rejoiced in a newfound ability to directly peruse long-blocked content from a mobile browser without an illegal virtual private network or VPN.

The browser, carried on app stores run by Huawei Technologies Co. among others, suggests Beijing is testing ways to let its 904 million internet users into once-prohibited zones. While Tuber bore the hallmarks of state-style censorship and got pulled without explanation Saturday, it’s Beijing’s most significant experiment in years with greater internet freedoms.

State-sanctioned apps like Tuber offer a possible compromise -- a controlled environment in which activity can be tracked and content screened, while allowing academics, corporations and citizens to exchange information. It addresses a complaint among corporations local and foreign that need to access everything from financial data to critical software tools from abroad.

“This latest development with Tuber is interesting because it could be seen as more openness,” said Fergus Ryan, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “But the way that it would actually work would mean that people who use it would be highly surveilled and the information that they are able to access via this platform is filtered by the censorship apparatus.”

Call it Censorship 2.0. Beijing is increasingly confident of support at home after successfully quashing Covid-19. That -- and the urgent need to increase the quality of its scientific and technological research -- could explain why it’s growing more comfortable with the idea of giving broader access to the internet for at least some of its citizens.

Yet it also realizes it faces growing hostility overseas. Beijing, seeking to better police its citizens, still requires companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. to censor and scrub content critical of the government or its policies. It tried for years with mixed success to abolish the hundreds of VPNs commonly employed to bypass the Great Firewall. Endorsing a state-sanctioned window to the internet could curtail their usefulness.

That could have implications for the likes of Facebook and Microsoft Corp. to Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc., who now either comply with censorship to reach China’s users or remain on the sidelines. Google explored -- but shelved under internal pressure -- a project to create a filtered version of its app for the country. Facebook flirted with the idea of a Chinese service but ultimately torpedoed that too.

Tuber -- downloaded five million times from Huawei’s app store since at least late September -- attracted such an initial frenzy in part because of the pedigree of its largest backer. Its developer is controlled by billionaire and tech mogul Zhou Hongyi, who delisted his security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. from New York in 2016 and aligned himself with national interests.

It’s unlikely that Qihoo developed and distributed the app without Beijing’s blessing. It has reportedly worked on projects for the Chinese military and advises Beijing on sensitive cybersecurity issues. The U.S. Department of Commerce in May sanctioned two of Zhou’s companies among 24 entities it said posed national security concerns.

It’s unclear whether any government agency ordered Tuber’s removal. A public relations employee at 360 Security declined to comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet, hasn’t responded to calls and emails from Bloomberg News since Saturday.

Tuber appeared to censor some content, including on YouTube. A search of President Xi Jinping’s name in Chinese yielded only seven video clips uploaded by three accounts claiming to be television stations in Shanghai, Tianjin and Macau. Searching for Xi’s name in English yielded no results at all.

It required mobile number registration, giving developers the ability to track activity because all smartphone numbers in the country are linked to unique Chinese identification. And, like many commercial apps, it asked for permission to access users’ contacts.

“China has to be really cautious to carefully balance opening a little bit more” with maintaining domestic social order, said Yik Chan Chin, who researches media and communications policy at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou. “It’s very important to release the information flow and let the Chinese people have more interaction with the outside world and also to understand the world better.”

Loosening controls over China’s internet could play a vital role in advancing domestic innovations, said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think-tank Center for China and Globalization. Its leaders will eventually open up cyberspace -- to an extent, he said. Tuber, including its official website, remained blocked as of Monday.

“The fact that news about this particular app spread so quickly in China and generated so much excitement was testament to the pent-up appetite for access to the wider global internet in China,” Ryan said.

It required mobile number registration, giving developers the ability to track activity because all smartphone numbers in the country are linked to unique Chinese identification. And, like many commercial apps, it asked for permission to access users’ contacts.

“China has to be really cautious to carefully balance opening a little bit more” with maintaining domestic social order, said Yik Chan Chin, who researches media and communications policy at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou. “It’s very important to release the information flow and let the Chinese people have more interaction with the outside world and also to understand the world better.”

Loosening controls over China’s internet could play a vital role in advancing domestic innovations, said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think-tank Center for China and Globalization. Its leaders will eventually open up cyberspace -- to an extent, he said. Tuber, including its official website, remained blocked as of Monday.

“The fact that news about this particular app spread so quickly in China and generated so much excitement was testament to the pent-up appetite for access to the wider global internet in China,” Ryan said.

274,2020-10-09T14:32:00+00:00,10 Best ETFs for 2020: The Battle At the Top Tightens,"This year has been a crazy one for investors seeking the best ETFs to buy.

First, the novel coronavirus took a heavy toll on countless stocks. Then we saw a nice recovery in the companies that stood to benefit most from changes in the “new normal.” Meanwhile, industries like air travel and entertainment experienced (and continue to experience) great pain. All of this managed to throw countless exchange-traded funds into limbo, as their general design to hold numerous stocks centralized around a specific theme made some of them particularly vulnerable.

But the madness didn’t stop there.

More recently, tech stocks took a beating shortly before the first debate leading into the Presidential election. Then President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19.

Now, with the election quickly approaching, we’re still trapped in a period of uncertainty. Will Biden win? Or will Trump stay in charge? Either victory could boost some stocks and ETFs, and tank others. Oh, and don’t forget, an asteroid might hit Earth before we even get to that Nov. 3 election date.

While that last bit is somewhat of a joke, it reflects the overall essence of 2020 quite nicely. Just when you expect that things couldn’t get any more crazy this year, they seemingly always do.

But, thankfully, InvestorPlace.com’s best ETFs for 2020 contest has plenty of winners that should hold strong no matter what happens. It also has a few losers too.

The 7 Best New Stocks From 2020 to Buy Now

With all of that said, let’s take a look at how each of these funds has performed (in ascending order from best to worst) through the end of September:

Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO) Global X Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:CLOU) SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:XITK) Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) The Communication Services SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLC) AdvisorShares Vice ETF (NASDAQ:ACT) iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWO) Consumer Staples Select Sector Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP) The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ) U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS)

There’s not much time left in the year, but a few of these ETFs still might manage to run higher.

Best ETFs for 2020: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) Best ETFs for 2020: Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO)

Investor:Tom Taulli
Expense Ratio: 0.6%, or $60 annually per $10,000 invested
Performance Through Q3: 58%

In the end, there can be only one winner of the best ETFs contest. It looks like Tom Taulli’s pick, the IPO ETF, will be the one.

While that might sound like a dramatic reference to the cult-classic film Highlander (“there can be only one!”), it seems fairly accurate. Its current performance (78% year to date) is already significantly greater than the 58% YTD figure recorded at the end of September. At its current level, it has performed nearly 20% greater than CLOU, the No. 2 ETF in the contest.

As impressive as that may be, and with its victory seemingly secure, does it have any more room to run?

The coronavirus helped power IPO at the start of the year as social distancing initiatives led to the breakout success of Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), one of its top holdings. But with clearer expectations developing for the “new normal” ahead, are continued gains guaranteed?

Taulli thinks IPO has what it takes to continue its placement among the best ETFs in the years ahead. While he acknowledges that the IPO market is getting a bit “frothy,” he thinks the trend will continue for some time. According to Taulli, the ETF is a strong way to play the current popularity of IPOs: “when it comes to investing in IPOs, it’s a good idea to have diversification — this is what the IPO fund provides”

Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) Best ETFs for 2020: Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU)

Investor:Dana Blankenhorn
Expense Ratio: 0.68%
Performance Through Q3: 47%

The overall success of cloud stocks (what the CLOU ETF specializes in) this year is undeniable. Again, the pandemic amplified much of that success, but cloud computing is a future-looking theme that was bound for significant relevance and gains without the virus catalyst factored in.

But even the titans must fall from time-to-time. According to Dana Blankenhorn, while the CLOU ETF has been a winner this year, its performance more recently has been ugly. Even so, the ETF is in the No. 2 spot of the contest, and there’s plenty of reason to think it will endure in the months and years ahead:

The companies in CLOU, and those that might be added, are in good position to build the Machine Internet. Anything whose condition can be sensed, calculated, and adjusted will become a networked computer over the next decade. More internet demand will come from machines than from people using them.

10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy From Some of America's Best ETFs

That’s as good of a long-term catalyst as any. Just don’t expect CLOU to edge out IPO as the winner for best ETFs. But in the big picture, as a longer-term investment, Blankenhorn remains positive on the ETF’s outlook.

SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (XITK) Best ETFs for 2020: SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (XITK)

Investor:Bret Kenwell
Expense Ratio: 0.45%
Performance Through Q3: 43%

As its namesake suggests, the XITK ETF focuses on companies involved in innovative technologies. And, as you’re likely realizing by now, the new virus has helped propel many innovative companies since their technologies were adopted much more quickly than expected.

Its holdings include the aforementioned Zoom Communications and other “coronavirus stocks” like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). Although the virus boost will fade in time, most of its holdings should retain their relevance in the years ahead. This is largely what makes Bret Kenwell think that it will remain one of the best ETFs heading into the new normal. He also notes the fund’s diversity as a positive aspect that sets it apart from other growth-based ETFs:

Diversification can be a negative in some cases. In the case of the XITK ETF though, it helps remove any single-stock risk. That’s a benefit in my mind. That’s because growth stocks are likely to rally or fall together, but any one stock could really ruin the fund’s performance if it had too large of a weighting.

According to Kenwell, if growth stocks continue to rise, then the XITK ETF will also run higher. If he’s right, this might be the dark horse of the race. Watch out, IPO!

Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) Best ETFs for 2020: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)

Investor:Readers’ Choice
Expense Ratio: 0.2%
Performance Through Q3: 27%

Our reader’s choice for the contest, QQQ, is always a solid bet. In fact, it won the best ETFs contest in a prior year. It continues to demonstrate its viability as an investment, currently ranked No. 4 in the contest.

Part of what makes it attractive is that its holdings include the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq. While it’s not explicitly a tech stock ETF, it holds behemoths like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a part of its top holdings.

Usually this is a great thing — and for much of the pandemic it has been a winner. But, more recently, tech stocks took a dive and QQQ has started to stutter. I wouldn’t expect QQQ to surpass the likes of IPO, CLOU or the XITK ETF this year, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not one of the best ETFs out there today.

If you have a positive outlook on the world of tech and an economic recovery in general, then there’s no reason to lose faith despite the recent dip.

The Communication Services ETF (XLC) Best ETFs for 2020: The Communication Services ETF (XLC)

Investor:Todd Shriber
Expense Ratio: 0.13%
Performance Through Q3: 10%

A winning theme this year (as with most years in recent times) has been tech. But many of the companies in the newly formed Communication Services sector are also intertwined with these tech-based themes. As such, Todd Shriber’s pick, XLC, has managed to chart a 10% rise this year. That success comes despite all the challenges induced by the pandemic.

The gains for XLC might not be as monstrous as the top three picks in the contest, but there’s still immense promise for its holdings in the years ahead. Holdings like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) aren’t going to disappear anytime soon. And video game plays Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision-Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) have only gotten better as more people cling to video games for entertainment rather than bars and in-person socialization.

Shriber thinks the holiday season could bolster its videogame holdings and companies like Facebook and Alphabet will overcome political challenges, all of which could help it climb a little higher by the end of 2020.

AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) Best ETFs for 2020: AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT)

Investor:InvestorPlace Staff
Expense Ratio: 0.99%
Performance Through Q3: 4%

The InvestorPlace Staff never assumed that the ACT ETF would win the contest, but they did see reason for optimism beyond a victory.

As one of the few ETFs that focus on sin stocks, ACT holds marijuana, booze and tobacco companies. While tobacco and marijuana stocks haven’t been hot players this year, some booze stocks have managed to climb higher. In particular, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) has marked impressive gains this year on the popularity of its new seltzer booze brand “Truly Hard Seltzer.” This has helped keep ACT afloat while much of its marijuana holdings continue to suffer.

7 Sin Stocks to Buy Today For Tempting Dividends

ACT won’t win this year’s contest. But the success of booze amid the coronavirus pandemic and the outcome of the election might ultimately power it a little higher this year and further in the future. It’s certainly worth keeping an eye on if you’re interested in sin stocks.

iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) Best ETFs for 2020: iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)

Investor:Ian Bezek
Expense Ratio: 0.24%
Performance Through Q3: 2%

Although Ian Bezek’s pick for this year’s best ETFs contest had a rough start in 2020, he still has faith in its comeback. Citing what he calls the “small-cap advantage,” Bezek argues that small-cap stocks generally out-perform large-cap stocks, and while the fund’s smaller holdings have suffered, when the economy recovers, they will soar again.

As Bezek notes, just looking at its YTD performance alone is a little deceiving. Given the selloff in March, the ETF has already climbed more than 70% higher back from its lows. And he thinks that once economic conditions start to normalize, we might expect IWO to rise even higher.

It’s all a matter of perspective:

In owning the IWO ETF, you get exposure to some of the most innovative companies in the country. And at only 5% more expensive than last year, IWO is still a reasonably priced way to get that exposure. It certainly beats chasing many of the software or e-commerce stocks that have already doubled or tripled this year.

If you think that argument by Bezek holds muster, then you might consider IWO a great play from a longer-term view.

Investor:Kent Thune
Expense Ratio: 0.13%
Performance Through Q3: 2%

Playing it safe usually isn’t very exciting, but sometimes it can also prove beneficial in an economic downturn.

As mentioned earlier, 2020 has been a crazy year so far. And the upcoming U.S. presidential election aims to make it even crazier. That’s part of the appeal of a fund like XLP — it offers stability.

After all, even in desperate times, consumers will always purchase “essential” items. That has always been the appeal to consumer staples stocks, the investment theme XLP focuses on. And it’s largely why Thune picked it for the contest.

But, while Thune thinks it’s still a wise choice, he also points out another lesson he’s learned in the process. Old investment theses don’t necessarily apply to the new normal. Instead, he sees “tech as the new defensive play:”

While it may be foolish to say those four most dangerous words, ‘this time it’s different,’ it’s also foolish to assume that the same defensive strategies will work ad infinitum … 2020 was certainly not a normal year, but it does provide a glimpse into what the future holds for capital markets. And investors are wise to take note.

The 10 Top Stocks to Buy For Q4

In summary, the head honchos in tech also demonstrate significant resilience. Maybe it’s time to stop looking at XLP as the only go-to defensive ETF on the market?

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) Best ETFs for 2020: The Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ)

Investor:Tim Biggam
Expense Ratio: 0.75%
Performance Through Q3: -43%

As seen with the ACT ETF earlier, this hasn’t been a strong year for marijuana stocks. But while ACT managed to stay in the green this year, bolstered by its holdings in the booze industry, the MJ ETF ended up tanking.

Given that it’s only focused on cannabis-based stocks, this should be no surprise. According to Biggam, the market for CBD and other products is oversaturated and investors lost faith in some of the hype machines that stormed higher in 2019. But as glum as that may be, he also thinks this is a great opportunity.

Biggam sees the MJ ETF making a comeback towards the end of this year and into 2021. He thinks the release of new cannabis-based beverages and further developments in legalization efforts in the U.S. will prove strong catalysts moving forward. As such, he sees now as a good opportunity to get into MJ as a fund with a high-dividend yield at a cheap price.

U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) Best ETFs for 2020: U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)

Investor:Vince Martin
Expense Ratio: 0.6%
Performance Through Q3: -45%

Out of all the picks in this contest, JETS has consistently performed the worst. As a fund with holdings based solely in the airline industry, it has done about as well as you might expect during a global pandemic. But according to Vince Martin — the one who picked it — the impact of the pandemic managed to highlight some of the other issues influencing the industry.

Martin says while it’s tempting to hop on JETS now and hope for a recovery in the long term, there’s reason this investment thesis falls apart: “In practice … cyclical stocks usually aren’t cheap enough at the top. With economic damage from the pandemic likely to linger, it’s going to take years simply for investors to get comfortable with the macroeconomic risk in the sector.”

When you combine this reality with the fact that the industry was poorly prepared for a potential threat that it had already anticipated (a pandemic), it’s clear why Martin is less optimistic about JETS as a comeback ETF for 2021. Only time will tell if the industry can regain its former strength. But for now, Martin suggests waiting on the sidelines.

Video Transcript

ANDY SERWER: A man of many hats, Kurt Andersen is a radio host, an entrepreneur, a television producer, and a novelist. But before becoming a wizard of all things, he started out as a journalist. After graduating from Harvard, Andersen co-founded ""Spy,"" a satirical magazine which mocked American celebrities and media icons in the late 1980s and 1990s, including now President Trump.

From there, Kurt worked as an editor in chief of ""New York Magazine,"" then moved to ""The New York Times,"" and later created his own radio show. These days, he describes himself as a book writer. But Andersen says he's always had more than one plate spinning at a time. In this episode of ""Influencers,"" I speak with Kurt Andersen about his newest book, his infamous nickname for President Donald Trump, and how America's middle class is at war with the ultra rich.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, everyone, and welcome to ""Influencers."" I'm Andy Serwer, and welcome to our guest Kurt Andersen, who is a journalist, radio host, and author of a number of books, including the new ""Evil Geniuses, The Unmaking of America."" Kurt, great to see you.

KURT ANDERSEN: Good to see you, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So I want to ask you, first of all, about that introduction. And this is an unusual question. But is that how you would describe yourself? I mean, what do you do for a living, Kurt?

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, I do fewer things lately. I stopped doing the radio show a few months ago. I would say I write books. I mean, I'm also working on another podcast. I'm also working on a TV show. I tend to have more than one plate spinning at a time, but pretty much I'm a book writer.

ANDY SERWER: Right. So let's talk about ""Evil Geniuses"" a little bit. The book describes the rise of wealth inequality and political influence of wealthy interest in the United States since the '60s and '70s. Why did you decide to write about this?

Story continues

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, it sort of found me, as writers say, but it did. I wrote a-- I've been writing novels for 20 years, and then I wrote a nonfiction book that came out three years ago called ""Fantasyland."" There was another history of America and how in my view we screwed ourselves up. And that was about the what I call the sort of part of the American character that has always been there, which is the kind of weakness for believing the untrue if it's exciting enough to believe and that it finally got out of hand the last few decades and especially the last four years.

And so I realized after that after I finished that book that that was really only half the story. That was a purely cultural story, really, and that there was this other set of things that had happened in the last 50 years. So I realized there was a kind of sequel to write that was more yes. ""Evil Geniuses"" is also about cultural changes and how I tie that into the rest of what I talk about. But mostly, the book is about economics, as you say, and politics and technology.

And so, really, there was one-- there were several times when I was talking about ""Evil Geniuses"" or, rather, when I've talked about ""Fantasyland."" And people in audiences would say, well, yeah, OK, Americans don't believe in climate change. But isn't that just because the Koch brothers made them not believe in climate change by spending all this money on politics?

And I would say yes, sure, that's part of it. But there is this predisposition among Americans, unlike people in most developed countries, to believe things that aren't true. And but then I realized that it is the combination in that instance. It is the combination of credulity of Americans along with this very deliberate strategic work over decades to make them in the particular case of climate change, not believe that it's a real thing or a thing to worry about.

So then I realized I'd been around. I was a, you know, young adult in the 1980s as even the '70s, I was a young adult. And so I was there when-- what I what this book is about happened. But I realized I wasn't paying very close attention even though I was also a journalist.

I wasn't really paying attention partly because I was doing well as this cabal, if you will, of evil geniuses was twisting and changing and transforming our whole economic system through the '70s and '80s and '90s. I was doing fine. And, therefore, my-- my kind of I suppose my acuity had seen all that was happening was blunted by the fact that it was working out pretty well for me.

ANDY SERWER: Right, exactly. And-- and so when you talk about that, there is this role that is played by people in the left in the Democratic Party that it's not just the right. There's a-- I don't know if being complicit is too strong a word. But--

KURT ANDERSEN: I'll take it.

ANDY SERWER: Is it that? Then explain yourself. I mean, so the left is a part of it then.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, certainly, the liberal-- the-- yes, left of center people were definitely a part of it. I mean, the book is primarily about the economic right, the Milton Friedmanites, the Kochs, the other right wing billionaires, the whole right wing counter establishment, economic right wingers, and what they built in the '70s and '80s and '90s to really create a paradigm shift about how all of us and our system thought about fairness and equality and all those things economically.

But we knew Democrats, as they were called starting in the '70s, the Gary Hart's, the Bob Kerrey's, the Bill Bradley's, the Paul Tsongas's-- all these guys who were my heroes, frankly-- said, oh, we're all free marketers now. We're all-- the '60s are over. We're now committed to compromise and figuring out a, you know, a good system that's all about the free market. And let's meet halfway.

Well, and they did. And we-- again, I wasn't a policy maker. We did. And then I just kept moving to the right. And there really ceased to be in this country a politically influential economic left. I mean, really, the-- they were still back in that day. There were still liberal Republicans.

Then the sort of Democrats on economics took over that role of being the liberal Republicans. And there were no FDR's left. There was not that economic vision politically that had any kind of consequence or power or much influence in the United States.

ANDY SERWER: That reminds me of two things quickly. One, I remember a British person explaining to another British person, said, well, you've got the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, which is like the Tory Party here. And you got the Democratic Party. And that's like the Tory Party here. [LAUGHS]

And then another one, I remember just a couple of years ago, Kurt, I'm up in Maine. And someone said to me for the first time. And I was shocked when they said this to me. But it makes so much sense now that the Bush's and the Clinton's-- they're all the same.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, exactly. You know, and I used to-- I remember back in the '90s. I remember the 2000 election when people would say to me, oh, you know, the Democrats, the Republicans-- they're not a lick of difference between them. And, of course, I would say but look, the Supreme Court race, women's rights, reproductive rights, all and on. And those indeed are significant differences between Democrats and Republicans then and now.

But what they were seeing-- and I wasn't-- oh, I wasn't, because, again, the system was not screwing me over was that in economics that they had their heads ceased to be much of a difference. It was really-- it was really a-- you know, people talked in hyperbolic terms that I always looked at as too hyperbolic about, you know, there's a Capitalist Party. There's a leftish half called the Democrats and a rightish half called the Republicans.

Now, and so that's true, even though, of course, the left and certainly my position in this book is like Elizabeth Warren's. I'm all for the free market system, just one that works and is sustainable for the long term and is fair as it was when I was young.

ANDY SERWER: So what do you say, or what do you think about the young person who supported Elizabeth Warren or Bernie and then you have to tell them-- not you-- but the Democrats or Biden has to say vote for me. And they're like, no?

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, not many of them are saying no I think. I hope not. But certainly in the-- during the primary campaign, that was a legit thing to say. And Joe Biden was not my first, second, or maybe even third choice candidate. But what I say to them, I say partly as a result of running ""Evil Geniuses"" and doing this forensic history of how this change and the hijacking happened is it is a long game.

It's not just one candidate and your favorite candidate or I'm leaving. It isn't this election. It's a long, long game that these guys played so brilliantly. And so, yes, you know, yes, you want-- we want radical change. I'll stipulate that young person who votes who was a Bernie Bro. But it comes, I'm afraid, you know, one step at a time. And the first step is would be great wouldn't it, I think, if we had a big landslide electing this moderate Democrat president.

And by the way, a moderate Democrat, who because his party has moved significantly left just in the last decade on economics finally has become a kind of party of the left on economics that he will do what his party wants because he is a kind of generic Democrat. And, therefore, I would say to them-- and I have said to them, including my children-- you know, you get this guy. And you get this administration elected. You hope for the best. You put pressure on him to do what you want to do in terms of child care and health care and higher taxes on the rich and big business and all the rest.

And, you know, this is your shot. I mean, you know-- you know, you couldn't even get Bernie Sanders nominated. So give up that-- give up your sorrow and anger about that and face what's in front of you, which is, you know, creating-- getting a Democratic senate, a Democratic president, and that's your first step. But it's only a first step.

ANDY SERWER: You wrote in your book about the rise of inequality. We were hoodwinked. We hoodwinked ourselves. Are you referring to the media there?

KURT ANDERSEN: No, I'm sure. But I'm really referring to-- to all of us. And certainly the media and the professional class of-- of liberals and even professional Democrats who I think overinterpreted what the election and the huge-- the landslide election of Ronald Reagan meant, I think-- but also just regular Americans who were convinced that, you know, they were voting to make America this beautiful, idyllic small town Bedford Falls kind of place like it is in Maine, like it is here in Connecticut, again, and really didn't read the fine print or didn't imagine what was really going on, which is that they, the normal people, the 80, 75% of Americans who aren't anywhere near the top we're going to get screwed. And they did.

So that's the hoodwinking. The hoodwinking by this-- this-- this kind of turning the nostalgia that had become so rampant in the 1970s and then into the '80s into a political means of selling Reaganism and Americas. It's a beautiful place, and it's morning in America without really going into the details, the hundreds of details of what that meant about how unfair and insecure and unequal all of the important pieces of the American economic system were about to become.

ANDY SERWER: What about someone like Warren Buffett? Or and there are other wealthy people out there who've been saying for years that our taxes-- their taxes should be raised. Taxes being a hot button issue this week. We'll get back to that.

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah. Well, Warren Buffett, whom I've known for a long time because I grew up in Omaha where he still lives, has been amazing and extraordinary. And I don't share some of the loathing of every-- each and every billionaire that some of my political friends and allies share.

He has been extraordinary. And not only has he said that that, oh, I should pay as much taxes as a percentage as my secretary, as he has said many times. He also said, as I talk about in the book, in 2005 and 2006, he said a couple of times in big interviews that got some attention at the time that, yes, there has been a class war. You conservatives are talking about how the left such as it was is fighting a class war.

There's been a class war, and it's my side. It's the rich people, and we're winning. And we shouldn't be. And he said that again and again. And I remember at the time thinking, wow, good for Warren. Yeah, right. But that's just hyperbole, isn't it? And really at that moment is when I began thinking and reading and studying more. And it ended up in this book, you know, ""Geniuses"" but realizing that it wasn't just a poetic notion.

There really was, had been since the 1970s, a kind of class war on the part of the rich to transform the economy. And in every, you know, graph you look at or of the history of how economic growth continue going, productivity kept rising. And, yet, all boats stopped rising together all at once around 1980. And it wasn't by accident.

ANDY SERWER: So I'm glad you mentioned the Omaha connection to Warren Buffett because I was going to ask you about that. So tell us about when you met him or first met him. Are you still in touch with him? I mean, everyone in Omaha almost know each other or something.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, yeah, because it's only a half a million people live in a city. And but my parents were friendly with him and unfortunately not friendly enough to invest money with him. But they were friendly. And I really didn't-- I got to know him a little bit when I was older.

For instance, I wrote him a letter when I and my friend Graydon Carter were starting ""Spy"" magazine in 1986, asking if he wanted to invest in ""Spy"" magazine. And he wrote me back and very nicely declined and saying, no, I don't invest in startups, well, that kind and so forth.

Anyways, then we run into each other over the years. And he's always really nice to me and always says nice things about my mom, my late mother and stuff. And so he's-- you know, he's great. And, again, in terms of a decent rich guy who eh, as you say, he's been-- he's been terrific.

But he also, he in his old school investment strategy of investing in companies for the long haul and letting them run themselves and all that stuff, really, this pre-1980 way of investing in regarding the system, again, that to me is much closer to optimal than the cut and run private equity-driven system and day trading investors without any commitment to anything that we-- that we've developed since.

ANDY SERWER: I had no idea that Warren Buffett might have been an investor in ""Spy"" magazine. I'm still processing that, Kurt. So ""Spy"" magazine, you know, for those people who don't know it, it was this amazing publication that spawned all kinds of careers and started all kinds of trends in journalism. And I was a huge fan.

One maybe the most enduring element was your nickname of the current president of the United States. And so you've been-- and we'll get to it. And you've been covering Donald Trump for decades now because of that. And so talk to us about the nickname that you came up for the president-- how you got it and all that.

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, Donald Trump-- so ""Spy"" magazine was this satirical monthly magazine, started this small New York focused thing in 1986 and very quickly was in its way, very successful very quickly and became a national magazine. We had hundreds of thousands of readers and subscribers.

So as I say, it was a satirical magazine. So we had our targets and our recurring subjects. Donald Trump was in our first issue. The first issue, the cover story, the first issue was ""Jerks: The 10 Most Annoying New Yorkers."" Donald Trump being one of those 10. And, by the way, in the little write up on him in that first issue, he was talking about how he could be president. He could solve the Missile Crisis with the Soviet Union in an hour.

He would-- he didn't need to know anything more than he knows now. So, you know, on past is preface. So we call-- we in [INAUDIBLE] we for our recurrent subjects, whether it was Donald Trump or Henry Kissinger or whomever-- people we talked about regularly-- we created sort of epithets that we repeatedly attached to them once we settle on one only and called them that again and again and again.

Graydon and I had both worked at ""Time Magazine."" We're both working at ""Time Magazine"" at the time. And back in the day before our day. ""Time"" had had such epithets that they always back in the '40s and '50s that they referred to people as. So we thought, oh, that's funny. We'll do this kind of corny old fashioned things.

For instance, Henry Kissinger, we called socialite war criminal Henry Kissinger every time I referred to him. And Donald Trump, we tried various nicknames. And none of them stuck. And, you know, Queens born casino operator Donald Trump-- various kinds. Then we in 1988, we came up with short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump. And we knew we had a winner and kept at it and kept calling him that.

And that was based simply on the fact that Graydon as right before we were starting ""Spy"" had gone to interview Trump for a profile he was writing and came back to our little not even an office at the time, barely an office, and said, you know what. This guy, yeah, he's a big guy. He is 6 feet, almost as tall as I am, he said. But he's got the tiniest little fingers I've ever seen.

So ah, then when-- and, of course, he's a vulgarian. So when the time came to dream up a nickname, short-fingered vulgarian worked, and it stuck. And you say I studied Trump or covered him for years. I did-- certainly it's ""Spy."" But then from 1993 to 2015, not so much.

But then he came back. And then suddenly in a debate in 2015 with Marco Rubio, there they were, two candidates for president, arguing about whether his fingers were long or short and what it meant about his manhood and the rest. And I just felt like I was having an acid flashback at the time.

ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised that he's president?

KURT ANDERSEN: Ah, ha, that's so hard to say, Andy, at this point 4, 3, almost four years into it. Yes, it is. It remains to me a kind of amazing like, stuck in a nightmare, stuck in an acid trip surprise. I'm-- I can't say I wake up every day surprised. But something like some cousin of surprise, yes.

And even though this last book of mine that I mentioned, ""Fantasyland"" of which he became a kind of poster boy, I wrote and finished before he was even nominated. If he hadn't been nominated, if he hadn't run for president, let alone be elected. I probably wouldn't have mentioned him in the book. Maybe I would have. Maybe, but probably not. So I-- so I saw what was happening to the country that made it so right to elect such a preposterous monstrous person.

But that doesn't mean I wasn't still surprised when he was elected, given that, you know, back in 1988 when we thought he was a joke and-- and took national polls asking people if they wanted Donald Trump to run for president, because even back then, he was flirting with that notion. We thought it was just-- it was funny. It was a joke. It was he was a cartoon character, and he was fun to make fun of.

ANDY SERWER: Do you understand, Kurt, that some people watching this might be deeply offended by what you're saying, maybe call you a long-fingered liberal or I don't know what--

KURT ANDERSEN: Yes, they might. And both, all those-- both-- all of those adjectives are correct.

ANDY SERWER: OK, leave that alone. But what is it? I mean, 30%, 40% of America loves this man.

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah, yeah. Well, and 30% or 40%-- I would say 30% love him, and another 10% or 15% will vote for him would be my estimate. Then there are my evil geniuses who don't love him, by and large, who-- who understand that this is the guy they got who there-- who the hoi polloi in their right wing coalition love. And, therefore, they're stuck with him.

And as long as he gives them a $2 trillion tax cut, as he did in his one legislative accomplishment in 2017, and as long as he is a ferocious anti-regulation guy and really serves them in every way, except they don't like tariffs so much but will live with that, they're good by him.

So but what does it mean, the, you know, 30% really do love him? It's, you know, 30% of America believes all kinds of things, are strange and kooky and misguided in all kinds of ways. So, yeah, they managed to elect a president. And that's strange and phenomenal and a milestone. But what are you going to do?

ANDY SERWER: Yeah, I mean, that's how it sort of ties into the book, right? I mean, that it speaks to people believing things. I mean, and maybe people believe Donald Trump, literally every single thing he says, I think that the president himself has said, hey, some of this is hyperbole, right?

KURT ANDERSEN: I don't know that he says that anymore. He said it-- well, rather, Tony Schwartz, his first ghostwriter, said it when he wrote Donald Trump's first memoir back in 1987. I don't-- he says, oh, I was joking. Or he doesn't say, as some people have said about him when he was running, oh, don't take me literally, but just take me seriously. He doesn't quite know the difference or care about the difference. And if he-- you know, he always gives himself the option of saying, oh, no, no, no, I was just joking, if he sometimes goes too far.

But he-- it's-- it is a-- it's just a show, sure, but he's also president of the United States, hurting and ruining many human beings' lives in various ways. So you know, you have to take him literally-- potentially literally-- always and for sure seriously always.

ANDY SERWER: So this notion that Americans historically have believed in things you don't understand, to quote a Stevie Wonder song I guess, right? But it's-- there's-- it's a more dangerous world now, Kurt, because of social media, arguably. And if you look at elements like QAnon, I mean, that's different from 30 years ago, right?

KURT ANDERSEN: It is. I mean, again, in fact, I talk about the kind of-- America's devolution into believing too many conspiracy theories to explain any bad thing that people think is bad started around-- you know, in the late '60s and slowly but surely got worse and worse, especially in the '90s and especially in the '90s and after because, as you say, of not just social media back then but the internet. Once we had an internet and all kinds of preposterous conspiracy theories and preposterous ideas and, quote unquote, ""facts"" of all kinds looked legit. Look, I saw it on the internet. It looks just like ""The New York Times."" It looks real. It must be real. We were in trouble because that was a new condition.

You know, there have always been crackpots. There's always been conspiracy theories. And by the way, as I always stipulate when I talk about conspiracy theories, I understand some conspiracies really exist. However, most conspiracies-- conspiracy theories-- are not true, and many of them are insane, like QAnon.

But once we had the internet, this-- what had become this default fantasy instinct to explain everything in terms of conspiracies-- really got out of control and was-- took over more and more of the brain space, especially on the right-- not just the right because, you know, for things like-- the anti-vaccine movement at the beginning was more left than right. The 9/11 truthers at the beginning were more left than right. But it became more of a thing of the right.

And once you had this ability to conscript believers and then suddenly believers felt like, look, I'm not the only person who believes this, there are thousands tens of thousands, millions of us, it was a cascade out of control. And yeah, eventually, you're going to get to QAnon, where there are god knows how many believers and now Republican candidates for the House of Representatives who are QAnon believers, this utterly preposterous, constantly evolving, kind of collectively authored theory of everything.

That-- again, in many ways, it's not so different than the thing that existed when you and I were children, which is the John Birch Society, but they at least had a focus. It was Soviet Union, China, communism, anticommunism, you know, Dwight Eisenhower was a stooge of the communists and so forth. Now, that was ridiculous, and they were extreme. But not even-- but the conservatives at the time, like William F. Buckley and Barry Goldwater, stigmatized them, kept them over-- away from the party. These were-- we couldn't have these people. That's no longer the case.

And thanks to the internet, you know, you don't have to go to some little storefront in Bogalusa to be a member of the conspiracy believers, as the John Birchers did. You-- they're everywhere, and it's as accessible as your telephone.

ANDY SERWER: You know, you're on Twitter a lot, Kurt.

KURT ANDERSEN: I am. I am, Andy.

ANDY SERWER: So-- right, and so-- I am too much. I really look forward to the day that I'm done with it. And I don't know I can't say that-- like, that the day is today, but that's part of the whole attraction and that's a whole other conversation. Have you given much thought in terms of how Twitter and Facebook, just to name two, could police this stuff, stop it, or what do we need to do to Facebook and Twitter?

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah, it's tough because it is a new situation. But-- and Twitter is making its efforts. You know, Facebook is a different beast because it's so all-encompassing. And so really, it's a monopoly. It is a monopoly, as is Google. So you have the problems of monopoly, which is one set of problems. But then in the case of Facebook, you have a founder and controller or CEO who has made it clear he is unwilling to make any meaningful attempts, really, to figure out how this new, incredibly powerful platform will not be worse for society and humanity than better.

And it seems pretty clear to me that it's a net bad right now. And I'm not saying it's easy. You don't want suddenly a, you know, government censor reading every post on Facebook or whatever. But it's a new thing. You know, as people have said, it's like a magazine or Yahoo Finance or a television network news division in terms of people get their news and information from it. But they forswear any responsibility for what is said or done on it, you know?

So OK, that's a new situation, and I get that it's hard when you're that big and X billions of users and all that. But that doesn't mean we don't have to try to figure out how to do that. And there are technical means. There are all kinds of means. And obviously, they have pursued some of them at Facebook. But their-- his slash their-- Mark Zuckerberg's and their basic corporate instinct seems to be no, we're not going to do that. We're really not going to do that. Let a million flowers bloom even if 643,000 of them are toxic, you know?

ANDY SERWER: Our opium poppies. And by the way, if you see any, give us a call, and we'll probably take those out.

KURT ANDERSEN: There you go. Exactly, exactly.

ANDY SERWER: [INAUDIBLE] Maybe, maybe.

KURT ANDERSEN: Yeah, unless that particular opium plantation is paying us quite a bit of money to grow them.

ANDY SERWER: Right, right. Flipping back to Donald Trump for a quick question, Kurt-- or maybe a long one-- are you surprised that President Trump only paid $750 in taxes in-- two years in a row?

KURT ANDERSEN: Well, I'm surprised that he paid any. I'm surprised at the number, to tell you the truth. I mean, like, I really want the conversation with the accountant or the lawyer or whomever in which they decide, eh, $750. That's-- what?

So am I surprised he paid no taxes? I mean, specifically, no. Because again-- and I was looking back just the last couple of days because of this big ""Times"" article and set of articles at the coverage-- the investigative-- financial investigative journalism that probably did back 29 years ago about him, and it's the same story, right? I mean, it's 29 years earlier, so it's not, obviously, the same story. And there was no ""Apprentice,"" which was really the place he's really made money over the years, but the same money-losing enterprises and using the tax systems' craziness to not have to pay taxes and all of it.

So no, you know, I mean-- and at this point-- and you asked earlier, does it surprise you that Donald Trump is president, yes and no. But nothing about his finances really surprises me. It would surprise me if he were paying-- it surprises me less that he paid $750 a year for two years than it would have if I'd read that he paid $30 million a year for the last few years. That would shock me.

ANDY SERWER: So a final question, Kurt, what are you up to next?

KURT ANDERSEN: Uh--

ANDY SERWER: --or now?

KURT ANDERSEN: I am working on a podcast history of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War, this limited series that I'm into and interested in. I am working on a television project for Disney+ and with Jeff Goldblum. I-- and I'm trying to figure out what my next book is going to be.

ANDY SERWER: It sounds like a pretty full plate to me.

KURT ANDERSEN: It's a good plate. It's a fine plate. It-- it was really good-- it was personally pleasurable for me, for all-- despite all the tragedy and horror of this pandemic, to have had this book ""Evil Geniuses"" come out-- I was-- I finished it literally, like, the day before the pandemic. I finished it in early February.

So I had the last six months, seven months just to, you know, edit it and promote it and come and get to talk to people like you about it. So it's filled my time. It's filled my pandemic pretty nicely.

ANDY SERWER: Good thing. All right, keep spinning those plates.

KURT ANDERSEN: Thanks.

ANDY SERWER: Kurt Andersen, author of the new book ""Evil Geniuses, The Unmaking of America."" Thank you very much.

276,2020-10-07T17:43:20+00:00,Biden Win Could Have Implications For Exciting Tech ETF,"There are myriad potential sector-level outcomes that could result following Election Day. Broadly speaking, it's expected that a victory by former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joe Biden would be beneficial to some already high-flying sectors, including technology.

What Happened

That's relevant for multiple reasons, not the least of which is the fact that technology is the largest sector weight in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. However, there are other implications for exchange traded funds, including the geared Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL).

TECL looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, a benchmark heavy on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).

Why It's Important: Obviously, TECL is a geared ETF, a triple-leveraged one at that, meaning there's substantial risk in holding the fund from now through Election Day. However, electoral outcomes are among the events that increase the allure of leveraged ETFs as short-term trading instruments, meaning TECL could be worth a look immediately following Election Day.

“Joe Biden has vowed to get tough on big tech and tax breaks should he win the U.S. presidential race in November, but analysts and legal experts note current global uncertainties could hinder the Democratic challenger from shaking up Silicon Valley in the near term,” according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

That's good news because some Biden chatter, if it evolved beyond that point, could TECL's bearish cousin, the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS), in play.

“Biden has pledged to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, undoing some of the tax cuts implemented under the Trump administration,” according to S&P Global. “The former vice president also aims to set a minimum tax of 15% on companies' book income, or profits reported to shareholders, and to raise taxes on foreign earnings of U.S. companies located overseas — two policies that directly impact the U.S tech sector.”

Story continues

What's Next

What could make TECL a valid post-election trade is if Congress remains split and more details emerge from Biden, assuming he wins, on his tax plan.

“It is unclear how much Biden's proposed increase will impact tech firms, as the tech sector is notorious for having an effective tax rate that is significantly lower than the statutory rate, or the percentage set by federal law,” notes S&P Global. “Companies report their effective tax rate as a calculated figure that includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes, as well as various tax breaks.”

283,2020-09-29T21:00:09+00:00,Xi Jinping’s Tech Wonderland Runs Into Headwinds,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- At a new 400-acre research-and-development center on China’s south coast, Huawei Technologies Co. engineers chat, tap at their phones, or chill out on a small electric tram that whirs them between buildings modeled variously on the Sorbonne or England’s great universities. They move through neighborhoods built in the style of Versailles or Renaissance Italy, passing by some of the 3,000 gardening and maintenance staff needed to keep the vast parklands immaculate.

It’s late July, and on this Disneyland-like corporate campus about an hour and a half’s drive from Hong Kong, Huawei seems to be basking in the wealth from its leadership in 5G mobile technology. No other company has done more to project the image of a technologically advanced China on the international stage. And no other company stands as a greater symbol of China’s engagement with the outside world.

Huawei’s vaulting ambition to be at the forefront of future-defining technologies has landed the company in the crosshairs of the U.S. and other governments that see it as a conduit for the geopolitical objectives of the Chinese Communist Party. In mid-August the U.S. Department of Commerce, at President Trump’s direction, handed down yet another round of restrictions aimed at cutting Huawei’s access to commercially available computing chips it needs to make 5G base stations and smartphones.

The fortunes of China’s largest technology company by revenue are entwined with a vast project that’s now the front line of the hugely consequential tech war between the U.S. and China: the Greater Bay Area, a region tasked by President Xi Jinping with pushing the nation toward global technology leadership.

The GBA’s ability to innovate and integrate enough to succeed in that task is facing its stiffest challenge yet from a U.S.-led global backlash against Chinese tech and Beijing’s political crackdown in Hong Kong. If the GBA’s companies can surmount the obstacles being placed in their path, they could well determine how advanced and prosperous China can become under Xi.

The Pearl River Delta—long one of China’s richest and most economically dynamic regions and rebranded by Xi as the Greater Bay Area—stretches from the forested hills around Zhaoqing in the northwest to the concrete towers of Hong Kong Island in the southeast. It’s the epicenter of Xi’s strategy to attain high-income status, bind the former colonial centers of Hong Kong and Macao into the motherland, and complete what he calls the “rejuvenation” of the Chinese nation. He wants this region of about 70 million people to rival the clusters of Tokyo Bay or San Francisco-Silicon Valley and the role they play in driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth.

Huawei reflects Xi’s grand vision for the Pearl River Delta. But as pressure from the Trump administration grows, executives of the company, which had a record $122 billion in sales last year, show signs of recognizing the changing, narrowing world in which they’re now living.

Guo Fulin, a two-decade veteran of the company who ran parts of its business in Europe and is now its president of international media affairs, deploys gnomic understatement to describe Huawei’s predicament. “The star in the sky will shine either to the west or to the east,” he says, meaning there will be opportunities for Huawei whether the U.S. slams the door shut or not. “We are not targeting every customer in the world. Customers who choose Huawei will eventually live better.”

With his actions—restricting sales of high-end semiconductors to Huawei, banning Americans from doing business with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat app—Trump threatened revenue and product development at China’s most innovative companies. The importance of that is magnified by the timing of his actions, which come as China is upgrading its industries, with many sectors still in need of expertise from abroad to complete the development Xi expects.

China’s leaders maintain their public commitment to the open, globalized world economy that’s benefited the nation so handsomely over the past two decades. But Xi is also adopting inward-looking ideas of self-sufficiency in a shift back to an industrial model less integrated into global supply chains. That’s not necessarily in China’s interest, says David Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury emissary to the country who’s now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “The danger is if you feel you have to respond to the U.S. protectionism with Chinese protectionism,” he says. “If you go down that road, then all this aspiration to become a more innovative economy is pretty hopeless.”

The Greater Bay Area strategy is rooted in an earlier time in Xi’s chairmanship that was all about China going out into the world through investment, acquisitions, and geopolitical partnership-building through initiatives such as the “Belt and Road” enterprise. First mooted by Shenzhen local authorities in 2014, and then elevated into a central government policy blueprint unveiled last year, the plan outlines the ambition to build a tech hub to “target the most advanced technologies and industries in the world.”

Far from Beijing and close to the open sea, the Pearl River Delta has long been China’s most mercantile and innovative place. The crowded islands that form Hong Kong and Macao remain separate jurisdictions even today, with their own laws, currencies, and political traditions shaped by the legacy of British and Portuguese colonialism. In Hong Kong, the differences between local society and the political culture across the border are a major source of friction, with hundreds of thousands of people in Hong Kong taking to the streets in often violent protests last year to push back against increased control by the Communist Party.

Standing among the futuristic towers of Shenzhen, just across the marshy borderland from Hong Kong, it’s easy to imagine the goal of technological leadership being within reach. In this city, mythologized as rising from a mere fishing village to a global metropolis within four decades, companies with a genuine claim to world leadership have their home.

More than a dozen Fortune Global 500 companies in the Guangzhou-Hong Kong-Shenzhen conurbation help drive a trillion-dollar economy that exports more than Japan does. The region spends double the national average on R&D, and Shenzhen alone accounts for more than a fifth of China’s high-end exports.

Huawei began in 1987 with its founder, Ren Zhengfei, repeatedly crossing the border, importing telephone switching gear from Hong Kong that he then resold to customers in China who were desperate for upgraded communications. Today the employee-owned company has sales in about 170 countries. At its corporate headquarters in Shenzhen, lavish reception rooms for visitors are modeled on Japan’s old Kyoto, with refreshments intended to make executives feel at ease before being pitched for deals on telecom hardware.

But the list of nations that see Huawei as a proxy for China’s geopolitical ambitions is growing. Following the U.S. lead, the U.K. is banning the company from its next-generation 5G networks and requiring that Huawei technology already installed in existing equipment be stripped out by 2027. Australia has shut the company out, as has Japan. India may curb Huawei and its tech neighbor in Shenzhen, ZTE Corp., from its networks as relations between the two states deteriorate.

This kind of tech decoupling could cost the world economy some $3.5 trillion in wasted output over the next five years, according to a report in July by Deutsche Bank AG. The costs arise from extra R&D, demand disruption, and supply chain rerouting that would become necessary if the current flow of know-how and parts—much of which already passes through China—shifts permanently.

That’s already happening at Huawei and, more broadly, in China. Huawei says that Trump sanctions enacted in May, which forbid companies using U.S. technology from supplying the Chinese company, cut it off from about 2% of its imported parts, which can’t be sourced elsewhere. To be able to completely replace lost technology could take Huawei an additional five to eight years, it says; outside estimates point to 10 years or more. That’s “a big loss for us,” Yu Chengdong, chief executive officer of Huawei’s consumer business group, said publicly in August.

Chinese leaders have frequently said that pressure from the outside will make the nation redouble its efforts to catch up technologically. There’s evidence that a broad push is under way to increase research and design capacity. Initial public offerings by Chinese semiconductor companies had raised a record $10 billion as of August as companies seek to localize supply chains.

That’s exactly the kind of duplication of effort that Deutsche Bank warns of, and there’s no guarantee that local companies can make up for what they’ve lost from the outside anytime soon. That could leave the GBA in the position of being a leading tech hub within and for China’s domestic market, but falling short of playing that role for the world.

Even as U.S. actions have hurt some tech companies in the Greater Bay Area, the Covid-19 pandemic has boosted others. The headquarters of Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co. is an appropriately clinical-looking, 35-story tower in Shenzhen’s Nanshan District. It manufactures, among other products, the SV800 and SV300 series of medical ventilators vital to treating patients severely affected by Covid-19.

The company’s three founders—including Li Xiting, a Singapore resident who was already the city-state’s second-richest man—had added about $17 billion to their combined wealth this year as demand soared. Mindray Vice President Huang Haitao says the company, which plows 10% of revenue back into R&D, aims to break into the global top 20 of medical equipment companies and push the industry’s frontiers into automation and artificial intelligence.

But Mindray, which says its medical equipment is used in the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and at Mayo Clinic campuses, may not be immune from U.S. targeting forever. In August, as part of his presidential campaign, Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden vowed to end American reliance on Chinese medical equipment. “Some parts of our equipment are manufactured in the U.S.,” Huang says. “For the sake of supply chain safety, we’ll abide by all American and international laws. At the same time, we’re also actively developing backup plans, which include looking for alternative suppliers.”

Innovation in the GBA is driven largely by companies, not universities, making the pace of progress more susceptible to the business cycle and the fortunes of any individual company. There is no Berkeley or Stanford here. China’s best minds in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics still graduate from Tsinghua and Peking universities in the capital and Fudan University in Shanghai, thousands of kilometers away.

That’s an issue singled out by Eric Guo, chief artificial intelligence scientist at Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp., the world’s fifth-largest smartphone manufacturer. The 36-year-old former Microsoft Corp. researcher has a Ph.D. from Purdue University in Indiana.

Sitting in corporate offices soon to be superseded by headquarters designed by Zaha Hadid, Guo praises the quality of life in Shenzhen. He points out that branches of China’s top-flight colleges are coming to Shenzhen, but more needs to be done, because the beauty and efficacy of university research is that it’s not constrained by making money in the short term. “Universities are the engines of innovation,” he says.

Less than 20 miles away, in central Hong Kong, it was university students who took to the streets during the summer of 2019, protesting first against a law that would erode the legal separation between the former British colony and the mainland, and then more generally against Beijing’s rule over the city.

In many ways, Hong Kong is doing what it’s always done—getting on with doing business with China—and it’s still the funnel through which most foreign direct investment flows into the wider GBA. But large parts of its population now see closer ties with the mainland as anathema, and rising tensions have divided a community that might have been expected to help knit together the GBA’s future economy.

That doesn’t bode well for what many in the business community see as the best long-term growth opportunities for either Hong Kong or the Greater Bay Area. “Hong Kong’s role is getting GBA companies to go global—a kind of adapter,” says Ben Simpfendorfer, founder of consulting firm Silk Road Associates. “Hong Kong needs to retain its connectivity to international markets.”

Beijing still pledges allegiance to the constitutional principle of “one country, two systems,” but the implementation of a national security law this past summer drew a quick response from the U.S., which removed a long-standing special trade privilege Hong Kong had enjoyed. That in itself “deepens pessimism” about the long-term business prospects in the city, according to a statement issued by the American Chamber of Commerce.

Policymakers in Beijing are plowing ahead with measures to ensure Hong Kong continues to play its role as the offshore financial center of the Greater Bay Area. The so-called Wealth Management Connect, for example, was announced in June, allowing residents in Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangdong to invest across the border.

But uncertainty is riding high. Nicholas Kwan, head of research for the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, stresses that without an open and connected business and political environment, the city can’t play its proper role in the broader strategy. “We can’t just be part of China,” he says. “We also have to be part of the rest of the world.”

Some would say the same of the Greater Bay Area. As it was when Deng Xiaoping opened the region to foreign investment four decades ago, China’s dynamic south has once more been handed the role of driving the nation’s rise. But in an era when China, like Huawei, is being challenged on all sides, grand economic growth projects like the GBA have no guarantee of success, and Xi’s plans for the region now hang in the balance. —With Edwin Chan, Gao Yuan, Venus Feng, and Iain Marlow

284,2020-09-29T21:00:09+00:00,Xi Jinping’s Tech Wonderland Runs Into Headwinds,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- At a new 400-acre research-and-development center on China’s south coast, Huawei Technologies Co. engineers chat, tap at their phones, or chill out on a small electric tram that whirs them between buildings modeled variously on the Sorbonne or England’s great universities. They move through neighborhoods built in the style of Versailles or Renaissance Italy, passing by some of the 3,000 gardening and maintenance staff needed to keep the vast parklands immaculate.

It’s late July, and on this Disneyland-like corporate campus about an hour and a half’s drive from Hong Kong, Huawei seems to be basking in the wealth from its leadership in 5G mobile technology. No other company has done more to project the image of a technologically advanced China on the international stage. And no other company stands as a greater symbol of China’s engagement with the outside world.

Huawei’s vaulting ambition to be at the forefront of future-defining technologies has landed the company in the crosshairs of the U.S. and other governments that see it as a conduit for the geopolitical objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.

286,2020-09-29T10:33:35+00:00,Hot-Desking Is a Good Way to Lose Your Best Staff,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Corporate bean counters must be tempted to slash office space as work-from-home advice resumes where Covid cases are surging. But succumbing will mean consequences for recruitment. It’s easy to forget that offices are a retention tool, and will remain so.

Everyone knows employers have incentives to pull people back to their desks. Offices facilitate free-flowing ideas and business leads, cultural cohesion and the seamless transfer of savoir-faire from senior employees to their juniors. And many employees want to return. Anecdotally, recent brief spells in semi-empty buildings have given a boost to some financial workers for any number of reasons: The clearer separation of professional obligations from personal life, the easing of pressure on relationships unaccustomed to one or both partners homeworking 24/7.

Just as before the pandemic, employees’ demands for flexibility are likely to include access to a pleasant office. Imagine a firm that decides to maintain its existing floor space despite partial homeworking, and allows every employee to have their own desk. With the office, say, two-thirds full, the square-foot-per-person-ratio shoots up to levels that would have been deemed profligate pre-Covid. But the staff like having their cake and eating it, and staff turnover falls.

Meanwhile, a rival firm shaves the rent bill by signing a lease for one-third less space and making everyone “hot desk” — employees with early morning duties like childcare always end up with the rubbish seat. Which of the two companies finds it easier to recruit?

Analysts at UBS Group AG point out that hot-desking risks being a false economy. Citing research by property group Great Portland Estates Plc, they estimate rental costs are equivalent to 5-10% of a typical London business’s revenue. Assuming salary costs account for around half, they ask: “Will management risk ‘100’ in revenue, and force the ‘50’ (i.e. employees) to desk share in order to save a percentage of the ‘5-10’?”

Story continues

For commercial property investors, the impact of increased homeworking will probably be mitigated by the need for less densely packed offices as long as the novel coronavirus remains a public-health threat. The most significant driver of demand is likely to remain employment, not working habits.

287,2020-09-29T10:33:35+00:00,Hot-Desking Is a Good Way to Lose Your Best Staff,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Corporate bean counters must be tempted to slash office space as work-from-home advice resumes where Covid cases are surging. But succumbing will mean consequences for recruitment. It’s easy to forget that offices are a retention tool, and will remain so.

Everyone knows employers have incentives to pull people back to their desks. Offices facilitate free-flowing ideas and business leads, cultural cohesion and the seamless transfer of savoir-faire from senior employees to their juniors. And many employees want to return. Anecdotally, recent brief spells in semi-empty buildings have given a boost to some financial workers for any number of reasons: The clearer separation of professional obligations from personal life, the easing of pressure on relationships unaccustomed to one or both partners homeworking 24/7.

Just as before the pandemic, employees’ demands for flexibility are likely to include access to a pleasant office. Imagine a firm that decides to maintain its existing floor space despite partial homeworking, and allows every employee to have their own desk. With the office, say, two-thirds full, the square-foot-per-person-ratio shoots up to levels that would have been deemed profligate pre-Covid. But the staff like having their cake and eating it, and staff turnover falls.

Meanwhile, a rival firm shaves the rent bill by signing a lease for one-third less space and making everyone “hot desk” — employees with early morning duties like childcare always end up with the rubbish seat. Which of the two companies finds it easier to recruit?

Analysts at UBS Group AG point out that hot-desking risks being a false economy. Citing research by property group Great Portland Estates Plc, they estimate rental costs are equivalent to 5-10% of a typical London business’s revenue. Assuming salary costs account for around half, they ask: “Will management risk ‘100’ in revenue, and force the ‘50’ (i.e. employees) to desk share in order to save a percentage of the ‘5-10’?”

Story continues

For commercial property investors, the impact of increased homeworking will probably be mitigated by the need for less densely packed offices as long as the novel coronavirus remains a public-health threat. The most significant driver of demand is likely to remain employment, not working habits.

If the analysis is right, it’s supportive of the London office market. The city already packs people in more tightly than most other financial centers, with only 9.5 square meters per desk versus 10.4 in New York, says UBS citing Cushman & Wakefield data. That may need to reverse. London’s vacancy rate is also low versus the U.S. financial capital, implying less slack.

288,2020-09-28T12:21:12+00:00,"Bloomin' Brands, Mesa Laboratories, Intuit, Target and Microsoft highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – September 28, 2020 – Zacks Equity Research Shares of Bloomin' Brands, Inc. BLMN  as the Bull of the Day, Mesa Laboratories, Inc. MLAB as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Intuit Inc. INTU, Target Corporation TGT and Microsoft Corporation MSFT.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus and the resulting shutdown orders have been devastating for the restaurant industry. Despite the efforts of Congress to provide fiscal stimulus – especially the PPP loans that allow small business owners to continue paying their employees - thousands of restaurants have shut their doors permanently and many of those remaining are in dire straits financially.

What hasn’t changed is Americans’ desire to eat their favorite foods from their favorite restaurants. In fact, the shutdown has people longing for a sense of normalcy and a restaurant meal is high on the list of things those people look forward to when they are once again able to go out in public as they please.

Bloomin’ Brands is positioned to thrive as businesses reopen for business and could even be the beneficiary of the fact that many smaller restaurants may not be around when those customers reemerge – hungry for a meal as well as the experience.

Most consumers will know Bloomin’ Brands as the operator of the popular Outback chain of Australian-style steakhouses. They also own Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse, Carraba’s Italian Grill and seafood restaurant Bonefish Grill. They operate the fast-casual Aussie Grill by Outback and the Abbrocio chain outside the US.

Since the first outlet opened in 1988, the Outback formula has been enormously successful, offering a steakhouse experience in a more casual, accessible and affordable format. On busy nights, it’s not uncommon for customers to wait in line for an hour or more for their favorite Outback favorites, including the fried onion appetizer that lends its name to the corporation – the Bloomin’ Onion.

Story continues

Typically, meat items are a restaurant’s lowest margin items, but Outback (and its corporate cousins) avoid that norm by having the economies of scale to order ingredients in bulk and also pad the bottom line with higher-margin appetizers, deserts, draft beer and wine by the glass.

The company adapted quickly to the unfortunate circumstance that saw the closure of in-person dining in the majority of their 1,450 restaurants, providing curbside pickup of individual items and complete family meal packages. They also scrambled to provide delivery options which have been a surprise hit.

Bloomin’ Brands provides investors and analysts with weekly sales data on their investor relations website, broken down by in-person and off-premise transactions. As you would expect, sales have declined quite a bit from the year-ago periods – especially same store sales at restaurants with no on-premise sales – but they’re not terrible.

Many diners have one or more favorite independent local restaurants that they prefer to frequent and will be disappointed if those businesses don’t survive the pandemic. It’s reality however that an operator with over 1,000 outlets has a big advantage in negotiating supply contracts, leases and employee schedules that the average neighborhood restaurant.

Bloomin’ Brands ended the second quarter of 2020 with $181 million in cash on the balance sheet, more than double the figure from the end of 2019 and a formidable war chest for implementing the changes necessary to survive the pandemic. You may or may not like it as a dining consumer, but as an investor, you have to appreciate that bigger chains like Bloomin’ will be around long after more specialized small competitors cry “uncle” and go out of business.

A look at earnings projections going forward fleshes out that idea. As expected, the remainder of 2020 looks pretty ugly with double-digit drops in revenue and triple digit declines in earnings.

Earnings in 2021 are expected to snap back however, and recent upward estimate revisions have reduced the expected losses this year and increased the expected profits next year, earning Bloomin’ Brands a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

It’s inevitable that the events of 2020 will reshape the landscape for many industries and restaurants are chief among them. Demand for their food certainly won’t go away, but a lot of the competition will. During times of radical change, it’s important to keep an eye on who the eventual winners might be. In chain restaurants, Bloomin’ Brands is an excellent candidate to come out the other side stronger than ever.

Bear of the Day:

Mesa Labs is a $1.2 billion provider of quality control monitoring and validation instruments serving niche markets in healthcare, industrial, pharmaceutical, medical and food processing applications.

In early August, Mesa reported its Q1 FY21 results (ended June) and came out with quarterly earnings of $1.67 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.94 per share a year ago.

And Mesa posted revenues of $29.94 million for the June quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.55%. This surpassed year-ago revenues of $26.29 million by 13.9%, but the company has not topped consensus revenue estimates but once over the last four quarters.

The June quarter represented a negative earnings surprise of -6.18%. For the March quarter, it was expected the company would post EPS of $2.03 when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a negative surprise of -36.45%. This followed a 69% EPS miss in the December quarter.

This trail of declining profit growth has led analysts to revise their full-year estimates lower. For FY 2021 (ends in March), the Zacks EPS Consensus has fallen 25% from $8.14 to $5.99 in the past month.

Investor and Analyst Reactions

Despite this outlook, investors are not running away from MLAB shares, even after a $135 million secondary offering in June. Mesa priced 600,000 shares at $225 on June 9 and the deal size was increased from $100M to $135M and priced below the last closing price of $235.99. Jefferies, JPMorgan and Evercore ISI are acting as joint book running managers for the offering.

In a September 1 model update from Jefferies, analyst Brandon Couillard and his team wrote about MLAB as ""a high-quality small-cap compounder with a defensive growth profile that is relatively insulated from the macro.""

The analysts noted that while near-term demand conditions had been impacted by the pandemic, they continue to believe that improved execution under new management, who are former Danaher executives, would offer new stability and organic growth opportunities.

And with over $200 million of cash on hand, they also like the possibility of additional M&A as a likely catalyst for the stock. They maintained their $290 PT.

Growth Stock Growing Pains = Volatility

I was once an investor in MLAB shares in Q4 of 2018 where we bought the stock for my Healthcare Innovators portfolio because I saw it as undervalued near $180 vs its growth rates of sales and profits. We sold at $220 and I've looked now and then at the growth profile for a reason to get back in.

While the stock has offered plenty of trading opportunities between $210 and $250 this year and last, I can't recommend buying the shares now until the estimates have stabilized and started heading back up. The Zacks Rank will let you know.

3 Stocks for Long-Term Investors to Buy Despite Market Turmoil

The market has tumbled since its early September records, with Wall Street yanking its foot off the gas to put on the breaks heading into the upcoming election, which is less than six weeks away. The uncertainty of the current environment is palpable and the market is deciding what to price in when it comes to possible changes in Washington.

Investors have also grown increasingly impatient about the lack of progress on the stimulus front, as the travel and broader hospitality industries remain devastated, alongside many smaller businesses. Meanwhile, the coronavirus is still hampering a more complete economic rebound in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere.

That said, the political will for a second round of lockdowns likely isn’t there as economies and people have no other logical alternative beyond learning to live with the virus the best they can. Plus, there continue to be signs of a slow and steady economic recovery, while the earnings outlook continues to improve.

Market Movement

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have tumbled, as the big tech names fall back down a little closer to earth. The tech-heavy index is down roughly 12% from its September 2 peak, with the proxy index for the broader market 9.7% off the pace—right below the 10% decline that would mark a technical correction.

These moves are common and healthy. In fact, there have been 24 market corrections since November 1974. And only five of them turned into bear markets, including the violent tumble the market experienced in February and March.

There is no way to predict what will happen next, though technical traders currently point to the 200-day moving average as the next big level to watch (nearby chart). Instead, investors must try to remember that someone is always on the other side of a trade. So as the market falls, the big money is likely scooping up stocks. And trying to time the market is very difficult.

Let’s also remember that the Fed plans to keep its interest rates near zero through at least 2023. Like it or not, this creates a sustained TINA effect—there is no alternative—as Wall Street hunts for returns in a yield-starved market.

With all of this in mind, investors with a longer-term horizon of at least a year or more might want to consider adding a few strong stocks right now despite the turmoil…

Intuit

Intuit is part of the growing cloud-based SaaS industry, which includes Adobe, Zoom Video and countless others, that has flexed its muscles during the pandemic. These software firms have become so integral to businesses and consumers that they are hard to replace. INTU offers a variety of financial services and it is most famous for its online tax software, TurboTax. The company also sells software geared toward accounting, small business money management, and personal finance, which include QuickBooks and Mint.

Intuit boasts roughly 50 million customers globally and has seen its annual revenue grow by between 11% and 16% for the last five years. The firm topped our Q4 FY20 estimates in late August, with FY20 revenue up 13%. Zacks estimates call for its FY21 revenue to jump 7%, with FY22 projected to come in over 11% higher. INTU’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 8.5% and 13.2% over this stretch.

Intuit’s positive earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The stock is also part of a highly-ranked Zacks industry and its 0.76% dividend yield tops the 10-year U.S. Treasury. INTU shares have crushed the tech sector over the last five years, up 250%. And Intuit’s tax-focused offerings are unlikely to go out of style, as the saying goes, with its shares resting 15% off their early September highs.

Target

Target has boosted its e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business, including a variety of same-day offerings. The firm has also invested in a strategic brick-and-mortar approach that will likely continue to pay off, as e-commerce accounted for just 16% of total U.S. retail sales in Q2—up from 10.8% in Q2 FY19. TGT has kept and attracted younger consumers, unlike department stores, through trendy and affordable furniture, home décor, fashion, food, and more.

The Minneapolis-based retailer’s Q1 sales jumped 11%, with Q2 sales up 25%. TGT’s Q2 digital comps soared 195% and it also posted one of its strongest quarters of in-store comps on record, up 10.9%. Meanwhile, its operating margin climbed from 7% in Q2 FY19 to 10%, which comes in well above Walmart and Amazon.

Target shares are up 160% in the last three years to top WMT’s 72%. TGT is also up nearly 30% in the last three months and still rests near its highs, despite the broader selloff. Target also trades at a discount, as it has for years, to its industry and its peer group. And TGT's 1.79% dividend yield tops Walmart and the 30-year Treasury’s 1.42%.

Zacks estimates call for TGT’s adjusted Q3 earnings to jump 10.3% on 10% stronger sales. Meanwhile, its adjusted fiscal 2020 EPS figure is expected to jump 12% on 12.4% higher revenue. Target’s positive bottom-line trends help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

Microsoft

Microsoft’s Office offerings remain vital to businesses, students, and many others, and it has boosted its remote work push to better compete against Zoom and others. Meanwhile, its next-generation Xbox is due out this holiday season and it recently increased its bet on the booming gaming industry. On top of all of that, and perhaps most importantly, Microsoft is a leader in the cloud computing market and its expansion continues to drive top and bottom-line growth (also read: Why Microsoft Paid $7.5 Billion for Gaming Wizard ZeniMax).

MSFT’s revenue has jumped by roughly 14% for three straight years, with its Q4 FY20 (period ended June 30) sales up 13% amid the height of the pandemic. Zacks estimates call for the historic tech firm’s FY21 revenue to climb 9% and another 10% in FY22, with its adjusted earnings projected to pop 11% and 12.5%, respectively. Microsoft lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now and it has seen some positive longer-term revisions recently.

Microsoft, which holds “A” grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system, holds around $137 billion in cash and equivalents. This gives it the ability to continue to make both small and large acquisitions. Plus, MSFT has outpaced Facebook, Google, Apple and Netflix over the last five years. Microsoft’s shares rest roughly 12% below their highs and its 1.09% dividend yield tops the 10-year Treasury and Apple’s 0.75%.

Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential

The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They’re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.

The stock is also part of a highly-ranked Zacks industry and its 0.76% dividend yield tops the 10-year U.S. Treasury. INTU shares have crushed the tech sector over the last five years, up 250%. And Intuit’s tax-focused offerings are unlikely to go out of style, as the saying goes, with its shares resting 15% off their early September highs.

Target

Target has boosted its e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business, including a variety of same-day offerings. The firm has also invested in a strategic brick-and-mortar approach that will likely continue to pay off, as e-commerce accounted for just 16% of total U.S. retail sales in Q2—up from 10.8% in Q2 FY19. TGT has kept and attracted younger consumers, unlike department stores, through trendy and affordable furniture, home décor, fashion, food, and more.

The Minneapolis-based retailer’s Q1 sales jumped 11%, with Q2 sales up 25%. TGT’s Q2 digital comps soared 195% and it also posted one of its strongest quarters of in-store comps on record, up 10.9%. Meanwhile, its operating margin climbed from 7% in Q2 FY19 to 10%, which comes in well above Walmart and Amazon.

Target shares are up 160% in the last three years to top WMT’s 72%. TGT is also up nearly 30% in the last three months and still rests near its highs, despite the broader selloff. Target also trades at a discount, as it has for years, to its industry and its peer group. And TGT's 1.79% dividend yield tops Walmart and the 30-year Treasury’s 1.42%.

Zacks estimates call for TGT’s adjusted Q3 earnings to jump 10.3% on 10% stronger sales. Meanwhile, its adjusted fiscal 2020 EPS figure is expected to jump 12% on 12.4% higher revenue. Target’s positive bottom-line trends help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

Microsoft

Microsoft’s Office offerings remain vital to businesses, students, and many others, and it has boosted its remote work push to better compete against Zoom and others. Meanwhile, its next-generation Xbox is due out this holiday season and it recently increased its bet on the booming gaming industry. On top of all of that, and perhaps most importantly, Microsoft is a leader in the cloud computing market and its expansion continues to drive top and bottom-line growth (also read: Why Microsoft Paid $7.5 Billion for Gaming Wizard ZeniMax).

MSFT’s revenue has jumped by roughly 14% for three straight years, with its Q4 FY20 (period ended June 30) sales up 13% amid the height of the pandemic. Zacks estimates call for the historic tech firm’s FY21 revenue to climb 9% and another 10% in FY22, with its adjusted earnings projected to pop 11% and 12.5%, respectively. Microsoft lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now and it has seen some positive longer-term revisions recently.

Microsoft, which holds “A” grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system, holds around $137 billion in cash and equivalents. This gives it the ability to continue to make both small and large acquisitions. Plus, MSFT has outpaced Facebook, Google, Apple and Netflix over the last five years. Microsoft’s shares rest roughly 12% below their highs and its 1.09% dividend yield tops the 10-year Treasury and Apple’s 0.75%.

290,2020-09-28T04:00:00+00:00,"Gaming, E-Commerce Deals Herald New Age for Polish Tech","(Bloomberg) -- A flurry of big-ticket gaming, e-commerce and telecoms announcements has focused the attention of tech investors on an unlikely destination: Poland.

Arguably better known for defending its smokestack industries from European Union climate goals, Poland has quietly developed a number of growing tech companies.

This month’s initial public offering by online marketplace Allegro is the biggest ever in Warsaw and worth as much as $2.7 billion. CD Projekt SA, Europe’s second-biggest biggest gaming company, plans to release its make-or-break futuristic Cyberpunk 2077 game in November, already dubbed as the most awaited launch this year. Mobile games producer Huuuge Inc. and People Can Fly SA, a studio that helped make Fortnite, also plan to list shares in Warsaw later this year.

While European governments have repeatedly tried and failed to create the continent’s own version of Silicon Valley, Poland’s digital remake is fed by local IT talent, an upwardly-mobile population and still low operational costs. The government has offered tax breaks for tech investments and switched to cloud technologies in partnership with Google Inc. and Microsoft Inc.

The change in consumer habits online has benefited companies beyond those purely focused on e-commerce. Advent International is considering the sale of Polish postal locker provider InPost SA, valuing the company -- that been boosted by an increase online shopping -- at about $2.3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

France’s Iliad SA is buying for $2.6 billion Polish mobile phone operator Play Communications SA, which has successfully disrupted rivals including local units of Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG.

Aman Ghei, principal at Finch Capital technology fund in London, said Poland’s IT industry has reached critical mass and its talent pool as “one of the best in Europe.” Still, it may be difficult to expect a large stream of public deals.

“For IPOs in local markets, you need serious scale -- and Allegro is a massive business well known to investors,” Ghei said by email. “It becomes a bit more challenging for enterprise software companies that are not well-known to the institutional and retail investor base as they need to provide free float for it to be a successful deal.”

Story continues

Part of the allure of Allegro, which makes money through fees for sellers who list products on its website, is that online still accounts for about 8% of retail sales in the country, about half as much as in the U.K. and a third of the share in China.

Another boon for the company, whose gross merchandise volume jumped 54% to 16 billion zloty ($4.1 billion) in the first half of 2020, is that Amazon.com Inc still sells to Polish consumers through its German subsidiary, limiting its appeal.

Allegro and CD Projekt together are set to become the two biggest Warsaw-listed companies -- highlighting the shift away from old-economy industrials and banks that have dominated the WIG20 index.

There is uncertainty about sustainability of the current boom. The accession to the European Union in 2004 allowed for access to broad markets, but also triggered a brain drain. Europe’s most-valued start-up, Swedish payment provider Klarna AB, was started by immigrant Pole Sebastian Siemiatkowski, and U.S. software house Snowflake Inc., co-founded by Marcin Zukowski.

For years, tech-savvy graduates have been a sought-after resource for companies relocating IT and data departments to Poland, where programmers’ salaries are still about half of paychecks in neighboring Germany. Some of them started to flourish with their own start-up ideas.

In 2006, two years after Poland joined the European Union, the founder of Huuuge, the mobile game maker with $260 million of sales last year, relocated his IT business from Finland to the western Polish city of Szczecin, just as Nokia started its decline as a European tech champion.

“Some peers considered that as a bold and risky move, which it certainly was,” Anton Gauffin said in email. “Those were the years where we learned how to build truly exceptional mobile games. Poland should be proud of its gaming talent.”

* Musk has hinted at significant new battery developments

* Partners and acquisitions have helped give Tesla an edge (Updates sourcing for paragraph 35)

By Paul Lienert, Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is hailed as an innovator and disruptor who went from knowing next to nothing about building cars to running the world's most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years.

But his record shows he is more of a fast learner who forged alliances with firms that had technology Tesla lacked, hired some of their most talented people, and then powered through the boundaries that limited more risk-averse partners.

Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla's drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its ""Battery Day"" event on Sept. 22.

Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.

New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan's Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.

""Elon doesn't want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,"" said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. ""And for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.""

Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea's LG Chem and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.

But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs — at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.

Story continues

""There has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,"" Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.

""Our relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There's no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.""

Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

MAKE EVERYTHING

Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk's goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla's control, people familiar with Tesla's strategy said.

They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co's iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.

""Elon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,"" said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. ""He wanted to make everything.""

Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.

""Tell him 'No', and then he really wants to do it,"" said a third former Tesla veteran.

The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.

Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.

'STRAIGHT FOR MARS'

Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada ""Gigafactory"", while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla's Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.

Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.

But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn't happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.

Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.

The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.

During its development alliance with Germany's Daimler , which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.

Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.

""He learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,"" said a senior Daimler engineer said.

Meanwhile, an association with Japan's Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.

Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.

THE MUSK SPIN

Some relationships did not end well, however.

Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla's Autopilot.

""Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,"" said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.

Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.

But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.

At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla's Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.

The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.

U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.

""Nvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,"" said Nvidia's senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.

In addition to partnerships, Musk went on an acquisition spree four years ago, buying a handful of little-known companies - Grohmann, Perbix, Riviera, Compass, Hibar Systems - to rapidly advance Tesla's expertise in automation. Maxwell and SilLion further boosted Tesla's ability in battery technology.

""He learned a lot from those people,"" said Mark Ellis, a senior consultant at Munro & Associates, which has studied Tesla extensively. ""He leveraged a lot of information from them, then put his spin on making it better.""

THE MUSK SPIN

Some relationships did not end well, however.

Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla's Autopilot.

""Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,"" said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.

Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.

But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.

At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla's Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.

The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.

U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.

""Nvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,"" said Nvidia's senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.

In addition to partnerships, Musk went on an acquisition spree four years ago, buying a handful of little-known companies - Grohmann, Perbix, Riviera, Compass, Hibar Systems - to rapidly advance Tesla's expertise in automation. Maxwell and SilLion further boosted Tesla's ability in battery technology.

""He learned a lot from those people,"" said Mark Ellis, a senior consultant at Munro & Associates, which has studied Tesla extensively. ""He leveraged a lot of information from them, then put his spin on making it better.""

NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Equity markets rose and the dollar firmed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, as expected, and said it would continue its bond-buying program to stimulate the U.S. economy as part of a dovish policy stance.

Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose and gold prices edged higher after the Fed promised to keep rates on hold until inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the U.S. central bank's 2% inflation target ""for some time.""

""They want to be dovish. They want to be super dovish. The market is priced for dovish,"" said Nancy Davis, managing partner and chief investment officer at Quadratic Capital Management LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.

""Nobody thinks there's going to be any kind of inflation at all and the guidance is more dovish and in line with what the market expected,"" Davis said, adding that she believes there is a danger inflation could exceed expectations.

New economic projections released with the Fed's policy statement showed rates on hold through at least 2023, with inflation never breaching 2% over that time. Policymakers saw the economy shrinking 3.7% this year, far less steep than the 6.5% decline forecast in June. Unemployment, which registered 8.4% in August, was seen falling to 7.6% by the end of the year.

At the Fed's last meeting in August the U.S. central bank adopted a new approach to inflation and unemployment that will allow the economy to run a little hotter than in the past to help ensure jobs growth for lower income earners.

MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets rose 0.25% to 577.1, while its emerging markets index rose 0.48%.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.72% and the S&P 500 gained 0.20%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.45%, pulled lower by declines in Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp - stocks that have propelled the index to record highs this year.

In Europe, the broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.49% at 1,446.16. London's FTSE 100 lagged gains by other European indices, down 0.44% at the close, but the struggling pound was propped up by a weaker dollar.

European retail stocks surged on strong results from Zara-owner Inditex after it said there was a progressive return to normality, with online sales growing sharply and store sales recovering. Shares of the Spanish retailer jumped 8.1%.

U.S. consumer spending slowed in August, with retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services sliding 0.1% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in July.

Retail sales lost a little steam in August, but consumers overall are still doing well despite modest weakness relative to expectations, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial at Troy, Michigan.

When the pandemic slowed economic growth, consumers were in a relatively strong financial condition, the direct opposite of what is normally the case for an economic downturn, he said.

""Consumers are still overall doing well despite the modest weakness relative to expectations,"" Price said.

The yen rose overnight and extended gains that hit a nearly seven-week high of 104.995 to the dollar as investors sought safer assets.

The dollar index rose 0.016%, with the euro down 0.34% to $1.1805.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.44% versus the greenback at 104.95 per dollar.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.2% at $1,970.50 an ounce. Spot gold prices rose 0.14% to $1,958.26 an ounce.

Brent crude futures rose $1.69 to settle at $42.22 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures settled up $1.88 at $40.16 a barrel.

Zinc prices pushed toward a 16-month highs hit earlier this month as resurgent Chinese industry bolstered the outlook for demand and the yuan strengthened, making metals more affordable for Chinese buyers.

Oil prices rose for a second day, up more than 2%, as Hurricane Sally closed U.S. offshore production and an industry report showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly decreased.

297,2020-09-15T16:24:21+00:00,Reasons To Believe In A Tempting Tech ETF,"The darling technology sector took some lumps earlier this month, but consensus wisdom appears to be that was a mere blip and the group will get its groove back if it's not already doing so.

What Happened

Of course, that would be beneficial to the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL), which is one of the premier leveraged plays on the largest sector in the S&P 500.

TECL tries to deliver triple the daily performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, essentially making the Direxion exchange traded fund a geared play on Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) because those stocks combine for over 44% of the Technology Select Sector Index.

Why It's Important

When the technology sector hits bumps in the road, inevitably, there are calls that the 2000 tech wreck is going to repeat. Should that happen, TECL, predictably, would be a disastrous ETF to be holding. Fortunately, a 2000 sequel isn't brewing.

“When we compare the most recent run-up in IT to its counterpart from 20 years ago, we observe that the current relative outperformance of the sector is much less extreme than during the late 1990s,” notes S&P Dow Jones Indices. “Moreover, the relative volatility of the IT sector was much higher then (December 1996-December 2000) than it is now, with an annualized standard deviation of daily relative returns of 23%—almost two and a half times the current period’s standard deviation of 9.5% (December 2016-August 2020).”

The 2000 bursting of the tech bubble washed out an array of flimsy companies. However, it's not a stretch to say that while the sector won't move up in a straight line, components in TECL's underlying index are far stronger today than they were two decades ago.

What's Next

There is, of course, something to that strength, which is derived in large part from significant economic moats and fortress-like balance sheets. Additionally, that strength can augur well for reduced volatility with TECL.

Story continues

“In 1999 and the present, IT had a strong tilt toward momentum and high beta and a tilt away from value,” according to S&P Dow Jones. “However, one of the main differences between now and then is that IT currently has much stronger tilts toward quality and low volatility than it did in 1999. This suggests that the companies within the current IT sector are both more profitable and less volatile now than they were 20 years ago.”

What Happened

With the likes of Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) punished last week, the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECL) felt plenty of pain, too.

TECL looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, making it an easy target for downside when Apple and friends retreat.

Why It's Important

“I think we should start to anticipate a rotation—the momentum behind tech is going to ease,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told the Wall Street Journal. “As we’re seeing easing lockdowns and the prospect of a vaccine, people are beginning to go back to a more normal way of life, and reliance on tech is starting to fade from the peak where it was at the height of the lockdown.”

That may be the case over the near-term, but data suggest traders didn't go running for the hills with TECL amid the tech pullback. They did the opposite. Month-to-date, inflows to the leverage tech ETF are approaching $42 million.

That's not a massive sum, but it says traders are convinced tech's early September retreat is a bump in the road, not cause for ongoing concern.

TECL could be starting to get its groove back. Yes, the geared fund is lower by a staggering 23.17% over the past week, but it surged 9.28% on Wednesday on volume that was roughly 60% above the daily average, providing another sign traders that stick by the fund are being rewarded.

What's Next

Over the course of tech's ascent this year, retreats have been brief and rebounds rapid, scenarios that amplify the risk of holding a leveraged fund like TECL for more than a few days.

Speaking of risk, some bold traders aren't shying away from making bearish bets against the beloved tech sector. To start September, nearly $10 million has flowed into TECL's bearish cousin – the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS).

Story continues

Interestingly, traders have been tempting fate with the bearish TECS for most of this year as highlighted by 2020 inflows of almost $97 million.

By Tom Arnold and Tom Westbrook

LONDON/SINGAPORE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - World shares slipped from record highs on Friday, and were on course for their worst week in more than two months, while gains in bonds and the dollar were modest as investors waited to see if U.S. jobs data triggers a bigger sell-off.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index traded flat after earlier rebounding from its worst day in more than a month a day before amid a tech-led plunge on Wall Street on Thursday.

German industrial goods orders rose by a smaller-than-expected 2.8% on the month in July, undermining hopes of recovery for Europe's largest economy from the coronavirus shock.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3% and looked set to snap a six-week winning streak with its biggest weekly loss since April. Japan's benchmark Nikkei share average closed down 1.1%.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries and had touched record highs earlier on Thursday, shed 0.2%.

""Stock market valuation is rich on a stand-alone basis, but far less extreme compared to other asset classes. Hence, it's likely a bit too soon to be calling the next bear market even though September 3 did mark the top of the equity market back in 1929,"" said Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at Robeco.

U.S. futures were mixed, recovering some ground after heavier losses earlier in the session. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4% and S&P 500 futures were 0.5% up.

The market focus is now on U.S. payrolls due at 1230 GMT, which could be a selling trigger if an expected slowdown in hiring is deeper than forecast.

""I don't think a huge number of investors will be adjusting their positions ahead of the U.S. payroll data but because of yesterday's sell-off there will be a bit more sensitivity to the data,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

Story continues

""U.S. jobs data has been pretty consistently awful in a big picture sense. Fundamentally, there is nothing that can happen in payrolls that can tell you much more about the trajectory of the economy.""

Foreign exchange markets were on edge at the possibility and a safety bid helped the dollar cling to gains that have it headed for its best week in more than two months.

The euro, which has fallen from a 28-month peak above $1.20 on talk the European Central Bank is concerned about its strength, seems to have eased its slide for now, and last sat at $1.1852.

The yen was steady at 106.16 per dollar and bonds pared what was a pretty modest rise overnight, given the sell-off in the equity market.

Elsewhere, Turkey's lira weakened for a fifth straight session to a new record low as pressure rose on the central bank to tighten credit amid stubbornly high inflation.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yields rose about 3 basis points on Friday, having fallen overnight.

German yields stabilised, having fallen the day before on equity sell-offs.

TECH TUMBLE, BANKS SURGE

Thursday's tumble was the biggest one-day percentage drop on the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 since March and the darling stocks of recent months were hit hardest.

Still, the plunge in Apple, Tesla and Microsoft only wound the Nasdaq back as far as where it sat last Tuesday. It is still up 28% for the year so far and 73% higher than its March trough.

""No single factor sparked the sell-off,"" said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, citing more general worries the rally had run too far, too fast.

""However, this is unlikely to be a repeat of the tech wreck of the late 1990s, given how much the market and sector have changed,"" he added.

In Europe, technology shares fell back after limited tech selling in Asia.

The bank index helped offset tech's woes, with Spanish banks Bankia and Caixabank both marking double-digit gains earlier in the session after they said they were considering a merger to create the biggest lender in Spain. In commodity markets, oil was headed for its largest weekly drop since June amid worries about demand as the U.S. summer driving season draws to a close.

Brent crude futures were up 0.6% at $44.35 a barrel and U.S. crude was 0.8% higher at $41.69 a barrel.

Gold added 0.4% as investors sought out the safety of the precious metal ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls data.

302,2020-09-03T16:20:29+00:00,Why the explosive stock market rally is suddenly crumbling,"A red-hot stock market may be starting to get crushed under the weight of its own inflated valuation.

Seemingly out of the blue, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked nearly 800 points on Thursday by early afternoon trading. More alarmingly, the Nasdaq Composite — which has led the rally off the late February lows — plunged about 4%.

Some of the sector’s strongest-performers in recent months were walloped Thursday: Amazon (-5%), Apple (-7%), Microsoft (-5%), Tesla (-7%), Zoom (-11%), Square (-7%) to name a few. Indeed the selloff in these tech giants has served as a red flag on the rally’s near-term sustainability for the bulls, which have also watched an under-the-radar rotation into more defensive names this week such as Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola.

Talk to those on the Street and a selloff right now makes sense, and is long overdue.

For starters, valuations on big tech names like Tesla have gotten completely out of whack with reasonable expectations on forward earnings. A signal on that front was sent on Tesla Wednesday, as one of its largest shareholders Baillie Gifford trimmed its stake after a meteoric run-up in the stock. Meantime, billionaire investor Mario Gabelli hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer he may soon trim some of his position in Apple (another 2020 high-flyer).

And then there is the raw economic data that hasn’t improved much in recent weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. Or at least hasn’t turned around enough to warrant the S&P 500 trading at a lofty forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22 times.

“It could be the start [of a correction],” Belpointe Asset Management chief strategist David Nelson told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. “I don’t think the stock market — and particularly the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — really represents what is going on in the economy.” Exterior of New York Stock Exchange Building with classical architecture of Greece columns and US flags as seen during the day, NYSE Financial organization at Wall Street a symbol for the global and American Economy as one of the most powerful financial institute at lower Manhattan New York City, United States of America.

To top it all off, there are the seasonal September forces — and what will be a heated presidential election — the bulls seem to have forgotten about.

Story continues

September tends to be a weak month for stocks historically. In fact, according to LPL Financial, September has been the worst-performing month for markets, on average, since 1950. The S&P 500 has dropped about 1% on average that month since 1950, LPL Financial data shows. The only other month to record a drop on average (and a minuscule one at that) going back to 1950 is August.

But this time around, September being lackluster for markets could be further solidified because of election-related uncertainty. LPL Financial data reveals that the S&P 500 has shed 0.2% on average in an election year.

“When we look at Tesla, it’s trading at a market cap of $455 billion which is 10 times what General Motors is trading at. And so we have to wonder can fundamental analysis sustains some of these valuations? When we look at Zoom, it’s trading at more than IBM and at a P/E ratio of over 500 times versus IBM at 15 times. What I think is happening is investors are starting to scrutinize the valuations a bit more,” says Greg Branch, an adviser at 1847 Financial.

Although VirtnetX has been referred to as a patent troll with its contention that it owns most of the crucial patents related to security across the internet, it has gone after most of the top tech stocks, including Apple, Cisco, and Microsoft, to enforce them, and has been mostly successful.

Apple appealed its loss all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and while it has won minor victories along the way, such as rulings that FaceTime doesn't infringe on the patents, the larger battles have fallen VirnetX's way, and Apple may be running out of ways to avoid paying the judgment.

The latest decision derives from Apple's appeal of a federal court's ruling that its VPN-on-demand feature, which allows you to configure a secure connection anonymously to keep your data safe, violated two of VirnetX's patents.

VirnetX was awarded a total of $439.7 million in damages.

Academic research papers are being churned out to explain just how Covid-19 has changed the world of business permanently. Some industries and sectors have fared much better than others during the crisis.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is just one example of a company that’s benefited from Covid-19, with higher e-commerce revenue, greater demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and even growth in digital advertising. Founder Jeff Bezos is now worth almost $200 billion as a result of AMZN stock rising by 80% in the first nine months of 2020.

7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns

Of course, some industries haven’t fared nearly as well. Airlines are one sector unlikely to see any semblance of normalcy for several years.

So which are the best industries to invest in right now? Here are 10 long-term stocks to ride this wave:

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) Prologis (NYSE:PLD) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Accor (OTCMKTS:ACCYY) Kinaxis (OTCMKTS:KXSCF) Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teladoc (NASDAQ:TDOC) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)

While these stocks have benefited from coronavirus tailwinds, they were already well-positioned for gains in our increasingly-digitized world. Let’s dive right in.

Amazon isn’t the only e-commerce business to benefit from Covid-19, but it is the biggest.

Stock Twits founder Howard Lindzon recently interviewed Alex Danco on his Panic With Friends podcast. Danco’s take on Amazon says all you need to know about Jeff Bezos and company:

“In order to compete against Amazon, you need to have taste or you need to be ok with losing.”

Story continues

A lot of people probably think they have taste, but Danco’s talking about bankable taste, and that’s much harder to come by. In March 2018, I argued that Amazon wanted to own your home. Not literally, of course, but to be the provider of every product and service found in your house.

And it would do so through its Prime services.

“In Amazon’s case, it increases the number of Prime members and the amount those members spend annually by providing everything you need to run your home and life,” I said back in 2018. “Over time, revenues will exponentially climb, and with it, the price of Amazon stock.”

AMZN stock is up 127% in the two years since. I expect it to continue to move higher as it grabs additional market share across people’s lives. Covid-19 tailwinds have only accelerated this land grab.

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office

Intuitive Surgical was a major player in robotics even before Covid-19 hit the world. Now, its surgical systems have become crucial to medical professionals.

Wired published an article in March discussing the difficulties of getting robots into hospitals:

“A cruel irony of the coronavirus pandemic is that medical professionals know better than anyone that social distancing is critical for slowing the rate of new infections, yet they’re forced to be the closest to the disease. And those that need social interaction perhaps more than anybody — the elderly — are the ones who need to isolate the most, since they’re the most susceptible to the disease.”

In this instance, writer Matt Simon is talking about robots providing care to patients in hospitals and the like, but it illustrates why robotics are necessary to the future success of hospitals and other medical facilities.

Intuitive could also partner with iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) to develop a robotic orderly that helps humans do their jobs more effectively while reducing the spread of infectious diseases.

With Intuitive already a big part of hospital life, the acceleration of robotics in healthcare is bound to help ISRG stock continue moving higher.

This segment of the real estate industry was benefiting from e-commerce long before the pandemic struck. However, Covid-19 has accelerated this trend.

“Accelerated adoption of e-commerce was definitely a positive trend of the pandemic,” said Michael Coppola, a partner with Bluewater Property Group. “E-commerce has changed our industry. We’ll all be attuned to how much of that sticks.”

How good has this positive trend been for owners of industrial real estate? Beyond their wildest expectations.

“The e-commerce increases we’ve seen in the last few months have been astounding,” Duke Realty vice president of leasing and development, Stephanie Rodriguez, said in June. “In this short amount of time, we’re outpacing where we thought we’d be in three years.”

Prologis, the world leader in logistics real estate with 963 million square feet of space in 19 countries, is ideally situated to benefit from this acceleration. Despite the gains it will be seeing from e-commerce, PLD stock is up just 14.6% year to date through August 26.

As far as long-term stocks go, I think investors are undervaluing Prologis’ future potential in 2020. Look for that to change in 2021 and beyond.

With so many people working from home for the foreseeable future, augmented reality (AR) is going to experience an acceleration in demand for products that allow businesses to provide a simulated in-person customer experience.

“[T]he use of AR technology for collaboration and remote support of frontline workers has soared, enabling experts to be much more productive in helping to debug problems and resolve production issues remotely,” U.K. industrial innovation technology specialist Jim Heppelmann told IoTNow in May.

“COVID-19 has meant industry has been forced to adapt quicker than it probably would have done under normal economic circumstances, but now they’ve had a taste of the operational and financial benefits it can deliver, I can see a major rise in adoption.”

In April, InvestorPlace contributor Eric Fry discussed how Covid-19 would accelerate technology changes, and how Nvidia would benefit from those changes.

“To protect your portfolio, you need to have exposure to these nascent trends. And let’s be clear: All roads lead to Nvidia. Thanks to the company’s dominance of the GPU market, it is at the very center of several powerful multi-decade growth waves, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, AI and machine learning,” Fry stated back on April 8.

I couldn’t agree more. That’s why I believe NVDA stock is an excellent long-term buy.

Accor (ACCYY) A person cooks something in a smoking wok

I would bet my left arm that one of the big companies operating ghost kitchens in the U.S. will merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in the next 12 months. It’s a business that just seems tailor-made for someone with a big name in the restaurant industry to raise half a billion and find such a target.

But this isn’t about SPACs; it’s about ghost kitchens, and ACCYY stock in particular.

At the end of June, The New Yorker discussed why ghost kitchens would be our future. If you don’t know what a ghost kitchen is, it is a restaurant that’s expressly set up for take-out and delivery only — no in-house dining.

The subject of the article was Reef Technology, which is backed by SoftBank Group (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). Reef operates kitchens in 18 cities across the U.S. It also repurposes parking lots into dining spaces. The pandemic has accelerated its plans.

In February, I recommended Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) because of C3, the mall owner’s partnership with SBE Entertainment Group and Accor, to develop 200 ghost kitchens in the U.S. by the end of 2020.

While a lot of restaurants have been laying off people, C3’s been hiring. While you could go with Simon, I like Accor because it owns 50% of SBE Entertainment Group, run by hospitality and real estate entrepreneur Sam Nazarian.

Malls have to do something with all that empty retail space. Why not ghost kitchens?

Kinaxis (KXSCF) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights

Of all the stocks on this list, Kinaxis is most likely the one least familiar to U.S. investors.

Based in Ottawa, Ontario, the company’s RapidResponse cloud-based supply chain management software has garnered a lot of attention, not to mention business, this year due to all of the supply chain issues resulting from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

My wife is in the construction business. You wouldn’t think it would be hard to get ahold of bathtubs right now, but the pandemic has made it difficult for companies across industries to maintain their supply chains.

On August 10, Kinaxis raised its guidance for 2020. Covid-19 had everything to do with that change. In the three months ended June 30, company sales increased by 45% over last year to $61.3 million. In 2020, it expects revenue of at least $216 million, up from guidance of $211 million in the previous quarter.

“Kinaxis has quite simply never been more relevant,” stated CEO John Sicard in a statement. “There has never been more attention on global supply chain resilience and the power of concurrent planning to provide the agility needed to respond to daily disruption.”

7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns

Back in 2018, I discussed how Toyota (NYSE:TM) started using Kinaxis’ software to handle its supply planning instead of doing it by hand. I expect more companies to lean on Kinaxis in the years ahead as supply chain management becomes even more critical than it already is.

Chegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass

Last July, I wrote about seven stocks to invest in that are making life easier for students. One of those picks was Chegg, an online platform that helps individuals become better students by providing tutoring, writing instruction and grammar correction, better study aids, etc.

“Chegg might not be profitable just yet, but it will be. Buy in now while its shares are still affordable,” I wrote on July 16, 2019.

Chegg is up 75% since then.

In the second quarter, Chegg had 3.9 million subscribers for its Chegg Services offering, which includes all of the aforementioned services. For the quarter, subscriber base grew by 29%, while revenue was up 31%. With permanent changes to education expected post-Covid-19, Chegg delivers a winning formula.

It might fall back in the near-term, given how hot it’s been in 2020. However, long-term, I like it a lot. And so does Piper Sandler. which has an overweight rating and a $90 target price on CHGG stock.

Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.

The obvious pick when it comes to virtual meetings stocks is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), whose stock was trading below $70 at the start of the year and now is closing in on $300.

While there’s no denying its success, Zoom is a niche specialist. By contrast, Microsoft has several businesses that have benefited from Covid-19 — Teams, Cloud, Gaming and Windows — and should continue to outperform the competition in the months and years ahead.

Now Microsoft is teaming with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to buy TikTok’s U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand businesses. Estimates suggest the duo will have to pay anywhere from $20 to $30 billion for the short-form video application’s business in those countries.

While there are other bidders for TikTok, there’s no doubt that they’ll be looked upon in a positive light by U.S. government regulators.

Before Covid-19, I’m not sure many people thought telehealth or virtual medicine would become an everyday norm for Americans. Post-Covid, I’m sure many patients will go back to in-person visits with their primary healthcare provider.

On the surface, this suggests that Teladoc’s revenues could be at risk. That said, I’m confident that Teladoc has built this reality into its business model.

Recently, Teladoc announced it would acquire Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) in an all-stock transaction worth $18.5 billion. Teladoc shareholders will own 58% of the merged company and Livongo Health shareholders the rest.

My InvestorPlace colleague Matt McCall recently reminded investors that mergers don’t always work out so well. Matt, you’re preaching to the choir here.

On July 9, I recommended that investors consider Livongo Health’s stock because it would stay hot for years to come:

“With an asset-light business model, I find it hard to believe Livongo’s revenues are going to slow anytime soon. Further, it has more than enough cash to survive the novel coronavirus and anything else Mother Nature chooses to throw at the world. I see LVGO as the diamond-in-the-rough of the seven hot stocks on my list. It’s going to surprise a lot of people in the future.”

Well, 18.5 billion reasons later, the merger gives Teladoc a broader foundation upon which to grow its market-leading telehealth business. Long-term, Teladoc’s a winner.

Shopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade

This last pick probably seems at odds with reality. Covid-19 has decimated small business. And while it might be hard to imagine small businesses rebounding anytime soon, in my experience, these are some of the most resilient entrepreneurs around.

I’m not trying to downplay the facts. According to McKinsey and Co., small businesses were much less prepared for the economic shock of the pandemic, with approximately one-third operating at break-even or even at a loss pre-Covid.

This is where Shopify comes in.

It has the resources and know-how to get businesses rolling again. This technology platform’s reason for being is to help small businesses to be successful. If they win, Shopify wins.

In Canada, the company partnered with the Canadian government to launch Go Digital Canada, expressly set up to help small businesses go digital.

“From our perspective, small businesses, they are the backbone of the Canadian economy. They make up 98 percent of Canadian companies,” Sylvia Ng, general manager of Shopify’s Start product line, told BetaKit in July. “The fact that they’re faced with these unprecedented challenges due to COVID right now [made us want] to provide support to help bring these businesses online, and help future proof that backbone of the Canadian economy.”

Ditto for the U.S. I first recommended SHOP stock in May 2017 and I still recommend it today.

Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008. Publications where he’s appeared include InvestorPlace, The Motley Fool Canada, Investopedia, Kiplinger, and several others in both the U.S. and Canada. He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time. He lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

While there’s no denying its success, Zoom is a niche specialist. By contrast, Microsoft has several businesses that have benefited from Covid-19 — Teams, Cloud, Gaming and Windows — and should continue to outperform the competition in the months and years ahead.

Now Microsoft is teaming with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to buy TikTok’s U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand businesses. Estimates suggest the duo will have to pay anywhere from $20 to $30 billion for the short-form video application’s business in those countries.

While there are other bidders for TikTok, there’s no doubt that they’ll be looked upon in a positive light by U.S. government regulators.

Before Covid-19, I’m not sure many people thought telehealth or virtual medicine would become an everyday norm for Americans. Post-Covid, I’m sure many patients will go back to in-person visits with their primary healthcare provider.

On the surface, this suggests that Teladoc’s revenues could be at risk. That said, I’m confident that Teladoc has built this reality into its business model.

Recently, Teladoc announced it would acquire Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) in an all-stock transaction worth $18.5 billion. Teladoc shareholders will own 58% of the merged company and Livongo Health shareholders the rest.

My InvestorPlace colleague Matt McCall recently reminded investors that mergers don’t always work out so well. Matt, you’re preaching to the choir here.

On July 9, I recommended that investors consider Livongo Health’s stock because it would stay hot for years to come:

“With an asset-light business model, I find it hard to believe Livongo’s revenues are going to slow anytime soon. Further, it has more than enough cash to survive the novel coronavirus and anything else Mother Nature chooses to throw at the world. I see LVGO as the diamond-in-the-rough of the seven hot stocks on my list. It’s going to surprise a lot of people in the future.”

Well, 18.5 billion reasons later, the merger gives Teladoc a broader foundation upon which to grow its market-leading telehealth business. Long-term, Teladoc’s a winner.

This last pick probably seems at odds with reality. Covid-19 has decimated small business. And while it might be hard to imagine small businesses rebounding anytime soon, in my experience, these are some of the most resilient entrepreneurs around.

I’m not trying to downplay the facts. According to McKinsey and Co., small businesses were much less prepared for the economic shock of the pandemic, with approximately one-third operating at break-even or even at a loss pre-Covid.

This is where Shopify comes in.

It has the resources and know-how to get businesses rolling again. This technology platform’s reason for being is to help small businesses to be successful. If they win, Shopify wins.

In Canada, the company partnered with the Canadian government to launch Go Digital Canada, expressly set up to help small businesses go digital.

“From our perspective, small businesses, they are the backbone of the Canadian economy. They make up 98 percent of Canadian companies,” Sylvia Ng, general manager of Shopify’s Start product line, told BetaKit in July. “The fact that they’re faced with these unprecedented challenges due to COVID right now [made us want] to provide support to help bring these businesses online, and help future proof that backbone of the Canadian economy.”

Ditto for the U.S. I first recommended SHOP stock in May 2017 and I still recommend it today.

It may also make it a target.Aveva, based in Cambridge, England, makes software for industrial firms and specializes in tech that can take data from sensors in factories to predict malfunctions and find ways to improve output. As manufacturers have been pushed to upgrade technology to deal with more remote working and monitoring during the coronavirus lockdowns, that niche has fuelled growth.

Chief Financial Officer James Kidd said that he wants Aveva to continue to expand through deals, scooping up more of the small tech companies that have blossomed around this industry in recent years and incorporating them into an increasingly global enterprise.

Kidd and his colleagues already have experience with dealmaking: Aveva merged with French industrial giant Schneider Electric SE’s software business in 2018 in a transaction that left Schneider as its majority shareholder.

“We learned a lot through the Schneider-Aveva merger,” Kidd said in an interview. “It’s a playbook we could use again first and foremost. The sector is obviously consolidating and we want to play a major part in that.”

With a gross margin that beat Microsoft Corp.’s last fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and subscription revenue that grew 30% in the quarter ending in June, the company’s success could draw the attention of bigger rivals. The total addressable market for all types of industrial software makers is expected to grow more than 30% to over $56 billion by 2024 as more factories deploy digital tools, according to research from the ARC Advisory Group.

“It was in most companies’ three-to-five-year plan, then once the pandemic came, it really accelerated,” said Craig Resnick, vice president of consulting at ARC Advisory. “It’s really difficult to operate these plants remotely without having all the right tools -- not only to be able to monitor and visualize and control what goes on in the plant floor, but also to create digital models of some of the assets on the factory floor.”

Aveva is in a sweet spot having software development expertise and an intimate knowledge of the needs of industrial companies, Chief Executive Officer Craig Hayman said. Companies that don’t have both sets of skills find making this type of product much more difficult.

“It’s a little harder for some of the bigger software companies to do this,” said Julian Serafini, an analyst at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. “It doesn’t mean they won’t try, but Aveva is well-positioned from this angle of specialization.”

310,2020-08-28T20:37:52+00:00,'This is a liquidity driven rally': Zor Capital’s Joe Fahmy on why the market will head higher into the 2020 election,"Joe Fahmy, Zor Capital Managing Director, joined The Final Round to discuss the market rally, what's driving it, and his thoughts on how the 2020 election will impact the market.

Video Transcript

JEN ROGERS: Well, we've got a great Yahoo Finance lineup for everyone today-- Rick Newman, Akiko Fujita, Jared Blikre. But as Myles said, our friend of the program Joe Fahmy is here from Zor Capital. He's the managing director there, so let's bring him in, see what he has to say.

I mean, Joe, I was-- before we came up, I was trying to explain the market to a child. And I said something like, this market is crazy. And they're like, why? And I said, well, it's just really high, and everything else is going on. And they said, well, why can't it go higher? And I was like, I guess that's a really good question. I mean, it-- to people, it seems out of whack. Why is it not?

JOE FAHMY: I mean, you have to make adjustments to the conditions we're in, and this is a liquidity-driven rally where interest rates are low. The Fed is a huge factor along with it. I wrote an article for you guys a couple of weeks ago saying I think we're heading higher into the election because the Fed is one reason. There's very little professional selling. And the leaders are acting very, very well. There's a lot of positives to this market, but the main thing is the liquidity.

JEN ROGERS: OK, so why is it all about liquidity here? Is this-- is it a don't fight the Fed situation? We had Brian Cheung on last hour talking about the changes that the Fed has made, and he said that we could be here for eight to 10 years. Am I-- I mean, Myles, you were in the program, right? I got that right-- eight to 10 years that we could have--

MYLES UDLAND: I mean, that's what happened last time, right? I mean, so sure.

JEN ROGERS: It's-- that's a long time.

JOE FAHMY: I mean, the other thing a lot of people aren't talking about is that a lot of money managers are underperforming because they got it wrong earlier this year-- and I understand that-- and they discounted how much the Fed was really helping the markets. So what's-- when you talk about the narrow leadership that you alluded to earlier is that if these big managers that might need to put $100 million or $1 billion into the markets, they have a narrow universe of stocks that they can choose from.

Story continues

So what they will obviously chase with is the top NASDAQ-- you know, top 10, not even NASDAQ 100 stocks. We all know the names and the FANGs and the Microsofts and so forth. Because one, it's easy to get, as far as liquid, into those names. And two, they're companies with reliable earnings, so that is also what's driving the markets higher.

RICK NEWMAN: Hey, just-- Joe, just to go back to your idea that stocks could rise into the election, I-- number-- first of all, it seems to me, the markets have seemed to have decided they can live with Joe Biden. So it doesn't seem to be likely any kind of slump if Joe Biden really starts to surge ahead. But does that suggest there could be a dip after the election or sell-off?

JOE FAHMY: Yeah, that could be. I mean, there's a lot of variables. So you know, when I said, we're running higher into the election, a lot of people have asked me, well, what happens after that? I said, well, we'll worry about that when we get to it. But there's a lot of variables. If there's not a clear winner decided on election day, that could be uncertainty for the markets. I'm sure a lot of people will be hedged for either scenario. If Biden does win, there'll be a lot of hedging. So that could keep a floor to the markets.

But overall-- this isn't a political statement-- I think Trump is going to do everything in his power to get re-elected. That's just a commonsense statement. Anyone running for re-election wants to get re-elected. So whether it's keeping pressure on the Fed or some possible, you know, tax cuts, various stimulus, that's going to continue to keep the markets afloat, of course with dips along the way, but I think they're going to be shallow over the next couple months.

AKIKO FUJITA: So Joe, shouldn't that statement alone be considered a risk? If you're talking about the president doing whatever it takes to win, I mean, we've heard everything from him talking about approval for some kind of-- one of the vaccine candidates. We've seen-- I mean, there-- the trade issue with China. I mean, what we have seen over the last few months is the president willing to put pressure where he can if he knows that it's going to resonate coming into November.

JOE FAHMY: Yeah, that's a great question, and I'm only saying this because Trump is clearly running on an economic platform, especially talks a lot about, you know, one of the few presidents who has ever discussed the stock market so much. It can be a risk, but that's where people really need to understand whether they're long-term investors and they're probably sticking with it longer term or if they're shorter-term traders where they obviously have to manage their risk.

And I'm not saying, you know, OK, just the teacher's out of the classroom and, you know, just have fun. I'm just saying that it's a rare equity-friendly environment. Take advantage of it. But of course, you need to have-- you need to manage your risk around that in case-- the reasons that I've said for why it's going higher, in case any of those reasons change, such as the big institutions start to show signs of selling. But right now, they're not.

RICK NEWMAN: Joe, are we going to see at some point, like in our lifetimes, the stock market reconnecting to the real economy, or can this just go on indefinitely?

JOE FAHMY: I mean, that's a great question. At some point, there will be, you know, some profit taking or if the Fed hints that they are not raising rates, but you know, a change of tone from them. I mean, it's a great question. Obviously, it can't go on indefinitely. But it can go on.

One thing I've learned from doing this 21 years is moves in the stock market can go on much longer than we expect in both directions. So until I see any major warning signs, I'm sticking with the trend. But I mean, obviously, at some point, this will end with, you know, some sort of bigger correction. But there'll be warning signs, you know, in the markets before that happens.

MYLES UDLAND: And Joe, I don't know if you have a very strong view on this, but it seems that most people do, which is the idea of narrow leadership. And we saw-- you just mentioned earlier, the 10 names that are doing all the work. Obviously, I think that performance-chasing thesis is a big part of why those names are so relentlessly big. But I'm sure you hear from folks who say, you know, oh, well, financials don't get involved, this rally can't continue. But I mean, it just seems that everyone is fixated on that state of play, and I'm just not sure if it is such a requirement of a bull run that each sector have its turn at the front.

JOE FAHMY: I mean, there is a lot of sector Rotation I mean, my wise-guy answer to when they say the market's only going up on 10 stocks, I say, well, then just be in those 10 stocks. But that does work for people. But I am seeing some sector rotation. I am seeing some financials. They might not be participating big, but they're stabilizing.

There's definitely housing stocks that are acting well and a few other sectors outside of tech-- you know, the payments space, which is a sign of the economy opening back up. So I am seeing more than just those 10 stocks. If they're not screaming higher, that's OK, but at least they are participating somewhat.

RICK NEWMAN: Joe, you said before that if there is some kind of sustained sell-off, we will see signs that it is coming. What would those signs be? What should we be looking for?

JOE FAHMY: I mean, I like to watch the technicals of the market. I'll give you two really quick. If you start to see, you know, some big volume come into the market consistently, to see any major market top-- you know, I wrote about this in the article about a distribution day, meaning a big down day on heavy volume. To see any major market top, you need to see four or five or six of them in a short period of time. So that's one. And then from a technical point, just a simple 50-day moving average-- as long as the market's holding above that, for the most part, it's healthy. If we start to break below key moving averages from a technical point of view, that's when I would get more defensive and more cautious.

While the titans have their days in the sun, there are some very good smaller tech stocks to buy that are doing some incredible things that for most investors, are hidden in the mega-caps’ shadows.

30 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for 20 Years of Income Growth

The six below-the-radar tech everyone should, in my humble opinion, buy are below. They represent companies that are in the forefront of cutting-edge tech from 5G to renewable energy to animal healthcare to venture capital.

Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Telefon AB LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital (NYSE:HASI) TDK Corp (OTCMKTS:TTDKY) Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS)

These are similar to the unique opportunities InvestorPlace’s chief technology analyst Matt McCall studies for a living, only those are even farther under the radar.

Lesser Known Tech Stocks to Buy: Hercules Capital (HTGC) A hand lingers over a bright blue tech wheel that says ""fintech.""

This firm is structured as a business development company (BDC). Basically, BDCs are kind of like venture capital funds for individual investors. They were set up in 1980 to help investment in developing and distressed market sectors.

One of their big advantages is that by law they must pay out 90% of their profits to their investors, so dividends are usually higher than average. In the case of HTGC, its dividend is currently around 11.6%.

Story continues

While BDCs can invest in all manner of businesses, HTGC has focused on tech companies that are in the tech sector. Since it’s headquartered in Silicon Valley, that makes perfect sense.

HTGC buys into a company or provides financing. Since 2003, it has worked with more than 500 companies.

I consider HTGC an alternative financial firm (aka, alt-financial) since it provides an alternative way for small to mid-sized companies to access capital without going through a bank or traditional financing arrangement.

The goal is to provide financing and help with leadership of these firms and then as they grow, either help exit when the firm goes public or is sold to another firm. HTGC has a great track record. And investors get access to a portfolio of promising tech firms — life sciences, SaaS, renewables — in one stock.

HTGC has been hit during the novel coronavirus pandemic because there’s concern for its portfolio companies defaulting. However, those fears are passing and HTGC stock is making a comeback. Its dividend helps buy investors’ patience at this point.

BlackBerry (BB) black berry (BB) logo on a sign outside of a corporate building

You may remember this company for its signature full keyboard smartphones, back before the iPhone was even a thing.

Granted, that aspect of the business is gone — although the phones are still built under license by another firm again. But what was always a unique value proposition for the company was its underlying network security.

BB was a big hit with business people because it was so secure and reliable, wherever you were in the world.

And that piece of the business has carried on. Today, it’s one of the leading cybersecurity providers to the growing 5G and smart/autonomous vehicle sectors. Its secure networks are crucial for both industries and few firms have been doing it as well or as long as BB. And its patent library is huge and woefully undervalued.

Granted, at just $2.6 billion market cap, it’s a smaller more focused company that it used to be. But it’s growing. Just this week it announced a deal with Desay, a Chinese auto parts maker to create a controller for XPeng Motors, a leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the country.

For that reason, it continues to be one of the more interesting and lesser known tech stocks to buy today. But if you’re looking for a play on the future of mobile technology, Matt McCall has identified a company producing a product that will change the face of communication as we know it.

10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy for Growth and Value

Another name from the dotcom heyday, this company was best known to consumers as a leading mobile phone maker when the mobile revolution was in its early days.

But what consumers didn’t understand back then, and only a few more know today, is that ERIC is one of the world’s top 5G telecom equipment suppliers.

After it sold off its phones to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it stuck to what it had always done better than most — mobile network equipment. As people adopted mobile phones, building networks for an unknown demand can be a costly business.

But now that mobility is the lifeblood of consumer and commercial communications, the massive demand means there are massive opportunities going forward. Plus, ERIC is one of the few companies in the world that is a 5G leader that isn’t a Chinese company.

And that is a very big deal in the U.S. and many nations in Europe. India is also shying away from Chinese 5G.

That’s part of the reason why ERIC stock is up nearly 37% in the past year, but still maintains great price-to-sales (1.2x) and price-to-book (3.3x) valuations, even with a high price-to-earnings ratio.

Don’t forget that Ericsson has a nearly $40 billion market cap and it has been around since 1876. It’s a global force.

One of the biggest long-term investing trends that has begun in recent years is called Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) investing.

And while it sounds like its about butterflies and sunsets, it’s really about rethinking the way companies consider their impact on the world and the people who live in it.

Influential institutional investing houses are embracing it as are a growing list of businesses. The ESG principles are really about encouraging companies to modernize the way they do business and make their processes more efficient and transparent.

Much of this gets lost in the current mega-tech bull market, but this is a trend that Wall Street is fully backing. And it makes HASI stock one of those tech stocks to buy that investors are overlooking. That’s much like the kinds of forward-moving, trend-setting stocks McCall reports on.

HASI is a key beneficiary of the ESG movement since it’s fundamentally a real estate investment trust that owns and invests in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.

Furthermore, many of its projects are underwritten by federal and state governments, so its funding sources are very reliable. That’s a big deal in today’s uncertain environment.

7 Companies That Should Split Their Stocks

HASI stock has a $3 billion market cap and it also delivers a 3.2% dividend, which is impressive given that HASI is up 54% in the past 12 months.

Do you remember the golden age of cassette tapes? These were the soundtracks to the lives of most people in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s. For you younger readers, these were the CDs of their time.

But you really need to think of them as that generation’s data storage devices, since that’s what magnetic tape was all about, whether for businesses or consumers.

TDK was a leader. It was also a leader when tapes went out of style and CDs became the new wave of data storage. Then it sold off those assets and moved into capacitors and inductors for chips, and eventually into solid state data storage.

As you can see, while its name is a vintage brand, the company has remained at the cutting edge of technology.

Today, its power management and power supply products are the cornerstone of 5G technology. It also uses this technology for mobile phone and laptop batteries, as well as electric vehicles.

What’s more, at this point abut 90% of its business is outside Japan, so it is wired into the expanding tech markets around the globe.

TTDKY stock has a $13 billion market cap and provides a respectable 1.3% dividend. It’s up nearly 40% in the past year, but it’s still a value relative to other popular tech stocks.

In a world where animal-human diseases are growing as nature retreats to civilization, it’s comforting to know that ZTS is around. It’s one of the leading animal healthcare companies in the world.

If you recall last year about this time, the headlines were full of China’s massive problem with the African Swine Flu (ASF) in its pig population. When all was said and done, the country had to kill more than 40% of its pigs because of the disease.

That set considerable economic turmoil, given the fact that China is the leading consumer of pork in the world. More recently, you may recall the shortages in the U.S. of beef and chicken at times during the pandemic because the processing plants were shut down. Multiply that shortage by an order of magnitude and think about lasting months rather than weeks.

The point is, whether it’s livestock, large animals or our favorite pets, animal health is a big deal. And, it’s a big business. ZTS has a nearly $76 billion market cap.

Zoetis has been serving the animal healthcare market since the 1950s, and has global reputation at this point. For example, it was already developing an ASF vaccine when the pig pandemic hit. It also provides a wide variety of medicines, diagnostics and equipment for veterinarians and other animal health markets.

30 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for 20 Years of Income Growth

ZTS stock is up 26% in the past year and has a small 0.5% dividend. All its sectors are flashing green, making it one of the standout tech stocks to buy now.

Each of these tech stocks show promise, but I want to quickly bring your attention to another growth play. It’s bound for long-term success that’s perhaps even more impressive, only the space it focuses on is mobile communication.

These are the darlings of Wall Street at this point. They are not only stealing all the oxygen on the financial shows and publications, but they’re also getting all the money.

The S&P 500 has changed its weightings so that it can better take advantage of the massive move in tech, which is a self-fulling prophecy, since all the index fund managers that use the S&P 500 as their benchmark have to reallocate as well.

And now the Dow Jones Industrial Average has kicked out its longest-standing member — ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) — as well as others to make way for more tech.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

While the titans have their days in the sun, there are some very good smaller tech stocks to buy that are doing some incredible things that for most investors, are hidden in the mega-caps’ shadows.

30 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for 20 Years of Income Growth

The six below-the-radar tech everyone should, in my humble opinion, buy are below. They represent companies that are in the forefront of cutting-edge tech from 5G to renewable energy to animal healthcare to venture capital.

Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Telefon AB LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital (NYSE:HASI) TDK Corp (OTCMKTS:TTDKY) Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS)

These are similar to the unique opportunities InvestorPlace’s chief technology analyst Matt McCall studies for a living, only those are even farther under the radar.

This firm is structured as a business development company (BDC). Basically, BDCs are kind of like venture capital funds for individual investors. They were set up in 1980 to help investment in developing and distressed market sectors.

One of their big advantages is that by law they must pay out 90% of their profits to their investors, so dividends are usually higher than average. In the case of HTGC, its dividend is currently around 11.6%.

Story continues

While BDCs can invest in all manner of businesses, HTGC has focused on tech companies that are in the tech sector. Since it’s headquartered in Silicon Valley, that makes perfect sense.

HTGC buys into a company or provides financing. Since 2003, it has worked with more than 500 companies.

I consider HTGC an alternative financial firm (aka, alt-financial) since it provides an alternative way for small to mid-sized companies to access capital without going through a bank or traditional financing arrangement.

The goal is to provide financing and help with leadership of these firms and then as they grow, either help exit when the firm goes public or is sold to another firm. HTGC has a great track record. And investors get access to a portfolio of promising tech firms — life sciences, SaaS, renewables — in one stock.

HTGC has been hit during the novel coronavirus pandemic because there’s concern for its portfolio companies defaulting. However, those fears are passing and HTGC stock is making a comeback. Its dividend helps buy investors’ patience at this point.

BlackBerry (BB) black berry (BB) logo on a sign outside of a corporate building

You may remember this company for its signature full keyboard smartphones, back before the iPhone was even a thing.

Granted, that aspect of the business is gone — although the phones are still built under license by another firm again. But what was always a unique value proposition for the company was its underlying network security.

BB was a big hit with business people because it was so secure and reliable, wherever you were in the world.

And that piece of the business has carried on. Today, it’s one of the leading cybersecurity providers to the growing 5G and smart/autonomous vehicle sectors. Its secure networks are crucial for both industries and few firms have been doing it as well or as long as BB. And its patent library is huge and woefully undervalued.

Granted, at just $2.6 billion market cap, it’s a smaller more focused company that it used to be. But it’s growing. Just this week it announced a deal with Desay, a Chinese auto parts maker to create a controller for XPeng Motors, a leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the country.

For that reason, it continues to be one of the more interesting and lesser known tech stocks to buy today. But if you’re looking for a play on the future of mobile technology, Matt McCall has identified a company producing a product that will change the face of communication as we know it.

10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy for Growth and Value

BB stock is off year to date, but it has far less downside risk than it does upside opportunity at this point. Sales are up, and the stock is value bargain.

Another name from the dotcom heyday, this company was best known to consumers as a leading mobile phone maker when the mobile revolution was in its early days.

But what consumers didn’t understand back then, and only a few more know today, is that ERIC is one of the world’s top 5G telecom equipment suppliers.

After it sold off its phones to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it stuck to what it had always done better than most — mobile network equipment. As people adopted mobile phones, building networks for an unknown demand can be a costly business.

But now that mobility is the lifeblood of consumer and commercial communications, the massive demand means there are massive opportunities going forward. Plus, ERIC is one of the few companies in the world that is a 5G leader that isn’t a Chinese company.

And that is a very big deal in the U.S. and many nations in Europe. India is also shying away from Chinese 5G.

That’s part of the reason why ERIC stock is up nearly 37% in the past year, but still maintains great price-to-sales (1.2x) and price-to-book (3.3x) valuations, even with a high price-to-earnings ratio.

Don’t forget that Ericsson has a nearly $40 billion market cap and it has been around since 1876. It’s a global force.

One of the biggest long-term investing trends that has begun in recent years is called Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) investing.

And while it sounds like its about butterflies and sunsets, it’s really about rethinking the way companies consider their impact on the world and the people who live in it.

Influential institutional investing houses are embracing it as are a growing list of businesses. The ESG principles are really about encouraging companies to modernize the way they do business and make their processes more efficient and transparent.

Much of this gets lost in the current mega-tech bull market, but this is a trend that Wall Street is fully backing. And it makes HASI stock one of those tech stocks to buy that investors are overlooking. That’s much like the kinds of forward-moving, trend-setting stocks McCall reports on.

HASI is a key beneficiary of the ESG movement since it’s fundamentally a real estate investment trust that owns and invests in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.

Furthermore, many of its projects are underwritten by federal and state governments, so its funding sources are very reliable. That’s a big deal in today’s uncertain environment.

7 Companies That Should Split Their Stocks

HASI stock has a $3 billion market cap and it also delivers a 3.2% dividend, which is impressive given that HASI is up 54% in the past 12 months.

Do you remember the golden age of cassette tapes? These were the soundtracks to the lives of most people in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s. For you younger readers, these were the CDs of their time.

But you really need to think of them as that generation’s data storage devices, since that’s what magnetic tape was all about, whether for businesses or consumers.

TDK was a leader. It was also a leader when tapes went out of style and CDs became the new wave of data storage. Then it sold off those assets and moved into capacitors and inductors for chips, and eventually into solid state data storage.

As you can see, while its name is a vintage brand, the company has remained at the cutting edge of technology.

Today, its power management and power supply products are the cornerstone of 5G technology. It also uses this technology for mobile phone and laptop batteries, as well as electric vehicles.

What’s more, at this point abut 90% of its business is outside Japan, so it is wired into the expanding tech markets around the globe.

TTDKY stock has a $13 billion market cap and provides a respectable 1.3% dividend. It’s up nearly 40% in the past year, but it’s still a value relative to other popular tech stocks.

In a world where animal-human diseases are growing as nature retreats to civilization, it’s comforting to know that ZTS is around. It’s one of the leading animal healthcare companies in the world.

If you recall last year about this time, the headlines were full of China’s massive problem with the African Swine Flu (ASF) in its pig population. When all was said and done, the country had to kill more than 40% of its pigs because of the disease.

That set considerable economic turmoil, given the fact that China is the leading consumer of pork in the world. More recently, you may recall the shortages in the U.S. of beef and chicken at times during the pandemic because the processing plants were shut down. Multiply that shortage by an order of magnitude and think about lasting months rather than weeks.

The point is, whether it’s livestock, large animals or our favorite pets, animal health is a big deal. And, it’s a big business. ZTS has a nearly $76 billion market cap.

Zoetis has been serving the animal healthcare market since the 1950s, and has global reputation at this point. For example, it was already developing an ASF vaccine when the pig pandemic hit. It also provides a wide variety of medicines, diagnostics and equipment for veterinarians and other animal health markets.

30 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for 20 Years of Income Growth

ZTS stock is up 26% in the past year and has a small 0.5% dividend. All its sectors are flashing green, making it one of the standout tech stocks to buy now.

Each of these tech stocks show promise, but I want to quickly bring your attention to another growth play. It’s bound for long-term success that’s perhaps even more impressive, only the space it focuses on is mobile communication.

While several tech titans helped lay the foundation for our hyper-connected society, this company stands to lead a technological revolution that will forever change communication on a global scale.

313,2020-08-25T03:30:00+00:00,Nintendo Plans Upgraded Switch Console and Major Games for 2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. plans to debut an upgraded model of its Switch console next year along with a lineup of new games, people familiar with the matter said, ceding 2020’s holiday spotlight to rival devices from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.

The specifications of the new machine have yet to be finalized, though the Kyoto-based company has looked into including more computing power and 4K high-definition graphics, people briefed on the strategy told Bloomberg News, asking not to be identified because it’s private. Nintendo faces stiff competition for gamers’ attention this fall as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are set to arrive in time for the shopping season.

The release of the upgraded Switch would be coupled with, or followed by, a slew of games from Nintendo itself and related outside studios, the people said. Those games would address a wide range of players, from casual gamers seeking small doses of escapism to more devoted fans putting in marathon gaming sessions. The focus on next year’s pipeline explains Nintendo’s relatively quiet software release schedule so far this year, the people said.

The gaming giant has seen record-breaking hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the protracted Covid-19 pandemic spark a rally of more than 70% in its share price since the game’s release in March.

The company has struggled to keep up with demand for its existing Switch and Switch Lite, though it said earlier this month that its production bottleneck has largely been resolved. This has been helped by plunging smartphone demand releasing some of the pressure on suppliers. Assembly of Nintendo’s next console isn’t expected to begin until next year because production partners are busy with making the current models, according to the people informed.

Taiwan’s Economic Daily News first reported the new console plans on Monday. A Nintendo spokesman declined to comment.

The video game industry saw an unprecedented surge over the quarter ended June, with big names like Sony, Square Enix Holdings Co., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Nintendo itself far outperforming analyst expectations as the pandemic kept millions of people homebound for extended periods of time. Those companies have sounded a note of caution about the momentum continuing, though data from Japan-based research firm Famitsu suggests demand for the Switch and Animal Crossing remained strong in August.

Nintendo has sold 61 million Switch consoles in the period between its March 2017 launch and the end of June this year. Extending the console’s lifespan with a specced-up version is likely to make it the company’s longest-lived console generation.

“With Nintendo Switch about to begin its fourth year, the situation does feel a little different from the home consoles we’ve offered in the past,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said in January, when he added a note not to expect new hardware in 2020. “In terms of hardware, I think we will be able to consider a variety of ways to expand in the future.”

The Wii is Nintendo’s biggest home console hit to date with lifetime sales of 102 million units, while the portable Nintendo DS has reached 154 million units -- and at least one analyst expects a refreshed Switch model can boost sales enough to make it the company’s most successful hardware generation.

“The Switch will surpass the Wii’s sales even without an upgrade,” said Ace Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda. “And a sound hardware update plan would even allow the Switch to surpass the Nintendo DS handheld.”

315,2020-08-24T09:17:50+00:00,Nintendo Adds Another $3 Billion as Robinhood Traders Press Play,"(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. added another $3 billion in market value in Tokyo on Monday with retail investors on the Robinhood app cited as helping to further boost the game maker’s popularity.

Nintendo has been one the strongest-performing blue-chip stocks in Japan this year, as the pandemic, together with the release of its smash-hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons game, helped boost the already high popularity of its Switch console. Shares are up more than 70% from their March low, and have hardly looked back since passing the 50,000 yen barrier in June, with earnings earlier this month blowing past all estimates and Nintendo software continuing to dominate sales rankings in Japan.

The stock added another 4.8% on Monday, the biggest gain since March 19, with Daiwa Securities Co.’s Eiji Kinouchi citing the impact of the stock’s popularity with U.S. retail investors.

“As well as Nintendo, Robinhood users like Sony Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp. among Japanese shares, but both of those have connections to China,” Kinouchi said in an interview. “Nintendo is one of the easiest Japanese stock for Robinhood investors to buy into amid concerns over U.S.-China tensions.”

In an Aug. 5 report, using data from the now-discontinued Robintrack site, Kinouchi showed Nintendo was the second-most held Japanese stock among Robinhood users, after Sony and ahead of SoftBank.

Monday’s gains also followed a report in the Taipei-based Economic Daily News that Nintendo may launch a new version of its Switch console early next year, citing unidentified people in the supply chain. A more powerful version of the console has been rumored in the past.

Investors and gamers alike are still waiting for Nintendo to reveal its slate of games for the rest of the year, with only Pikmin 3 Deluxe, a remake of a seven-year-old Wii U title, set for release in 2020. David Gibson, chief investment adviser at Astris Advisory Japan, said in a tweet last week that he hoped the company would hold one of its “Nintendo Direct” online presentations to announce new titles before a management briefing scheduled for September 16th.

Story continues

The curiously bare game pipeline comes even as Sony and Microsoft prepare to spend big on their new generations of PlayStation and Xbox consoles being released this holiday season.

But for Ace Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda, who raised his price target for Nintendo by 6.6% to 67,400 yen, the impact of the rival releases on the popularity of the Switch will be limited.

“Even with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, sales of Switch will remain strong,” he wrote in a report published Aug. 21. “We believe that sales of game consoles are determined by their design and style, and the advantage of Switch, which can be played by anyone at any time anywhere, will not change.”

Yasuda is predicting a minimum if 23 million Switch units sold this year, well above Nintendo’s own forecast of 19 million.

An index fund, also known as exchange-traded fund (ETF), is a basket of securities — some combination of stocks, bonds and commodities. Many of these funds track various indices and help investors diversify their portfolio holdings.

Over the past three decades, index funds have become some of the most popular passive investment vehicles among retail and professional investors. Low transaction costs and intraday liquidity are among the biggest benefits for investors. And even in these uncertain times, new investors are wading into the stock market.

“Beginning investors need to keep in mind that the opportunity to enter the financial markets is based on institutional and regulatory protections, as well as the need to time the entry. The goal is to buy low, minimize fees and let long term diversified investments take care of market fluctuations. There is no need to invest large amounts. The key is to start small, strategically, and don’t wait until middle age.”

With all that background information, here are seven index funds for long-term portfolios:

The Direxion Work From Home ETF is one of the newest exchange traded funds on the market. It started trading on June 25, at an opening price of $50.08. On August 5, it notched an all-time high of $55.83.

It tracks the Solactive Remote Work Index, which comprises businesses offering technological infrastructure and services in four industries: cloud technologies, cybersecurity, remote communications, online project and document management.

The Solactive Remote Work Index consists of 40 companies, ten from each industry group. The top five holdings of the Direxion Work From Home ETF are Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Inseego (NASDAQ:INSG), Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Avaya (NYSE:AVYA) and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA). These make up approximately 18% of the total value of the fund.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered structural shifts in the way people, worldwide, are now living their lives. 2020 is quickly becoming the year of  ‘home sweet home’ for many.

Thematic investing may enable market participants to diversify their portfolios while capturing trends such as stay-at-home and work-from-home. And this index fund may act as a basis for further research.

As always, investors should consider individual investment goals along with risks/return profiles and charges/expenses of each fund, such as WFH.

Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (PDBC)

52-week range: $11.08-$16.91 Dividend Yield: 1.68% Expense Ratio: 0.61% per year, or $61 on a $10,000 investment. a bunch of oil barrels are stacked high

The Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF invests in commodity-linked futures and other financial instruments that provide access to a diverse group of commodities.

PDBC aims to provide a long-term capital appreciation strategy that surpasses the performance of DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return, an index composed of futures contracts on 14 commodities across energy, precious metals, industrial metals and agriculture.

Gold, Gasoline, Crude Crude and Brent Crude futures have the highest weightings, comprising close to 45% of the funds. Wheat, Sugar, Soybeans and Corn make up 25.61% of the fund, while Copper, Aluminum and Zinc compose 13.93% of the ETF. Other holdings include NY Harbor ULSD, Natural Gas and Silver.

Year-to-date, the fund is down over 16%. Commodity prices are mostly dependent on supply and demand. For example, during a cold winter, as the demand for natural gas increases, so do prices. Commodity prices also typically move higher during inflationary periods, as they are widely considered a hedge against inflation.

Historically, there has been a negative correlation between commodities and stocks. Academic research shows that by investing in commodity futures or ETFs based on these contracts, market participants may be able to decrease the volatility of an all-stock portfolio without reducing their expected return.

Thus investors trying to diversify into commodities should consider this index fund further.

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB)

52-week range: $92.15-$146.53 Dividend Yield: 0.29% Expense Ratio: 0.47% per year, or $47 on a $10,000 investment floating molecules representing biotech stocks like SRNE stock

Source: Shutterstock

Launched in 2001, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF is one of the largest ETFs, and it’s run by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager.

The fund tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, comprised of NASDAQ-listed companies classified as either biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies that meet additional criteria.

IBB’s five largest holdings are Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). These five make up around 35% of the fund, which invests in a total of 212 companies.

Year-to-date, IBB is up over 12%. In fact, on July 20, it hit a new all-time high. Given the recent increases in prices of individual shares, there may be some short-term profit-taking around the corner. A decline toward the $125 level is likely, which would provide potential IBB investors with a better entry point.

Within the biopharma industry, IBB could be appropriate for a wide range of long-term buy-and-hold investors with a high tolerance for short-term market fluctuations.

iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)

52-week range: $95.69-$170.56 Dividend Yield: 1.3% Expense Ratio: 0.19% per year, or $19 on a $10,000 investment. a ticker board that says ""SMALL CAP"" among various ticker increases

Small-cap stocks can boost portfolio diversification and increase potential returns over time. For those looking to invest in U.S.-listed small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF may be a strong candidate.

IWM tracks the Russell 2000 and covers practically all industries. Late-stage biotech Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), in-home healthcare provider LHC Group (NASDAQ:LHCG), footwear corporation Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), global consumer product company Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) and BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) are among the top big name holdings.

6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now

Year-to-date, IWM is down about 6%. Put another way, in recent weeks, small-caps have been lagging large-caps. Over the long-run, small-cap stocks and small-cap index funds often outperform their large-cap counterparts. However, they are typically more volatile.

SPDR S&P 500ETF (SPY)

52-week range: $218.26-$339.10 Dividend Yield: 1.69% Expense Ratio: 0.04% per year, or $4 on a $10,000 investment. Street sign for Wall Street pictured in front of several American flags representing american stocks

Source: Shutterstock

The S&P 500 measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies in the US. These companies make up around 80% of the overall US stock market’s value and cover approximately 24 separate industry groups. The capitalization-weighted SPDR S&P 500 ETF follows this index.

For many investors, the S&P’s performance shows how U.S. equities are performing in general. The “Spider” index is one of the most widely followed equity benchmarks in the world.

The SPY index fund value proposition is simple: Investors gain exposure to the growth and profitability of U.S.-based businesses without having to rely too heavily on any individual company’s performance.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (FEZ)

52-Week Range: $24.29 – 41.27 Dividend Yield: 1.59% Expense Ratio: 0.29% per year, or $29 on a $10,000 investment the European Union flag, a circle of gold stars on a navy blue background

The SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF, which has 50 holdings, follows the Euro Stoxx 50Index. While broader U.S. indices are likely to keep offering plenty of robust stocks, long-term investors may consider diversifying with shares of established companies listed in Europe, too.

The biggest sectors by weighting are Financials (14.08%), Information Technology (13.76%), Consumer Discretionary (13.66%), Industrials (12.42%) and Materials (10.81%). These five sectors account for 65% of the fund.

The total net assets stand at around $1.7 billion and the top ten holdings make up 42% of the fund. FEZ’s top five companies are SAP (NYSE:SAP), ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), Linde (NYSE:LIN), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC:LVMUY). In terms of geography, Eurozone members France, Germany and the Netherlands have the highest contribution, totaling close to 80%.

So far in the year, the fund is down close to 6%. However, it’s up over 50% from its lows of March.

In recent weeks, the economic data out of Europe hasn’t been much to write home about. However, the European Central Bank has announced a large stimulus package that will likely support the economy as well as share prices of solid European businesses.

The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF offers low-cost access to a broad basket of shares under one umbrella.

VTI, which tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, holds 3531 stocks covering all sectors and capitalizations, from mega- to micro-, in U.S. equity markets. Technology tops the list with a weighting of 26.4%, followed by Financials (16.3%), Consumer Services (14.2%) and Health Care (14.0%).

The fund’s top 3 holdings include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The top ten stocks make up close to a quarter of the fund.

Year-to-date, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is up 5.1%. However, that metric excludes the dividend yield of 1.69%. Research shows that investors who purchase dividend stocks and reinvest the dividends to buy more shares are likely to see considerable growth in their savings.

318,2020-08-21T12:27:02+00:00,9 Top Stocks to Buy for a Weakened Dollar,"At first glance, investors have reason for optimism regarding the nightmare that is the novel coronavirus. First, new daily infections appear to be declining significantly. Just as importantly, major economic data — such as the national unemployment rate — have surprisingly ticked lower. This may lull us into complacency when it comes to selecting top stocks to buy.

However, investors should remain vigilant for paradigm-shifting developments. While I don’t think these forward events are necessarily all doom and gloom, they will probably be enough to warrant serious strategy changes. Whatever were the top stocks to buy prior to this pandemic may not play out so profitably in the new normal.

Specifically, the Federal Reserve has little choice but to adopt a dovish monetary policy. Yes, unemployment is down. But the number of permanent job losses remains uncomfortably elevated. If we don’t get relief soon, many small businesses could wind up closing their doors forever.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

This isn’t an empty threat. Earlier in this pandemic, economic experts estimated that more than 100,000 small businesses had already permanently closed. With Congress deciding it’s more important to go on vacation than to help the American people, we could see substantial turmoil ahead. Therefore, the Fed will adopt an accommodative stance, which may benefit these top stocks to buy:

Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) Ford (NYSE:F) Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) 3M (NYSE:MMM) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

Finally, we’re not quite out of the woods with the coronavirus. Yes, cases are down, but medical experts warn that mass-scale testing has also declined. Sadly, this begs for an even greater wave to hit us in the winter, resulting in deeper economic pain. At least with these hot stocks to gain off dollar weakness, you won’t be caught off guard.

Top Stocks: Newmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont (NEM) logo on a mobile phone screen

If the greenback goes on a weakening spree, there’s one asset that shines above the rest. Of course, I’m talking about gold. As a safe haven, gold provides confidence as the universal store of value. However, physical precious metals can be cumbersome, to say the least. Therefore, investors may want to consider blue-chip mining companies like Newmont Corporation.

According to its website, Newmont “has the largest gold reserve base in the industry.” With gold prices moving higher based off economic uncertainty and social unrest, NEM stock is in an enviable position. In addition, Newmont generated nearly $2.4 billion in the quarter ended June 30, up almost 5% against the year-ago quarter.

I expect shares to represent one of the top stocks to buy for the rest of this year and over the next several years. No matter who is put in charge come November, the next presidential administration will have a doggedly difficult journey. Under these conditions, physical gold is your best bet in my opinion. Next to that are shares of NEM stock.

While gold is an obvious play if the U.S. dollar weakens, you shouldn’t ignore other precious metals – they’re called precious for a reason. For this simple fact, investors should consider adding Sibanye Stillwater to their list of top stocks to buy.

Sibanye offers a trifecta of bullishness for metals bugs, as the company is the “world’s largest primary producer of platinum, the second largest primary producer of palladium and the third largest producer of gold (on a gold-equivalent basis)…” Of these, I’m particularly interested in palladium and platinum.

For one thing, palladium is incredibly rare. Useful as an automotive catalyst, we may see a shift from industrial to monetary demand. With a price tag of over $2,200 at time of writing, palladium is still the most expensive precious metal among the four major ones. However, with Russia owning most of the palladium supply, SBSW stock is well positioned thanks to Sibanye’s more favorable location in South Africa.

Second, platinum is no slouch either in the rarity department. But the metal also has significant demand from industrial and medical industries. These sectors will be relevant no matter what the state of the global economy, potentially insulating SBSW stock.

Top Stocks: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it

While precious metals clearly have significant upside in a weakened dollar environment, don’t ignore other vital commodities. Over the last several years, lithium has gained significant attention due to its use as a power source for advanced electrical technologies. And among the top stocks in this sector is Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile.

Currently, SQM stock enjoys two longer-term tailwinds. First, the present economic malaise almost guarantees a dovish, accommodative policy. That translates to an inflationary setup for the U.S. dollar, which is positive for commodities. Second, the electric vehicle revolution means lithium will only rise in demand. Indeed, with so many EV competitors out there, it’s difficult to know which one will be the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

With SQM stock, you don’t have to play any guessing games. They all need lithium.

Further, Sociedad enjoys advantages over other lithium miners because of its geopolitically favorable geography. For the most part, we’re on good terms with Chile. Therefore, you should keep SQM on your list of top stocks to buy now and for the foreseeable future.

Ford (F) A Ford (F) sign hangs on a glass wall in Kiev, Ukraine.

For decades Ford has suffered a perception problem. Though the iconic automaker has made a push recently to improve reliability and quality, it’s hard to magically erase a culture of mediocrity. Don’t get me wrong — I know people who swear by Ford’s modern cars. But the ghosts of the past have haunted the company and by extension, F stock.

But with Ford’s pivot to electric vehicles, specifically its Mustang Mach-E SUV, I believe the company has the chance to make things right. So much so that I went ahead and bought some F stock on the cheap. Although I don’t like American cars at all, I recognize the potential upside.

First, with EVs, they are inherently more reliable than combustion-engine cars because of fewer moving parts. So, throw the reliability stigma out the window. Second, Tesla overwhelmingly dominates the EV market. But people eventually want variety — we couldn’t imagine a world where only one manufacturer produces combustion cars.

To this end, I think the Mach-E is very attractive. And I wouldn’t worry about criticisms that Ford is doing away with its classic two-door pony cars. Nobody buys those things anymore.

Finally, a weakened dollar makes our exports more attractive to foreign buyers. This generation’s Ford should finally capture the magic abroad.

Top Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT) A Caterpillar backhoe

Amid the drama of this pandemic, it’s easy to forget about “boring” names like Caterpillar. While it may not generate headlines during this period, CAT stock has been a high-flier since its March doldrums. Should the dollar weaken considerably from here on out, I expect Caterpillar to maintain its position as one of the top stocks to buy.

Historically, Caterpillar has performed relatively well when the Federal Reserve has implemented dovish monetary policies. When the greenback is weaker against other major currencies, American exports are comparatively cheaper. And for CAT stock, this is brilliant news as the underlying company generates more than half its sales from international markets.

Should President Donald Trump win reelection, this would be an even bigger signal to trust Caterpillar. In the historic 2016 presidential campaign, Trump routinely talked up the industrial equipment manufacturer. Either way, whoever wins the White House must start rebuilding the economy, which should be a positive for CAT.

3M (MMM) 3M (MMM) logo on top of a corporate building

In previous years when we had a strong dollar, this negatively affected applied science and industrial firms like 3M. Logically, if the situation reverses, we should see some positive trading action for MMM stock. Of course, nothing is ever that cut and dry in the markets. However, it does provide one reason among several to consider 3M.

First, the rather ho-hum company suddenly surged to relevance because of the pandemic. When the virus first struck us, people panicked and hoarded N95 face masks. Perhaps this alone isn’t a good enough reason to buy MMM stock considering its other vulnerabilities. However, this crisis is unlike any other we’ve suffered in modern American history in that everyone has been impacted in some way.

This is not a lesson we’ll soon forget. Therefore, people may buy 3M-branded protective equipment, just in case.

Further, 3M products are popular overseas so this action could be repeated across several countries. And with a weaker dollar, that should add up to some hefty sales, making 3M one of the underappreciated top stocks to buy.

Top Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.

Logically, a weakened dollar translates to a favorable environment for American exporters. And one of the top stocks to buy in this space for reliability and consistency is Microsoft. Admittedly, it doesn’t quite have the cachet of other elite consumer electronic firms. However, that could be changing because of the pandemic.

As I’ve argued before, Microsoft products are very practical. And that comes into play significantly in the workplace. With so many people forced to shift their operations remotely, Microsoft’s dominance in business applications should help lift MSFT stock. In addition, the company has a substantial presence globally. Therefore, with the greenback falling against other currencies, we could see a favorable impact.

Finally, I like MSFT stock for its strong position in video games. As you probably know, the company is scheduled to release its latest Xbox console for the holiday season this year. Though competition is very stiff in this arena, Microsoft more than holds its own. Combined with its myriad other businesses, such as cloud computing and hardware, you’ll want to keep close tabs on MSFT.

A longstanding American medical equipment company, Becton Dickinson offers pertinent exposure to the broader healthcare market. Unfortunately, the novel coronavirus took some of the shine off BDX stock, with investors piling into biotechnology firms as a speculative bet on a vaccine. Still, once some of that corona-fever fades out, Becton Dickinson should swing higher.

For starters, the company has enjoyed significant growth in the past three years over its core businesses of medication delivery solutions, medication management, pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care.

Second, Becton Dickinson generates approximately 43% of its revenue from international markets. In prior years when the U.S. dollar was rising against other currencies, the company incurred negative exchange rate impacts. As well, BDX stock has been flat in at least some of those years featuring currency headwinds.

Intriguingly, though, BDX shares jumped substantially higher in 2017 when the U.S. dollar index plummeted. If the greenback continues its bearish trend — and especially if Trump wins reelection — BDX could be one of the surprising top stocks in the healthcare space.

Top Stocks: Intel (INTC) The Intel (INTC) logo in blue on a black screen.

Want to go a little crazy? If underlying economic conditions continue to drive the greenback down, you should consider throwing some speculative money at Intel. Of course, INTC stock has suffered all kinds of volatility following Intel’s disclosure of delays to its next-generation chips until 2022. That was a huge disaster, which subsequently saw Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jump to record highs.

Given the catastrophe to its longtime rival, this is a massive opportunity for AMD. However, one also has to wonder about its equity performance potential from here on out. For those seeking an undervalued opportunity, INTC stock seems a not unreasonable bet.

For instance, while the fallout has been ugly for Intel, INTC shares have bounced off a support level that’s been in place since late 2017. If the situation was truly untenable for Intel, you’d expect a much steeper selloff.

Also, the company has a renowned brand and significant market share across relevant tech sectors. It may take more than a production delay — no matter how significant — to take down this beast.

A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare. As of this writing, he is long gold and F stock.

Either way, whoever wins the White House must start rebuilding the economy, which should be a positive for CAT.

In previous years when we had a strong dollar, this negatively affected applied science and industrial firms like 3M. Logically, if the situation reverses, we should see some positive trading action for MMM stock. Of course, nothing is ever that cut and dry in the markets. However, it does provide one reason among several to consider 3M.

First, the rather ho-hum company suddenly surged to relevance because of the pandemic. When the virus first struck us, people panicked and hoarded N95 face masks. Perhaps this alone isn’t a good enough reason to buy MMM stock considering its other vulnerabilities. However, this crisis is unlike any other we’ve suffered in modern American history in that everyone has been impacted in some way.

This is not a lesson we’ll soon forget. Therefore, people may buy 3M-branded protective equipment, just in case.

Further, 3M products are popular overseas so this action could be repeated across several countries. And with a weaker dollar, that should add up to some hefty sales, making 3M one of the underappreciated top stocks to buy.

Top Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft (MSFT) logo above the entrance.

Logically, a weakened dollar translates to a favorable environment for American exporters. And one of the top stocks to buy in this space for reliability and consistency is Microsoft. Admittedly, it doesn’t quite have the cachet of other elite consumer electronic firms. However, that could be changing because of the pandemic.

As I’ve argued before, Microsoft products are very practical. And that comes into play significantly in the workplace. With so many people forced to shift their operations remotely, Microsoft’s dominance in business applications should help lift MSFT stock. In addition, the company has a substantial presence globally. Therefore, with the greenback falling against other currencies, we could see a favorable impact.

Finally, I like MSFT stock for its strong position in video games. As you probably know, the company is scheduled to release its latest Xbox console for the holiday season this year. Though competition is very stiff in this arena, Microsoft more than holds its own. Combined with its myriad other businesses, such as cloud computing and hardware, you’ll want to keep close tabs on MSFT.

A longstanding American medical equipment company, Becton Dickinson offers pertinent exposure to the broader healthcare market. Unfortunately, the novel coronavirus took some of the shine off BDX stock, with investors piling into biotechnology firms as a speculative bet on a vaccine. Still, once some of that corona-fever fades out, Becton Dickinson should swing higher.

For starters, the company has enjoyed significant growth in the past three years over its core businesses of medication delivery solutions, medication management, pharmaceutical systems and diabetes care.

Second, Becton Dickinson generates approximately 43% of its revenue from international markets. In prior years when the U.S. dollar was rising against other currencies, the company incurred negative exchange rate impacts. As well, BDX stock has been flat in at least some of those years featuring currency headwinds.

Intriguingly, though, BDX shares jumped substantially higher in 2017 when the U.S. dollar index plummeted. If the greenback continues its bearish trend — and especially if Trump wins reelection — BDX could be one of the surprising top stocks in the healthcare space.

Top Stocks: Intel (INTC) The Intel (INTC) logo in blue on a black screen.

Want to go a little crazy? If underlying economic conditions continue to drive the greenback down, you should consider throwing some speculative money at Intel. Of course, INTC stock has suffered all kinds of volatility following Intel’s disclosure of delays to its next-generation chips until 2022. That was a huge disaster, which subsequently saw Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jump to record highs.

Given the catastrophe to its longtime rival, this is a massive opportunity for AMD. However, one also has to wonder about its equity performance potential from here on out. For those seeking an undervalued opportunity, INTC stock seems a not unreasonable bet.

For instance, while the fallout has been ugly for Intel, INTC shares have bounced off a support level that’s been in place since late 2017. If the situation was truly untenable for Intel, you’d expect a much steeper selloff.

Also, the company has a renowned brand and significant market share across relevant tech sectors. It may take more than a production delay — no matter how significant — to take down this beast.

The most popular stock among hedge funds last quarter was Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), according to 13F filings. This is based on the total number of funds buying a stock, not the net buys or net change in allocated capital.

Some big names were buying the social network in the second quarter. Tech-focused hedge funds and growth-focused funds were the biggest buyers, although there were also surprises in the data.

FB 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of FB Peter Lynch Chart of FB

Pat Dorsey's Dorsey Asset Management bought shares. The hedge fund increased its position by 6% overall. It now makes up just under 24% of the hedge fund's portfolio. However, it is a relatively small position compared to other firms at 640,000 shares.

Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, for example, owns a total of 5.3 million shares. Lone Pine was also buying during the second quarter. The fund increased its position by 49%. As a result, Facebook is now the fifth-largest position in the $20 billion hedge fund.

Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio)'s Maverick Capital, another tech-focused hedge fund giant, bought several hundred thousand more shares in Facebook during the quarter. It now owns just under 1.7 million shares, making it the largest holding in the $5 billion hedge fund.

Wells Fargo

The next most bought stock was Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). This company was popular with value investors, although some other big names did add to their holdings.

For example, Maverick Capital increased its position by 750%, although even after this gain, the holding is still less than 0.1% of the overall portfolio.

David Tepper (Trades, Portfolio)'s Appaloosa Management added to its holding, taking the position up to 1.9 million shares or 0.8% of his fund's portfolio.

Dodge & Cox was the largest buyer. The fund manager boosted its position by 14% to 63 million shares in the struggling banking giant.

Others

Other top buys by hedge funds during the quarter include Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Madison Square Garden Ent. Corp. (NYSE:MSGE) was bought by five big hedge funds during the quarter. Most of these positions were relatively small compared to the overall portfolio. Howard Marks (Trades, Portfolio)'s Oaktree Capital Management was a buyer. The firm acquired 30,000 shares in the entertainment business during the three months to the end of June, giving the position a 0.06% portfolio weight. Prem Watsa (Trades, Portfolio)'s Fairfax Financial Holdings also decided to take a position of 8,000 shares, giving it a 0.04% portfolio weight.

Another firm that was popular with hedge funds during the second quarter was the newly-merged defense group, Raytheon Technologies Corp. (NYSE:RTX). The biggest name buying the company was Chris Hohn's TCI Fund. The $25 billion hedge fund group acquired a position worth nearly $700 million during the quarter, giving it a 2.8% portfolio weight. Daniel Loeb (Trades, Portfolio)'s Third Point, which already owned a significant stake in the defense contractor before the beginning of the second quarter, increased its holding by 31%. Following this deal, Raytheon Technologies is now a top 10 position in Loeb's fund.

322,2020-08-13T15:10:25+00:00,"U.S. federal contract ban takes effect for companies using products from Huawei, others","By David Shepardson and Mike Stone

WASHINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - New regulations took effect on Thursday barring the U.S. government from buying goods or services from any company that uses products from five Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies, Hikvision and Dahua, a U.S. official said.

The rule, which was prompted by a 2019 law, could have far-ranging implications for companies that sell goods and services to the U.S. government, since they will now need to certify they do not use products from Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd or Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, even though both are among the top sellers of surveillance equipment and cameras worldwide.

The same goes for two-way radios from Hytera Communications Corp Ltd and telecommunications equipment or mobile devices like smartphones from Huawei Technologies Co or ZTE Corp.

Reuters first reported in July that the rule would take effect Aug. 13.

Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, said Thursday the Defense Department ""fully supports"" the intent of the changes ""but recognizes the implementation challenges facing industry partners.""

Her staff was working with Congress to help ""draft revisions to (the law) to facilitate effective implementation and to preclude untended consequences,"" Lord said.

Any company using equipment or services in day-to-day operations from these five companies will no longer be able to sell to the U.S. government without obtaining a government waiver.

The U.S. government annually awards more than $500 billion in contracts, according to the Government Accountability Office.

Last year, the United States placed Huawei, Hikvision and other firms on its economic blacklist, barring the firms from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval. The U.S. added the Chinese firms after concluding they were engaged in activities contrary to the interests of U.S. national security or foreign policy.

Story continues

The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) noted Thursday the regulations were only published a month ago even though the law requiring the changes was passed in 2019.

Top-Down Analysis

We don’t live in a world where individual stocks rise and fall on their own merits alone. They are, to one degree or another, influenced by the undercurrent of broad market trends and sector shifts. A good company in an out-of-favor sector gets penalized. Its wings are clipped by soured sentiment, limiting its ability to fly. Alternatively, a weak company in a favored sector receives a tailwind. It’s not a blessing born of good behavior. It’s a byproduct of being in the right place at the right time.

This reality is why traders should always keep an eye on the tone and trends of the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and other major indices.

The same goes for keeping tabs on sector performance. Knowing what is leading or lagging can be a huge time saver in discovering profitable opportunities as you explore the vast tundra of tickers.

The above explanation highlights the essence of top-down analysis. Moving from index to sector to stock allows for more informed decision-making and, ultimately, a higher success rate with your stock picking.

Enter NVDA Stock

The fast-growing company sits in the semiconductor industry of the technology sector. And both are on fire. With Thursday marking yet another record high, the Nasdaq Composite has now risen 67% off the March low. The epic magnitude of the rise has been matched by its consistency.

There is no denying mega-cap stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have done the heavy lifting, but the semiconductor industry has also been a growth engine for tech. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) has risen 79% from the March bottom.

After Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia is the second-largest holding. NVDA stock hasn’t been a backseat passenger during the now five-month trip. It has been driving the bus. Compared to the Nasdaq’s 67% gain, and the semiconductor industry’s rise of 79%, Nvidia has climbed 153% since March. Semiconductor ETF (SMH) chart showing bullish trend

In conclusion, we have a leading stock in a leading industry in the leading sector. That’s about as bullish a combination as you’ll find in the field of technical analysis.

Beware the Asymmetric Risk vs. Reward Nvidia (NVDA) stock chart showing overbought conditions

Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade

NVDA stock is working on its eighth up day in a row. Like all momentum feedback loops, it seems the higher the stock goes, the stronger it looks. But here’s where my inner risk radar starts going off. I’m not a fan of buying something that has already risen eight days in a row. The risk/reward ratio is out of whack, where the downside starts to outweigh the remaining upside. Tack on the looming earnings report on August 19 and buyers are running out of time if they want to enter and exit a trade before the next binary event strikes.

You have two choices.

First, sit on the sidelines and wait for a better setup to form. Nvidia has developed many pullbacks along the way after reaching short-term overbought conditions. There’s no reason we won’t see something similar this go around.

Second, if you want to jump on the momentum train and bet that the eight-day rally can extend itself to a ninth, tenth or eleventh session, then at least use a tight stop so when the inevitable retracement arrives you don’t ride it back down.

Through the partnership, Nonvoice will accelerate the adoption and success of its network of 5G app developers.

Nonvoice is the world’s first agency to focus on the opportunities for 5G apps, establishing new distribution channels and investment sources for innovative apps by providing access to its distribution network spanning North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe, while making use of connections with tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.

Bango Marketplace accelerates app developer revenue growth by enabling them to focus their marketing on new users proven to make in-app purchases, and on new users that pay for similar apps.

Launching an app by marketing into an audience of users that is proven to pay for similar apps is typically nine times more effective in getting subscriptions or in-app payments compared with conventional ""spray and pray"" demographic-only marketing. By selecting audiences from Bango Marketplace, Nonvoice can ensure that innovative apps get a faster return on marketing, giving a faster return on investment and bringing the benefits of 5G to a broader range of users.

Nonvoice will be working with the Bango Marketplace data scientists to identify new paying user segments that are optimized to the most advanced and innovative premium apps. Bango expects to develop and test special purpose ""5G audiences"" by using Nonvoice’s expertise and data, and some of these will be made generally available through Bango Marketplace.

Nonvoice CEO Simon Buckingham commented: ""Partnering with Bango to use this innovative way to increase the number of people who can enjoy the full experience of leading revenue generating 5G apps is an exciting opportunity. We are always eager to improve the return on marketing investment for our clients. Focussing marketing using Bango Audiences has shown up to a nine fold increase in conversion to payment and we can share our expertise more widely through Bango Marketplace.""

Story continues

Ray Anderson, Exec Chair at Bango commented: ""We welcome Nonvoice as a partner in our recently established Bango Marketplace Partner Program and look forward to working with them to support the ambitious growth objectives of their clients. Our data shows that users with 5G handsets and connectivity generate a higher average revenue per user (ARPU) than a general consumer. By focussing on the highest spenders, app launches generate their first revenues faster, making further investment both easier to obtain and higher yield""

326,2020-08-04T06:41:20+00:00,Australia shares rise most in two weeks on Wall Street rally,"(Updates to close)

By Soumyajit Saha

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose on Tuesday by their most in two weeks, as a tech-led overnight rally on Wall Street and upbeat U.S. data helped investors look past dour domestic retail sales print and a central bank prediction the economic recovery would be bumpy.

The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 1.88% higher at 6,037.6, with technology, energy and financials stocks leading the charge.

Overnight, the three major U.S. indexes gained between 0.7% and 1.5% as signs of a rebound in multibillion-dollar deals bolstered risk sentiment.

Adding to investor confidence, an industry gauge indicated U.S. manufacturing activity expanded in July at the fastest pace in more than a year.

""The strong data from the U.S. following positive Chinese data earlier on Monday reaffirmed that the global economic recovery was still in place,"" said Kyle Rodda, market analyst for IG Australia.

A private business survey showed China's factory activity expand at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in July.

By Soumyajit Saha

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose on Tuesday by their most in two weeks, as a tech-led overnight rally on Wall Street and upbeat U.S. data helped investors look past dour domestic retail sales print and a central bank prediction the economic recovery would be bumpy.

The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 1.88% higher at 6,037.6, with technology, energy and financials stocks leading the charge.

Overnight, the three major U.S. indexes gained between 0.7% and 1.5% as signs of a rebound in multibillion-dollar deals bolstered risk sentiment.

Adding to investor confidence, an industry gauge indicated U.S. manufacturing activity expanded in July at the fastest pace in more than a year.

""The strong data from the U.S. following positive Chinese data earlier on Monday reaffirmed that the global economic recovery was still in place,"" said Kyle Rodda, market analyst for IG Australia.

A private business survey showed China's factory activity expand at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in July.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia left its cash rate at a record low of 0.25% and predicted a bumpy road to economic recovery, as the country's second-largest state Victoria remained in a virus-led lockdown.

Data released earlier in the day showed domestic retail sales volumes suffered their biggest plunge in two decades in the second quarter.

By Arpit Nayak

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 2% on Tuesday to notch their best intraday session in two weeks after a tech-led overnight rally on Wall Street and strong manufacturing data from leading economies bolstered risk appetite.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at an all-time high overnight as U.S. tech giant Microsoft Corp's pursuit of Chinese-owned TikTok's U.S. operations lifted sentiment.

Investors also placed bets on further U.S. stimulus as Congressional Democrats and White House negotiators said they had made progress in discussions over a coronavirus relief bill.

The S&P/ASX 200 index was up 2% at 6,047 by 0056 GMT, marking its best session since July 21.

Back home, with the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to hold rates steady at a meeting later in the day, all eyes will be on its economic forecasts as the country witnesses a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.

Australia's second-largest city Melbourne on Monday announced fresh coronavirus-related restrictions on retail, manufacturing and administrative businesses, igniting fears of more job losses ahead.

Energy stocks gained on stronger oil prices as a string of positive manufacturing data from the United States, Europe and China indicated a factory recovery may be on the cards despite rising COVID-19 cases.

Woodside Petroleum gained 2.3%, while Santos rose 4.3%.

Solid gains for the ""Big Four"" Australian Banks lifted heavyweight financials up as much as 2.8%, their best session since July 21.

Tech stocks took a cue from their U.S. counterparts to climb up to 3.9%, with buy-now-pay-later firm Afterpay adding 5.9%.

Miners and healthcare stocks also rode a wave of optimism to book solid gains.

Only gold stocks traded in the red as the bullion weakened on positive U.S. economic data.

New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index climbed 0.9% to 11,776.41.

Local shares of lenders Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group rose 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively.

By Noel Randewich

Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq surged to a record high close on Monday as a rebound in multibillion-dollar deals, including Microsoft's pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations, lifted sentiment, and efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed.

Microsoft jumped 5.6% after it said it would push ahead with talks to buy the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok. President Donald Trump reversed course earlier on a planned ban of the short-video app.

ADT soared over 56% on news that Alphabet's Google was buying a nearly 7% stake in the home security firm for $450 million in a deal that will allow it to provide service to customers of its Nest home security devices.

Varian Medical Systems Inc jumped 22% after a $16 billion buyout by Germany's Siemens Healthineers, while Kansas City Southern gained after a report a group of buyout investors were considering a takeover bid in a deal of about $20 billion.

""The market is revolving around M&A activity possibly picking up,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""It means CEOs are more confident about the future. Otherwise, why would they lay out billions of dollars?""

Apple Inc climbed 2.5%, expanding its rally following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. The tech giant is about $140 billion short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.

The S&P 500 information technology index jumped 2.5%, far outpacing other sector indexes.

Congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials resumed talks aimed at hammering out a coronavirus relief bill after missing a vital deadline to extend relief benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans.

Story continues

A rally in tech-related stocks and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within about 3% of February's record high.

The Labor Department's monthly employment report is due on Friday, on the heels of last week's weekly jobless claims data that showed a recovery in the job market appeared to have stalled in late July.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.89% to end at 26,664.4 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.72% to 3,294.61.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.47% to 10,902.80, beating its previous record high close on July 20.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season now past its half-way mark, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates, but the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year.

Drug distributor McKesson Corp jumped 6.5% after boosting its full-year earnings forecast.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 164 new highs and 16 new lows.

About 9.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

At 2:30 pm EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.01% at 26,694.48 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.91% to 3,300.93.

The Nasdaq Composite added 1.58% to 10,915.10.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season now past its half-way mark, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates, but the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year.

Drug distributor McKesson Corp gained 6.6% after boosting its full-year earnings forecast.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 152 new highs and 14 new lows.

By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Medha Singh

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Monday as a rebound in multi-billion dollar deals, including Microsoft's pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations, lifted sentiment as efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed.

Microsoft jumped 4% on saying it would push ahead with talks to buy the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok after President Donald Trump reversed course on a planned ban of the short-video app.

Apple Inc gained for a second straight session following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. At its current share price of about $437, the tech giant is about $132 billion - or around $30 a share - short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.

Tech far outpaced gains among the six of 11 major S&P sectors trading higher.

""Everyone realizes that tech is the place you want to be right now but from market's standpoint, breadth matters,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.

""You want to see banks, industrials do well and that's a pretty good sign of things to come if those sectors are performing.""

A rally in tech-related stocks and historic stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within 3% of its peak, but faltering macroeconomic data and a gridlock on more government stimulus have made investors cautious again.

Congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials resumed talks aimed at reaching a relief bill on Monday afternoon after missing a vital deadline last week to extend benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans.

338,2020-08-03T15:09:34+00:00,Goldman Sachs Comes Up With Tinder for Mergers,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Call it Deal Tinder. Banker Bumble. Or, perhaps more on trend with the vowel-hating naming convention of startups, simply: Bnkr. That’s not the real name, but Wall Street is building a new dealmaking app for the future of mergers and acquisitions in a social-distanced world. After all, this weekend’s flurry of deal activity shows that not even the coronavirus can stifle M&A demand for long.

As air travel remains taboo, and with working from home set to be the norm for corporate offices for the foreseeable future, bankers are looking for new technologies to help their clients find transactions remotely. The Covid-19 pandemic heralded the rise of Zoom Video Communications Inc. and other videoconferencing tools, which have already been used recently by Verizon Communications Inc. and Intel Corp. to negotiate acquisitions valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is building a merger matchmaking app for its investment-banking clients to further aid the process, Bloomberg’s Ed Hammond reports. The app’s real name is Gemini, building off a technology that the company uses internally. (In case Goldman’s rivals are curious, “Bnkr” is still up for grabs.)

The Gemini news comes on the heels of a busy deals weekend as the M&A market starts to show more signs of life. Microsoft Corp. confirmed that it’s in talks to buy the U.S. side of TikTok as the Chinese-owned social-media sensation comes under scrutiny by the Trump administration. (Tim Culpan writes that it could be “the deal of the decade.”) Germany’s Siemens Healthineers AG struck a $16.4 billion deal to acquire Varian Medical Systems Inc., a Palo Alto, California-based maker of cancer-radiation treatments, with the expectation that demand for medical procedures put off by Covid will return. Private equity firms Blackstone Group Inc. and Global Infrastructure Partners are also considering a joint bid for Kansas City Southern, a railroad operator that links Mexico and the U.S. Midwest, in what would amount to a Warren Buffett-esque bet on the U.S. economy.

Story continues

Gone may be the days of a handshake sealing a deal, and M&A volume globally is still down 47% this year at just $1.1 trillion. But the pandemic hasn’t altered the reasons for pursuing transactions. Interest rates remain low amid a global recession triggered by virus fears, and a lack of organic growth continues to point to consolidation across industries. As companies become more comfortable with remote work, they may embrace technology for dealmaking, too.

“The bankers are road warriors, but I think they’re learning quickly that they can get a lot more done this way,” Derek Koecher, Verizon’s vice president of strategy and development, said in a June interview conducted over the BlueJeans videoconferencing software. The wireless carrier acquired BlueJeans for $400 million in April to add to its offerings for business customers.

While Verizon and BlueJeans executives were able to start their negotiations in person in pre-Covid times, once the pandemic hit they were forced to become their own guinea pigs. “That time that you get with the management team — the dinners, the drop-bys, the ‘Hey, I need to come out and see you, let’s have breakfast’ – were completely gone,” Koecher said. “One thing you worry about is culture. Are you going to have the right cultural fit with people you didn’t spend a lot of face-to-face time with? We used the platform to get that management time and intimacy. It was an experiment, and it proved to be quite successful.” No travel delays, and meetings were easier to schedule. There’s also a benefit to being able to literally peer into the other person’s background on screen, a window into their life outside the formal conference-room setting, he said.

Goldman says its app will show how a business stacks up against various revenue and profit metrics, as well as environmental, social and governance standards. (By the way, the Bloomberg terminal can do a lot of that, too. Bloomberg LP is the parent of Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Opinion.) That may help CEOs spot vulnerabilities and merger or spinoff opportunities before activist investors come knocking.(2)

With some inspiration from social-media tools, dealmaking lives on in the Covid era. Maybe even the swipe — the cultural touchstone of millennial dating that’s led to plenty of marriages — could broker mergers next.

* Futures: Dow off 0.06%, S&P flat, Nasdaq up 0.48%

By Sagarika Jaisinghani

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Futures linked to the S&P 500 and the Dow indexes were muted on Monday with lawmakers at an impasse about a coronavirus relief deal, while investors remained cautious after Fitch revised its U.S. outlook to negative, citing eroding credit strength.

Wall Street's main indexes finished July on a high note, powered by stunning quarterly reports by some of the biggest U.S. tech companies, but the gridlock on more government stimulus and faltering economic data has kept investors on edge.

After an extra $600-per-week in jobless benefits expired last week, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Sunday he was not optimistic about reaching an agreement soon for the next relief bill.

With jobless claims rising again, all eyes this week will be on the Labor Department's employment report this Friday, which is expected to show far fewer jobs being created in July after a record surge in the previous month.

Fitch Ratings on Friday cut its outlook on United States' triple-A rating to negative from stable, saying the future direction of U.S. fiscal policy depended in part on the November elections.

On a brighter note, an ISM survey of the manufacturing sector due later in the day is expected to show a slight pickup in July, mirroring upbeat factory activity data from Europe, the United Kingdom and China.

At 6:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 15 points, or 0.06%. S&P 500 e-minis were up just 2.25 points, or 0.07% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 51.75 points, or 0.48%.

Microsoft Corp rose 1.9% in premarket trading as it said it would push ahead with talks to acquire the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok after President Donald Trump reversed course on a planned ban of the short-video app.

Marathon Petroleum Corp jumped 11.4% after it sold its Speedway gas station network for $21 billion in an all-cash deal.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season now past its half-way mark, a record high percentage of companies have beaten dramatically lowered forecasts, but the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year and the biggest quarterly decline since the financial crisis.

Focus will also be on quarterly reports by meat processor Tyson Foods, satellite TV provider Dish Network , drug distributor McKesson Corp and cleaning products maker Clorox Co later in the day.

Looking at the stock market today, the first thought that comes to mind is that it is divorced from economic reality. The S&P 500 is only a few percent away from where it started 2020.

SPY 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of SPY Peter Lynch Chart of SPY

On the surface it looks like stocks discount one incredibly rosy version of the future. In that version everything goes back to normal like nothing happened; we basically just entered and quickly exited a sharp recession and earnings came back to pre-coronavirus normal. Though that is a possible outcome, it is not a probable one, judging by what is happening right now. We'd like to note that, in any scenario, we'll exit with close to $10 trillion of additional debt on the government's and the Fed's balance sheets

I used the word discount. To discount something you bring future earnings (cash flows) at a discount rate to today's dollars. The Federal Reserve bought trillions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds of suspect quality through ETFs, taking interest rates to almost zero. This act has pushed the discount rate lower and wound up the spring of the music box in the Fed's game of musical chairs. So the market behavior to a large degree reflects not the sum of future scenarios but the much lower discount rate by which these scenarios are discounted.

Since the Fed is buying, the music is playing, and investors keep dancing (speculating). Greed is back. It seems that this music just keeps on playing.

But will it?

The economy is a very complex organic system created by trillions of individual transactions. The Fed's involvement introduces inorganic matter into the ecosystem that slowly poisons and atrophies the system. The Fed's active involvement distorts price signaling (higher prices lead to higher demand and vice versa) as it manipulates the price of the most fundamental commodity in the system - interest rates (the price of money).

Story continues

The Fed's buying junk bonds through ETFs has brought us closer to a Walking Dead economy. It has given a further lease on life to mostly dead companies that otherwise would have perished. But it's easy for me to sit here and criticize. If I ran the Fed in March 2020, I probably would have done the same thing - the possible cost of doing nothing would have been a global depression. The bottom line is that the Fed temporarily stimulated a humongous amount of greed in a system that was shaking in fear.

We are not investing in the economy we'd like to have, but in the one we have. However, this dance cannot go on forever or at some point the Fed will own all financial assets and the U.S. economy will turn into a Potemkin village. This is why, though it has been unfashionable and even counterproductive lately, we'll keep sticking to buying great, undervalued companies, not just great companies irrespective of price.

Nifty FANGAM

While you are pondering on this, here is another observation.

If you look deeper under the hood of the stock market, you'll see that there is a significant dichotomy between bytes stocks and atoms stocks. The atoms are losing to the bytes, badly. If you compare performance of the S&P 500 (SPY) traditional market-capitalization index - the one you see in the news - to its less-known cousin, the S&P 500 equal-weighted (RSP), you'll see a significant disparity in performance.

In the market cap-weighted version, the top five stocks (all five are members of FANGAM gang - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) now represent 21% of the capitalization of the index (the last time this happened was 1999) and thus account for 21% of the returns. In RSP these stocks have a weight of 1% (they're just 5 out of 500 stocks).

SPY is down 6% for the year, where RSP is down 16% - remember, same stocks, it's just that SPY is heavily weighted toward bytes stocks, as they have larger market caps, and RSP treats bytes and atoms equally. The virus has been much kinder to bytes than atoms stocks; it has benefitted those companies as our world has become a bit more virtual and atoms were impacted by social distancing. The problem is, bytes were very expensive going into the coronavirus crisis, and they just got even more pricey (unless their businesses have improved to a greater degree than their stocks prices appreciated, which is possible but unlikely, with the possible exception of Amazon).

Just as any propaganda needs a certain germ of truth to grow from, so do bubbles. The FANGAM are incredible companies (germ of truth), and they function better in the virus-infested world (another germ of truth). But at the core, their existence is grounded in the world that is built of atoms, not bytes.

For instance, Google's advertising business will continue to take market share from non-digital forms of advertisement (not sure if any are left), but atom-based companies are the largest source of Google's advertising revenue. If the atom world is not doing well, neither will Google. Also, the law of large numbers usually kicks in at some point: A company cannot grow at supernormal rates forever or it will become bigger than the market it is serving.

The Nifty Fifty stocks come to mind here. Those were the fifty stocks - the who's who of the 1960s -that made America great (then): Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG) ... the list goes on. Though today we look at some of them as has-beens, in the '60s and '70s the world was their oyster. Coke and McDonald's were spring chickens then, spreading the American health values of diabetes and cholesterol (okay, maybe I'm being too hard on them) across this awesome planet.

Although it was hard to imagine in the '70s that any of these companies would not shine forever, they are a useful reminder that even great companies get disrupted. Avon (AVP), Kodak (KODK), Polaroid, GE (GE), Xerox (XRX) -all were Nifty Fifties, and all either went bankrupt or are heading towards irrelevancy.

In the 1960s and early 1970s these stocks were one-rule stock - and the rule was, buy! They were bought, and bought, and bought. They were great companies and paying attention to how much you paid for them was irrelevant.

Until.

The Nifty FANGAM is arguably not as expensive as the Nifty Fifty was in 1972. Lawrence Hamtil put this nice table together, using data gathered by The Brooklyn Investor blog, which divides the Nifty Fifty stocks into two groups. The cheap basket traded at around 28 times earnings and the expensive basket at about 60 or so. Neither the cheap nor the expensive basket did well in the decade of the '70s. Today, FANGAM stocks in general trade closer to the cheap basket's valuation.

If you bought and held Coke or McDonald's in 1972 (or any other Nifty Fifty stock), then you experienced a painful decade of no returns; in fact, at times you were down 50% or more. Coca Cola was as great a company in 1974 as it was in 1972, but the stock was down 50% from its high. Okay, Coca Cola was trading at 47 times earnings in 1972. But even a company like Procter & Gamble that was trading at ""only"" 32 times earnings in 1972 was down almost 50% in 1974 from its 1972 high. It took until the early 80s - a decade - until investors who bought Nifty Fifties at the top broke even - and this applies to almost all of them.

Nifty Fifty (1970's)

In today's far less patient world, that decade might as well be infinity.

As I am writing this I am struggling with a few issues. First, interest rates and inflation were much higher in the '70s and early '80s. Now, interest rates are at zero, going to negative or to ... no idea what level. Globalization was deflationary, thus de-globalization will likely be inflationary; but automation may dampen the inflationary impact, at least some of it. If we get negative rates, then on one hand they should boost stocks' price-to-earnings ratio. (Paradoxically, the further a company's cash flow is in the future, the more it is worth in today's dollars. Yes, makes little sense to us, either). On the other hand, if we have negative rates, that means we are desperate and thus earnings are collapsing.

In an inflationary environment, most earnings growth will be eaten away by declining price-to-earnings, as it happened in the '70s.

Another issue: If you held many Nifty Fifties for 20 years, from 1972 to 1992, they would have delivered a decent (10%-plus) return. This sounds great in theory; however, most people would have run out of patience after a decade of no or negative returns and thus not have been around for the fruits of the '80s decade. In other words, shareholders who bought the stocks in 1970 were not the ones who benefitted from the returns in the late '80s.

Today the Nifty FANGAM has turned into one-rule stocks - buy! (irrespective of price). If you did not own them over the last decade, your portfolio had an enormous headwind against it.

But what the Nifty Fifties showed us is that company greatness and past growth are not enough. Starting valuation - what you actually pay for the business -matters. The great companies will still be great when their stocks are down a bunch and they have a decade of no returns. Dividends aside, stock returns in the long run are not just driven by earnings growth but by what the price-to-earnings does as well. If price-to-earnings is high, it's mean reverts - declines - chipping away at the return you receive from earnings growth. I (this is Vitaliy) wrote two books on this topic.

The '70s were almost fifty years ago. Fine, just look up Microsoft, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Coca Cola, and Wal-Mart (WMT) stock charts from the late '90s, and you'll see that history repeats itself, again and again (see charts below).

What you pay for even a great company matters. Paraphrasing the great Freddie Mercury, there must be more to the stock market than FANGAM (though that has not been the case lately). They were the tailwind for the S&P 500, but they'll likely turn into a headwind over the next decade, and become an anchor around its neck.

I am not a journalist or reporter; I am an investor who thinks through writing. This and other investment articles are just my thinking at the point they were written. However, investment research is not static, it is fluid. New information comes our way and we continue to do research, which may lead us to tweak and modify assumptions and thus to change our minds.

We are long-term investors and often hold stocks for years, but as luck may or may not have it, by the time you read this article we may have already sold the stock. I may or may not write about this company ever again. Think of this and other articles as learning and thinking frameworks. But they are not investment recommendations. The bottom line is this. If this article piques your interest in the company I've mentioned, great. This should be the beginning, not the end, of your research.

342,2020-06-29T20:52:47+00:00,"Facebook Sales at Risk as Starbucks Bails, GM Plans Review","(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. fielded criticism from a growing number of consumer companies over harmful content on its sites, with Starbucks Corp. and Diageo Plc pulling back on ad spending and General Motors Co. planning to review its social media marketing strategy.

Starbucks and Diageo followed Unilever, Coca-Cola Co. and several other companies in saying they will cut ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to limit hate speech and posts that divide and misinform. Microsoft Corp., which was Facebook’s third-largest advertiser last year, has paused global ad spending on the site because of concerns about ads appearing next to inappropriate content, according to a person familiar with the matter. The list of companies taking similar action lengthened on Monday. Britvic Plc, which supplies a wide range of soft drinks, Patreon Inc. and The Clorox Co. all said they will stop advertising on Facebook while GM said it’s “reviewing and reinforcing” its marketing guidelines.

While a single advertiser can do little to hurt a company that generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter, the rising tally creates peer pressure on other brands, and civil rights groups say they expect more corporations to join a boycott. Combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook is deepening.

“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”

Shares gained 2.1% Monday to close at $220.64 in New York, after dropping 8.3% on Friday. Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would cease spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion.

Story continues

Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in an April earnings call that he saw the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”

The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in spending. Facebook’s sales will rise 1% in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, analysts predict, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.

Advertiser boycotts in July could cost Facebook more than $250 million in the third quarter if 25% of its top 100 buyers pause spending, and as much as $500 million if 50% of the top advertisers stop, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral.Zuckerberg announced changes Friday designed to appease critics, but the Anti-Defamation League, one of the groups calling for the boycott, called the amendments “small.”

Some analysts have said the financial impact of recent exits will be limited, citing past advertiser revolts. Even so, this exodus is distinct in key ways, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil-rights groups, he said.

“The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”

But their business models are broken, and the giant disruptors may about to be disrupted themselves.

That $70 billion for Uber and Lyft is the same as the top three American automakers--GM, Ford and Chrysler--combined.

Now, a startup that launched in late 2019 in Canada is looking to challenge them.

Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) is leading the evolution of shared mobility, and it’s got the new business model to lure in big capital that’s tired of the big competitors’ cash burn, bad press and endless unprofitability.

It’s sharp, sleek, ultra-high-tech, eco-friendly and it does three things that no ride-sharing company has ever done:

It is the first to offer EVs and hybrids, and to plant trees to offset its carbon footprint.

It brings cities and communities on as stakeholders, rather than defying them, and treats its drivers as people who deserve living wages.

It views shared mobility as much more than a ride and has launched multiple revenue streams that take advantage of the rider relationship.

And now, it’s going global after a series of smart acquisitions and new service launches that have positioned it to be a key challenger to the shared mobility throne.

It’s hard to argue with the $30-billion-plus megatrend of sustainable investing that says disruption is in order.

Here are 5 Reasons to keep a close eye on Facedrive right now:

#1 Facedrive Has What Big Capital Wants

There’s a reason BlackRock is blowing Wall Street out of the water right now--sustainable investing.

ESG (environmental, social and governance) investing isn't just a fad anymore--it's minting millionaires and billionaires. It's in high demand, and it's pressuring companies to make major changes. It's the ethical squeeze of the century.

Story continues

From Jeff Bezos' $10-billion commitment to a Global Earth Fund to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, we're now seeing major ESG assets under management. BlackRock will increase its ESG assets from $90 billion to $1 trillion within a decade.

And word on the street is that BlackRock has now replaced Goldman Sachs to become the most important banking company in the world. BlackRock is all about technology, and all about mitigating risk through sustainable companies.

That’s exactly what Facedrive is all about, too.

And it fixes things that are wrong with giants Uber and Lyft in the high-tech, shared-mobility world that has lifted BlackRock to “4th branch of government” status.

Ride-sharing has been anything BUT sustainable. It’s having a hugely negative impact on the environment, with estimates that the average ride-hail results in nearly 70% more pollution than whatever transportation it displaced. That’s hardly the choice for eco-conscious Millennials.

Facedrive’s next-gen ride-sharing is the first to offer customers a choice for every ride; whether they want an EV, a hybrid, or a conventional car. Then it offsets CO2 by planting trees along the way.

The Canadian startup has positioned itself to help solve ride-sharing’s environmental problem by changing its footprint, —and aims to do so without sacrificing profit, which Uber may never even make anyway.

Although Facedrive offers competitive journey fares, riders do not pay a premium for CO2 emissions offsetting while drivers do not lose any of their fares to pay for the green initiative.

Facedrive’s green strategy is simple yet highly effective and cheaper than fancier solutions being adopted by some so-called big companies.

Globally each year, plants remove about 25% of the carbon emissions produced by human activities such as burning fossil fuels while a similar amount ends up in the oceans. So, Facedrive is getting back to Mother Nature--and millennials and investors are loving it.

That puts Facedrive squarely in the middle of two megatrends: The disruption of the predicted to be $8 trillion transportation service industry and the shift of big money into sustainable investing, which already topped $30 billion in 2018.

Carbon-neutral ride-sharing ticks every a lot of boxes with the new kings of Wall Street.

#2 On the Front Lines of COVID

A few weeks ago, as global COVID-19 deaths topped 355,000, Facedrive had rolled out top-notch coronavirus tracking tech --and then landed a major contract immediately.

The Labourers’ International Union of North America (LiUNA) announced it would adopt Facedrive’s TraceSCAN digital COVID-19 contract-tracing app to protect the health and safety of its 130,000 members and their families in Canada.

That’s a huge boost for a brand new, high-tech app developed in a joint initiative by Facedrive Health and the University of Waterloo.

The TraceSCAN app and wearables provide contact tracing to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Using Bluetooth technology, TraceSCAN alerts users with a notification if they have come in contact with an individual who has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.

The next logical step here for Facedrive is to market to other unions and councils—and possibly even the Canadian government—to jump on the TraceSCAN bandwagon.

#3 Revenue from Multiple Angles

But this is about short term and long term … and now that we’ve seen the tech Facedrive can develop, watch it also capture the explosive food delivery industry by applying its new business model to absolutely every rider-relationship revenue stream it can think of.

Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) isn’t just challenging Uber in the ride-sharing space. It’s now challenging it in the food delivery space, as well.

And it’s going for full-on involvement.

Kicking off its aggressive expansion drive in the food delivery segment, Facedrive entered into a binding term sheet to acquire the assets of Foodora Canada, a subsidiary of the $20-billion multinational food delivery service Delivery Hero, which operates in over 40 countries and services more than 500,000 restaurants.

Facedrive’s acquisition of the Foodora Canada food delivery business will give it hundreds of thousands of customer names and over 5,500 new restaurant partners for just a part of the high-tech mobility company’s revenue-generating ecosystem.

Worth $24 billion already in 2018 and set to top $98 billion by 2027, the global food delivery market is now officially at war. And it’s a war even more ferocious than streaming.

The stakes have never been higher for the delivery industry, whose giants are burning cash like crazy and still unsure they will ever turn a profit.

The name of the game now for some is consolidation--at any price.

But this war is ripe for a new alliance to disrupt a fast growing industry that is now hated on multiple fronts, with restaurants held prisoner to delivery bullies, prompting some city authorities to step in to cap commissions.

While Uber is prepared to pay a premium for the Grubhub--the delivery service with the biggest US market share--Facedrive the new face of “sharing”, is cutting a food delivery acquisition deal for what looks like pennies on the dollar.

The winner of this war will be the new sharing business model that defies the out-of-control cash burn, broadens the revenue potential and wins the hearts and minds of every stakeholder in the chain, including drivers and restaurants.

Globally, only Delivery Hero comes out of this heroically--among the giants. That company even refers to itself as the “United Nations of food delivery”. That’s because it spans 28 brands in over 40 countries. And it makes restaurants happy instead of gouging them.

Delivery Hero’s success is all about the marketing, which everyone else is getting wrong, according to Forbes. It’s been summed up by Delivery Hero CMO Mats Diedrichsen like this: The ‘Big Picture” is to turn “brand interest into brand love” with a marketing approach that goes “beyond audience segmentation to drive deep emotional connection.”

And for Canada, Facedrive wants to be that emotional connection.

This new acquisition should give Facedrive a huge revenue boost, challenging struggling competitors such as Uber Eats and Skip The Dishes.

Overnight, Facedrive is set to position itself into the top echelon of Canadian food delivery services. Then targeting global expansion.

Plus a line-up of other revenue-generators in its brilliant ecosystem …

That includes Facedrive Health, a comprehensive health initiative timed for rapid deployment to the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Facedrive Healthcare includes everything from discounted rides for healthcare workers and specialized vehicles for anyone with additional needs, to contactless delivery of essential over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies, including high-tech management of automatic refills.

There’s nothing that shared mobility can’t touch, if it’s got the right branding ...

#4 Branding: Mighty Merch With Celebrity Appeal

Shared mobility isn’t just about hitching a ride. Facedrive is trying to make it an entire lifestyle megatrend. That’s what the giants just don’t get. It’s about convenience, connecting, and community. That’s what it’s about because that’s what Millennials want, and they are the driving force of money behind all of this.

Uber’s brand is associated with … bad press, mostly. The service everyone loves to hate and hates to love because there hasn’t been much choice.

Branding is everything, and that’s where Facedrive is armed to the hilt in this war for positive branding.

Facedrive is associated with the community, with benefits for all stakeholders, with sustainability

…  with lifestyle.

Its motto is “people and planet first”, and it has attracted some huge names, including Will Smith.

The Facedrive brand is aiming to become a household name. Will Smith’s Bel Air Athletics clothing brand is betting that Facedrive is the ride of the future. That’s why he’s co-branding an entire line of exclusive clothing with Facedrive.

It’s also why WestBrook Inc., the company he shares with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, is partnering with this ride-share startup that is now expanding globally to challenge Uber for the throne.

Even better: Bel-Air Athletics is green and in line with Facedrive principles as the goal is to ensure by next year that all clothing materials are 100% sustainably sourced.

Over 1,000 new products co-branded by Bel Air and Facedrive have launched on the Facedrive marketplace website and the demand has been great

#5 The New Silicon Valley

Facedrive, is one of the biggest things to emerge from Ontario’s ‘Technology Triangle’, also called “Waterloo”. It’s not only Canada’s answer to Silicon Valley, but it’s also fast growing as a  startup tech hub.

And Sayan Navaratnam is the Canadian billionaire mastermind behind it all. He caught on to the megatrend of sustainable investing years ago. Already in 2016, he saw where Uber and Lyft were going to fail, and where big money was going to run.

“We’re all about grabbing onto the biggest trends in tech before they’re mega-trends. So that takes us back to 2016, when we first came up with the idea. Whenever a major new trend emerges, it’s the job of the truly innovative to step back and say ‘OK, this is an explosively great idea - so what’s wrong with it?’ When you figure that out, and you’ve got the right network and the right people behind you, you can jump in on one of the biggest trends and disrupt a massive market at exactly the right time,” Navaratnam told us earlier this year.

Facedrive launched in Q3 2019, and already we’re looking at explosive news flow and a string of smart acquisitions--all leading to global expansion plans.

The deal timeline has been so fast-paced that’s it’s hard to keep up:

First, in April, it acquired HiRide--another ‘Technology Triangle’ innovator that came out of Ontario’s version of “Shark Tank”, “Dragon’s Den”, giving Facedrive access to the entire user base of a unique long-distance car-pooling solution for students and professionals. For its expansion plans, that gives Facedrive the first mile, last mile and … long mile.  Over the next two months, without missing a beat, it launched a string of new revenue-generating services from Facedrive Foods and Facedrive Health to COVID-19 TraceScan, and even its own exclusive line of Bel-Air clothing co-branded with Will Smith.  Then in early May, it landed a deal with the North American labor union to use TraceScan  Days later, it announced plans to acquire Foodora Canada from Delivery Hero in a deal that solidifies the launch of Facedrive Foods … with a bang.  Launched Marketplace with Westbrook

What we have here is a company that is working to monetize every angle of its high-tech sharing experience right out of the blocks--all without butting heads with regulators or making enemies out of local officials.

What we have is a potential challenger to the shared mobility throne, in more ways than one. It’s exactly the sustainability that Big Money is looking for --and while some may be sleeping while Facedrive prepares for global expansion, others are very awake. Other companies capitalizing on new market trends:

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)

BlackRock needs no introduction. It is the world’s largest global investment management corporation, with over $7.4 trillion in assets under management. With clients in over 100 different countries, it is the de facto leader in its field.

In 2017, BlackRock underwent a major shift in its investment strategy, prioritizing stocks with high ESG ratings. BlackRock’s focus on technology and sustainability has fueled the new trend in the marketplace, pushing even more investors to consciously consider where they put their money.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)

Facebook, as one of the world’s largest technology companies, has completely changed the game. It has taken a particularly innovative approach in creating a more sustainable future and has become an example for the entire industry. Its data centers are some of the most energy-efficient - and water-efficient - in the world.

And it’s only getting started. By the end of 2020, Facebook is aiming to have all of its data centers running on 100% renewable energy. Additionally, Facebook has committed to adding over 4.0 GW of renewable energy to the grid.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Google is another tech giant going green. It is focused on raising the bar for smart use of the world’s resources. Like Facebook, Google is creating sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and workplaces. It is also leveraging artificial intelligence to develop more sustainable energy use.

Not only is Google changing the game in its own operations, it is also building a completely sustainable supply chain. And it isn’t stopping there. It is also working with its partner companies to help them go green!

TSLA (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Tesla might just be one of the hottest stocks in the ESG space. As one of the world’s most innovative car manufacturers, it has single handedly made going green cool. Its slick design has become all the rage. You would have to go out of your way to not see a Tesla when walking around major cities like San Francisco and Hong Kong.

And CEO Elon Musk hasn’t stopped there. In addition to producing one of the most desirable electric vehicles on the market, Tesla is ramping up its solar game, as well. Tesla’s Solar Roof project aims to change the way houses function. It replaces traditional roofs with stronger, and arguably more aesthetically pleasing, solar panels that can power your entire home. It also comes in as the lowest-cost-per-watt solar option in the American market.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Microsoft is going above and beyond in its emissions goals, aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. A feat that will not be an easy task for such a massive technology corporation. Additionally, Microsoft is has also pioneered new solutions to aid other companies in curbing their emissions as well.

Microsoft has built hardware and software to help monitor and better understand the effect of different institutions have on the planet, gathering data to better figure out how companies and people can improve. The company is creating tools to better handle the b the world’s growing waste crisis.

Shopify Inc (TSX:SH)

Shopify is a Canadian e-commerce company. More than 1,000,000 businesses rely on Shopify’s real-time e-commerce, including Tesla, Budweiser and Red Bull, among many others. Shopify makes purchasing goods and services easy for anyone – and in a time where convenience is king, Shopify surely has staying power.

In addition to its revolutionary approach on e-commerce, Shopify is also delving into blockchain technology, making it a promising pick for investors in sustainability.

Shaw Communications Inc (TSE:SJR.B)

Shaw owns a ton of infrastructure throughout Canada and its cloud services and open-source projects look to address some of the biggest issues that its customers might face before the customers even face them. Shaw’s dominance in Canada’s telecom sector means that if any internet-based services want to operate, they’ll likely be utilizing the company’s infrastructure. After all, without telecoms, these TaaS companies would not be able to operate.

BCE Inc. (TSX:BCE)

Like Shaw, BCE is a Canadian telecom giant. Founded in 1980, the company, formally The Bell Telephone Company of Canada is composed of three primary subsidiaries. Bell Wireless, Bell Wireline and Bell Media, however throughout its push into the position of one of Canada’s top telco groups, it has bought and sold a number of different firms.

BCE is also at the forefront of the Internet of Things movement in Canada. Its Machine to Machine solutions are being used by numerous businesses, including TaaS providers throughout North America and its new LTE-M network is sure to rapidly increase the adoption of these solutions.

Polaris Infrastructure (TSX:PIF)

Polaris is a Toronto-based renewable energy giant with a global footprint. The company’s biggest projects are in Latin America. It’s Nicaragua geothermal project, for example, is already producing over 77 MW of renewable electricity.  And in Peru, its El Carmen and 8 de Augusto power plants, is set to produce a combined 17MW of electricity in the near future.

Westport Fuel Systems (TSX:WPRT)

Westport is a renewable energy provider for the transportation industry. it provides systems for less impactful fuels, such as natural gas. In North America alone, there are over 225,000 natural gas vehicles. But that shies in comparison to the global 22.5 million natural gas vehicles globally, which means the company still has a ton of room to grow!

While renewable providers clearly take the lead, Canada’s tech and telecom giants won’t be left out!

The company has a new title in its ""Nier"" series that should draw return players as well as a ""Marvel's Avengers"" title pending release that should draw in crowds from the movie's fanbase.

Next generation consoles

For the coming holiday season of this year, October through December, gaming powerhouses Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE) both have planned the release of their next generation consoles. The two systems are both advertised to rival current computer abilities and are hoping to draw from that player base.

For the most part, current development from these game development studios is focused on current generation consoles. This allows them to continue to draw from their existing player bases and avoid the development of better graphics and optimized games.

With the release of the next generation consoles later this year, all of these studios will be forced to pivot their existing benchmarks for the new systems. Without the ability to pivot to supporting the new technology, these companies will likely see their player base fade alongside their profits.

346,2020-06-19T12:56:05+00:00,The 3 Best Vanguard ETFs  for a Long-Term Retirement Portfolio,"When building a retirement portfolio, the goal is to grow your assets for the long term. Since no one knows which asset classes will lead and which will lag, diversification is paramount. And Vanguard ETFs are an easy way to get some diversification.

If you’re further than 10 years from retirement, it’s wise to lean towards a more aggressive portfolio to capture the higher equity returns. As retirement approaches, dial back equities and increase fixed and cash equivalent holdings.

If you’re healthy and retire in your 60’s you might have an additional 20-plus years in retirement, so don’t forgo the stock market. In fact, you may want to ramp up equity investing as your retirement advances. This reverse glidepath strategy was suggested by Michael Kitces and Wade Pfau in an article on the Nerd’s Eye View entitled, “Should Equity Exposure Decrease In Retirement, Or Is A Rising Equity Glidepath Actually Better?”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

These three Vanguard exchange-traded funds will work when building a retirement portfolio as well as during the drawdown years. Each of the Vanguard funds can be purchased through any investment account, while other financial firms offer comparable funds. The key to this simple retirement portfolio is to  invest in low-fee index ETFs that fit within these categories.

7 A-Rated Growth Stocks That Are Loaded With Long-Term Potential

The rationale for a three-fund retirement portfolio is as follows. First, a simple investment portfolio in retirement leaves time for what matters most. Second, it provides diversification to minimize losses in a particular sector while maintaining broad exposure to the main asset classes and global markets. And finally, it cuts investment fees to the bone.

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI) Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (NYSEARCA:VEU) Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (NASDAQ:BND)

And now, let’s get further into why I like these three funds in particular.

Story continues

Best Vanguard ETFs: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)

Expense Ratio: 0.03%, or $3 per $10,000 invested annually.

This U.S. stock market fund tracks the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index. The benchmark includes companies spanning the mega-, large-, small- and micro-capitalization field and represents nearly 100% of the U.S. investable equity market.

The fund utilizes a passively managed, index-sampling strategy. VTI offers rock-bottom expenses and minimal tracking error versus the benchmark index. This total stock market fund owns roughly 3,500 stocks, with 22.6% of the assets in the 10 largest names.

The fund uses a market cap weighting, which means that returns will be influenced by the momentum growth of the biggest firms.

Investors seeking a more value-leaning equal weight US stock index fund might consider the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA:RSP).

The funds sector weightings approximate the benchmark index, with approximately 25% in the technology sector, 17% in financials, 15% in healthcare and 14% in consumer services.

The largest holdings read like a who’s-who in American commerce and include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The returns of the fund parallel those of the index with a 10-year average annual return of 12.8%, and one-, three- and five-year returns of 11.5%, 9.6%, and 9.2% respectively.

Investing in the U.S. equity market has been a sound investment strategy for decades, and the 0.03% expense ratio is among the most affordable ways of capturing this growth. The current 1.8% 30-day SEC yield is higher than investors receive on most short-term cash equivalents.

Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU)

Expense Ratio: 0.08%

This large-cap-leaning international fund invests in developing and emerging market global companies. The passively managed fund attempts to match the returns of the FTSE All World ex-U.S. index. Investors willing to take a bit more risk for potentially higher returns among Vanguard ETFs might consider the Vanguard Total Stock International Index ETF (NASDAQ:VXUS) instead, which includes greater small-cap international exposure.

Like VTI, the VEU’s holdings are weighted by market cap, so the larger companies are a greater proportion of the fund. The allocation is geographically diversified, with 41% invested in Europe, 23% in in Emerging Markets, 29% in the Pacific and the remaining firms from North America and the Middle East.

The top holdings are well-known global names. Although, the top 10 holdings make up only 11.5% of the total fund assets. The largest holdings include Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) and Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). Other major companies are representatives of the auto, pharmaceutical, electronic and oil industries.

10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge

The fund’s 0.08% expense ratio keeps most investment dollars in the markets, not flowing to the fund manager. Recently, international markets have underperformed the U.S., but seem to be turning around this year.

Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

Expense Ratio: 0.035%

A total bond market fund rounds out this three-piece retirement portfolio of Vanguard ETFs. Bonds are still valuable to own as eventually; interest rates will rise along with bond yields.

Another Vanguard low-fee offer, BND is an intermediate bond fund with the objective to track a broad, market-weight bond index. Included in the fund are taxable investment-grade U.S. bonds. With 9,568 bonds and an average duration of 6.4 years, the current SEC yield is 1.4%.

The fund is heavily weighted to U.S. Government bonds, with 61% in this asset class. The next-highest weighting of 19% is in Baa rated bonds. And 12.6% of the fund is invested in A bonds with a small percent allocated to Aaa and Aa rated bonds. The 0.035% expense ratio is negligible.

In summation, create your asset allocation to fit your comfort with investment volatility. Allot greater percentages to the stock market if you’re younger and more comfortable with risk. If not, bulk up your bond investment.

Retirees should consider their short and intermediate cash flow needs and invest accordingly. Meanwhile, it’s prudent to keep at least one year’s living expenses in a high yield cash account.

347,2020-06-18T01:34:05+00:00,"Nintendo Hits 12-Year High on Pokemon, Concerns of ‘Second Wave’","(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co.’s stock has surged to levels not seen since the height of Wii mania.

Shares in the videogame maker climbed as much as 2.7% in Tokyo Thursday, lifting the stock past the 50,000 yen barrier for the first time since September 2008. Shares have in recent days been driven by rising fears of a coronavirus second wave, and were boosted further by the announcement of new Pokemon games for both Switch and mobile.

The announcement of the Pokemon games by Nintendo and Pokemon Co., in which Nintendo owns a significant stake, was long overdue. The Nintendo 64 game Pokemon Snap will be getting a sequel on Switch, while a paid expansion was announced for the Switch titles Pokemon Sword and Shield, which have sold more than 17 million copies. Pokemon developers also said they would share news on a further “big project” on June 24.

Nintendo’s Switch console-handheld hybrid was a hit product during global lockdowns, sold out in many regions and was buoyed by the surprising success of laid-back social simulator Animal Crossing: New Horizons. With cases reappearing in Beijing and increasing in the U.S., the prospect of more lockdowns has helped boosted the shares out of its two-month plateau.

“The stock had been struggling the past two months with demand for stay-at-home stocks dropping as the economy re-opened and the state of emergency in Japan was lifted,” Katsuyuki Fujii, an analyst at Asunaro Investment, said Thursday. “But as fears for the second wave of coronavirus grow, people are taking a second look at those stocks.”

Shares hit an all-time high of 73,200 yen in November 2007, when the Wii was the must-have hit product.

Investors and gamers alike have been wondering what the company has in store for the rest of the year, with Nintendo’s slate looking remarkably bare. Beyond Pokemon, there are almost no titles in its hit franchises with set release windows -- despite Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. both preparing to spend big as they roll out new generations of their PlayStation and Xbox consoles this holiday season.

Story continues

“The shares have remained range-bound due to concerns over the lack of upcoming titles,” Daiwa Securities analyst Takao Suzuki wrote in a note dated June 9 in which he raised his price target to 55,000 yen. “We look for new title announcements and a surge in digital sales, other than those for Animal Crossing: New Horizons.”

Sony announced more than 20 new titles when it showed off the PlayStation 5 for the first time last week, while Microsoft showcased more than a dozen Xbox Series X titles in May. At Nintendo’s most recent earnings in May it had no major titles listed for release in the rest of 2020.

All eyes will now be on the Kyoto gamemaker to say that it will hold one of its own “Nintendo Direct” online presentations, which has been the company’s favored method of revealing showcase titles in recent years. It has been almost a year since Nintendo held a major one of these announcements in which it unveiled key new titles, with the Mario Kart and Zelda franchises among those due to receive new entries.

Beyond this year’s slate, hopes are also high for the company in 2021. JPMorgan analyst Haruka Mori on June 10 raised her price target for Nintendo by 18% to 52,000 yen, saying that the Covid-related demand growth didn’t look temporary. “We believe the Covid-19 pandemic has expanded earnings opportunities for the Nintendo Switch platform beyond one-off special demand,” Mori wrote.

Despite a lack of short-term causes for the stock to move, Nintendo has multiple opportunities in the mid-term, Mori said in a note, citing catalysts for 2021 that included a possible new Switch model, a price cut for existing models and advances for its team-up with Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China.

348,2020-06-15T11:53:05+00:00,Exciting Tech ETF May Be More Defensive Than It Appears,"Leveraged exchange traded funds, such as the Direxion Daily Technology Bull3X Shares (NYSE: TECL), usually aren't viewed as defensive ideas. They certainly aren't long-term trades, but some market observers are highlighting the defensive properties of technology stocks.

What Happened

TECL is designed to deliver triple the daily returns of the Technology Select Sector Index. In effect, TECL is a leveraged play on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) because those two stock combine for about 40% of the Technology Select Sector Index.

No, the tech sector hasn't been perfect this year. It's taken some lumps along with other groups at the hands of the coronavirus, but it's also been one of the best-performing groups, a theme some experts see continuing in the back half of the year.

Why It's Important

“While tech earnings have been hit along with everyone else, they are holding up remarkably well,” said BlackRock in a recent note. “This is not surprising. Although the lockdown is crushing spending, tech continues to dominate wallet share, both for individuals and companies. A recent Fortune 500 CEO poll found that 75% of companies plan to increase technology spending.”

TECL is higher by 24% of the past month and since the start of the second quarter, traders added nearly $32 million to the geared tech fund. However, TECL's bearish counterpart – the Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS) – has inflows of $40.15 million since April 1. Leveraged ETFs are often fertile territory for contrarian bets, but the bullish TECL looks like the way to proceed over the near-term.

“Many of the business and broader societal changes demanded by the virus accelerate existing trends: internet commerce, cloud computing, gaming, streaming and remote communication,” according to BlackRock. “One example: retail e-commerce spending is up nearly 60% year-over-year. While some of this is temporary and should reverse as the crisis fades, many of these trends will remain long after COVID 19 has been defeated.”

Story continues

What's Next

As for issues that could bring the bearish TECS into focus, politics and rapid developments on the coronavirus vaccine front come to mind. It's hard to see the latter derailing tech, but it could encourage some investors to  embrace riskier sectors, forcing lower allocations to higher quality tech.

Regarding November elections, “it is easy to forget that a potentially seismic election is less than six months away. Depending on the outcome, the policy environment could shift in ways less favorable for large tech firms,” said BlackRock.

350,2020-06-09T21:00:00+00:00,"Tencent Targets Japan Anime, Manga to Jump-Start Global Growth","(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd., spurned in years past by Japan’s guarded entertainment industry, is rekindling its courtship of the country’s fabled anime and manga houses.

The Chinese social media giant has in recent months scooped up slices of two prominent local studios, the brains behind smash hit Nier: Automata and Marvelous Inc. Those outlays are just the start of a spending spree designed to extend Tencent’s foothold in a key creative hub while imbibing Japan’s expertise in console game making and hit franchise creation, according to people familiar with its strategy. The Chinese firm is in negotiations with several other studios on potential investments, they said.

Tencent has long regarded Japanese entertainment exports as an area ripe for optimization, where better distribution and marketing strategies can generate vastly greater revenues. Having cut its teeth on multibillion-dollar acquisitions of the likes of Clash of Clans developer Supercell Oy and Fortnite creator Epic Games Inc., the Chinese publishing powerhouse has been repeatedly rebuffed when trying to take over developers and studios in Japan. Its new approach is to spend on becoming a favored partner instead, buying board seats and priority access to new content, said the people, who asked for anonymity because the plans are not public.

Tencent’s gaming division declined to comment.

Commonly abbreviated to ACG, Japan’s anime, comic book and gaming franchises are already popular in Tencent’s domestic market of China, the world’s biggest mobile gaming arena. They’ve fueled the rise of services like streaming platform Bilibili Inc. and provided the characters for many of the country’s favorite games. But Japanese creators, loath to cede control of their prized assets, have preferred ad hoc licensing deals, leading to bidding wars between publishers like Tencent and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., who each have competing Naruto games in China. ByteDance is preparing for a big push into gaming this year and NetEase Inc., the other big games publisher in China, has just announced it’s opening a game-development studio in Tokyo.

Story continues

“Japanese ACGs are world class, while their Chinese counterparts are years behind. Even Tencent cannot cultivate sophisticated IP expertise internally fast enough,” said Tokyo-based games industry analyst Serkan Toto. “It’s all about quick international expansion, access to established ACG properties, and insight into creating top-notch IPs from scratch.”

Tencent’s vision is to help set up Marvel Universe-like multimedia franchises, with a focus on turning celebrated anime and manga comic book heroes and storylines into video games, squeezing the most out of each intellectual property. With its control of WeChat, China’s super-app and go-to messaging platform, the company has a significant advantage in cross-promoting its wares.

The Japanese creative scene is rich on potential targets, said Hideki Yasuda of Ace Research Institute. Popular IPs like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Doraemon are recognized in China, but haven’t yet translated into major gaming hits in that country. Games like LovePlus by Konami Holdings Corp., Disgaea by Nippon Ichi Software Inc. and Legend of Heroes by Nihon Falcom Corp. also hold growth potential if properly adapted and distributed in Tencent’s home market.

The Shenzhen-based company commands roughly half of China’s $33 billion mobile and PC gaming industry, data from research firm Niko Partners shows. That arena is increasingly dominated by titles built on already-familiar characters and lore, as 73 of the top 100 grossing mobile games last year were based on existing IP, according to Analysys.

Tencent approached Tokyo-based Marvelous -- seeking to tap its IP library, console development expertise and connections with other ACG creators -- in April, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter. Marvelous is known for the Story of Seasons farming simulation and produces theater shows based on hit anime series like Prince of Tennis (which in itself was an adaptation of a successful manga series).

The 7 billion yen ($65 million) that Tencent is spending for a 20% stake grants it pole position for licensing Marvelous IP and makes the head of Tencent Japan an external director. Tencent wanted that board presence in order to have an insider’s view of the company’s product pipeline, the people said.

“Marvelous covers ACG through and through -- a great target for Tencent,” said Toto. And for Japanese ACG creators, “Tencent is a great, established name to be associated with.”

Fighting a tough battle against fiercely competitive domestic rivals, Tencent appears willing to spend extra to secure the rights to popular Japanese franchises, hoping to leverage them into multimedia juggernauts that lock Chinese consumers into its ecosystem and bolster its global ambitions.

Equally important for Tencent was Marvelous’ success in developing console games. The Chinese behemoth is virtually absent from that contest, which accounts for 30% of overall game industry revenue according to Newzoo data. With a new generation of consoles from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. on the holiday-season horizon and a budding partnership with Nintendo Co. as the sole distributor of official Switch hardware and software in China, Tencent is evidently interested in having a larger presence on this front.

Tencent also made an investment in Bayonetta and Nier: Automata maker PlatinumGames Inc. earlier this year. In February, PlatinumGames co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Sato assured fans that the so-called capital alliance with Tencent wouldn’t affect the company’s management, saying “They respect our autonomy as game creators.”

The studio, whose work has until now been published by larger partners like Nintendo and Square Enix Holdings Co., had been looking for help to grow and become its own publisher, whereas Tencent saw high potential for its creations in the Chinese and mobile markets. The deal was “a win-win situation,” Sato wrote.

“Japan and China have formed a symbiotic relationship for games in recent years with gaming companies from each country learning from each other to succeed in both markets,” said Niko Partners researcher Daniel Ahmad.

The U.S. online retailer is in early-stage discussions to buy about a 5% stake in the Indian wireless operator, Reuters said, citing anonymous sources. A deal will help Amazon access Bharti’s 300 million subscribers -- a user base akin to the entire U.S. population. On Friday, the Indian carrier said in a statement it wasn’t considering any proposal to sell a stake to Amazon, referring to reports as “speculative.”

American technology and investment giants have been buying stakes in Indian companies to build their presence in Asia’s second-most populous nation. Facebook agreed to invest about $5.7 billion into a unit of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. in April, while Microsoft Corp. is reportedly considering a stake in the same company.

Amazon already has deep roots in India, where Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has visited and vowed to build one of his biggest e-commerce operations outside of the U.S. Bezos, now the world’s richest man, said during a trip in January that his company would invest another $1 billion on top of the billions it’s shelled out to bring small and medium-size businesses online. Amazon is now vying with Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart to tap an increasingly affluent population adopting smartphones at a rapid clip.

An Amazon spokeswoman in India declined to comment. “We routinely work with all digital and OTT players and have deep engagement with them to bring their products, content and services for our wide customer base. Beyond that there is no other activity to report,” a Bharti spokesperson said.

An influx of capital would be welcome to New Delhi-based Bharti Airtel, which has come under pressure to beef up its offerings ever since Ambani’s technology venture went on a deal spree to secure about $10 billion in investment from Facebook to KKR & Co. Airtel’s billionaire Chairman Sunil Mittal may be looking to leverage the diverse businesses in his empire just as Ambani goes into overdrive to transform his oil-and-petrochemicals company into an Indian e-commerce and digital payments titan with Jio Platforms.

In its 25 years of operations, Bharti Airtel has survived frequent policy changes in one of the world’s toughest telecommunications markets. It lost its position as India’s largest wireless carrier last year to Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which debuted in 2016 and shook up the industry with free calls and cheap data. The most recent blow to Bharti Airtel came in October, when the nation’s top court in a shock ruling ordered it to pay $3 billion in back fees.

The technology ambitions of Ambani, Asia’s richest man, have turned the spotlight on his telecommunications rivals, including Vodafone Idea Ltd., the struggling Indian business of British operator Vodafone Group Plc. The Financial Times reported May 28 that Alphabet Inc.’s Google is considering acquiring a stake in that venture. Vodafone Idea said it isn’t currently considering any such proposal.

Besides telecommunications, Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises has businesses spanning insurance, real estate, education and farm food.

Growing the number of customers that activate and use Direct Carrier Billing (DCB), a one-click method of charging purchases to the user’s mobile phone bill, is a powerful way for operators to capture more value from the consumption of ""OTT"" content and services, for example from app stores.

Using Bango technology, the du customers who wanted to spend in the Google Play store using carrier billing were identified, and targeted with a DCB re-engagement message. This enabled the customer to activate DCB within a pre-approved credit limit. The risk was that the customers who could not pay on their du phone bill would switch to a non-DCB payment method, losing the benefits of one-click payment, and reducing the percentage of du subscribers that enrol to use carrier billing. Within two weeks of launching the campaign, 20% of the segment had re-engaged and made at least one purchase with carrier billing.

Baseil Zaki, Head of Value Added Services, Devices & Loyalty, du Consumer Services commented:""du works hard to enhance and expand the services we offer our customers, providing the best experience across a range of leading OTT services. Bango is a long term, trusted partner du uses to power these services, which include Google Play and Amazon Prime. The success we have experienced with the latest Bango technology is significant, we are excited to apply this technology to activate and grow new audiences for our mobile commerce offerings.""

Jim Plimmer, SVP Payment Products Strategy and Sales at Bango commented:""Bango technology combines payment data insights with smart marketing technology to enable mobile operators and merchants to get the right message, to the right user, at the right time. This combination provides a powerful route to attract and grow the active user base.""

354,2020-05-19T02:22:52+00:00,"Sony, Microsoft Strike Deal on Tiny AI Chip With Huge Potential","(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have partnered to embed artificial intelligence capabilities into the Japanese company’s latest imaging chip, a big boost for a camera product the electronics giant describes as a world-first for commercial customers.

The new module’s big advantage is that it has its own processor and memory built in, which allows it to analyze video using AI tech like Microsoft’s Azure, but in a self-contained system that’s faster, simpler and more secure to operate than existing methods.

The two companies are appealing to retail and logistics businesses with potential uses like optimizing warehouse and factory automation, quantifying the flow of customers through stores and making cars smarter about their drivers and environment.

At a time of increasing public surveillance to help rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus, this new smart camera also has the potential to offer more privacy-conscious monitoring. And should its technology be adapted for personal devices, it even holds promise for advancing mobile photography.

Instead of generating actual images, Sony’s AI chip can analyze the video it sees and provide just metadata about what’s in front of it -- saying instead of showing what’s in its frame of vision. Because no data is sent to remote servers, opportunities for hackers to intercept sensitive images or video are dramatically reduced, which should help allay privacy fears.

Apple Inc. has already proven the efficacy of combining AI and imaging to create more secure systems with its Face ID biometric authentication, powered by the iPhone’s custom-designed Neural Engine processor. Huawei Technologies Co. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google also have dedicated AI silicon in their smartphones to assist with image processing. These on-device chips represent what’s known as edge computing: handling complex AI and machine-learning tasks at the so-called edge of the network instead of sending data back and forth to servers.

Story continues

“We are aware many companies are developing AI chips and it’s not like we try to make our AI chip better than others,” said Hideki Somemiya, senior general manager of Sony’s System Solutions group. “Our focus is on how we can distribute AI computing across the system, taking cost and efficiency into consideration. Edge computing is a trend, and in that respect, ours is the edge of the edge.”

Sony’s advance is to eliminate the need for transfers within the device itself. Whereas Apple and Google still use conventional image sensors that convert light particles into computer-readable image formats for their chips to read, Sony’s new part is capable of doing the analytical work without any data leaving its physical boundaries.

The AI-capable sensor may also help advance augmented reality applications. The two U.S. giants, whose iOS and Android operating systems control practically the entire smartphone market, are heavily invested in AR development. Google Maps now offers the option to show 3-D directions atop a video feed of a user’s surroundings while Apple is planning new 3-D cameras on its next set of iPhones in the fall. The agenda-setters of the mobile industry are looking for ever smarter mobile cameras, spurring the demand for more sophisticated imaging gear.

Sony already enjoys a substantial lead as the world’s foremost provider of image sensors, counting Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and every major Chinese smartphone maker among its customers along with pro camera stalwarts like Hasselblad V, Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Nikon Corp.

Its next set of customers may be automakers.

The AI-powered Sony sensor is capable of recording high-resolution video and simultaneously conducting its AI analysis at up to 30 frames each second. That rapid, up-to-the-microsecond responsiveness makes it potentially suitable for in-car use such as detecting when a driver is falling asleep, Sony’s Somemiya said. Without the need for a “cloud brain” as some existing systems have, Sony’s AI sensor could hasten the adoption of smart-car technology.

”This on-chip approach enables a system design to be more flexible and even optimized, given that the cost of image processing, which is one of the most compute-intensive tasks for autonomous driving, can be offloaded from an electronic control unit,” said Shinpei Kato, founder and chief technology officer of Tokyo-based Tier IV Inc., which develops self-driving software.

355,2020-05-14T14:37:51+00:00,Zoom Shot to Coronavirus Fame But It’s Got Company,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- These days, someone proposing a remote meeting or virtual happy hour is very likely to say, “Let’s Zoom.” While the coronavirus-induced lockdown has made Zoom Video Communications Inc. synonymous with video calls, it has also created a broader market, and whet investor appetite for stocks well placed to profit from the move to working from home.

Pexip Holding ASA has satisfied some of that demand with Europe’s biggest technology initial public offering this year. The Thursday listing valued the Oslo-based company at some 9 billion Norwegian krone ($880 million) – not shabby for a business with just 370 million krone in revenue last year.

The company is trading at a discount to its bigger, better-known competitor. If Pexip grows at the same pace for the rest of this year as it did in the first quarter, and profitability is consistent with previous years, then the listing gives it an enterprise value of more than 70 times forward Ebitda (a measure of a company's operating performance). Zoom is considerably pricier, with a valuation on the same basis of more than 370 times.

If this were primarily a classic consumer-facing market, then investors would have to weigh up the prospect of a winner-takes-all battle. After all, that’s how things have tended to pan out for online services: Alphabet Inc.’s Google took search, Facebook Inc. dominates social media, Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn has professional contacts and so on. And Zoom has already entered the lexicon as a verb in much the same way as google or tweet.

But the video-conferencing business model differs from those advertising-driven offerings: Most of the money is to be made from companies paying for premium services. Chief technology officers care less about what’s in vogue than about the best solution for their needs from both a technical and cost perspective. So while Pexip’s valuation is still punchy, there is room for multiple players. Concentrating on a business-to-business solution is far more likely to build a sustainable concern built on rational purchases — Pexip already boasts customers such as Vodafone Group Plc, General Electric Co. and Accenture Plc and annual recurring revenue from multi-year contracts jumped 50% in the first quarter. With 1.1 billion krone in IPO proceeds, it now has capital to accelerate that pace of growth.

Story continues

There’s significant demand to capitalize on the work-from-home trend. Shares in TeamViewer AG, a German maker of software that facilitates remote working, have climbed 33% this year, while the benchmark DAX Index has fallen 22%. Even at enterprise software giant SAP SE, Chief Executive Officer Christian Klein told Bloomberg News this week he’d love to have a video-conferencing solution in the company’s portfolio right now.

Pexip must do a lot to justify its valuation, which prices in a huge increase in earnings over the next few years. It may be telling that many of its investors are using the offering as an opportunity to sell their stakes: The company will have a free float of some 80% of the share capital. Perhaps they’re sensing an opportunity to make hay while the sun shines. But if work from home is here to stay, then there will likely be plenty of seats around the (dining room) table.

356,2020-05-12T10:43:29+00:00,Not Just Fun And Games: How Esports Could Offer Potential Investment Opportunities,"Like to play Fortnite or League of Legends? You’re in good company, because esports have become hugely popular. And esports investing and esports stocks have benefited.

Gaming and esports have grown rapidly—driven by consumer demand, new distribution strategies, and new technology, according to research firm GlobalData. Gaming has transformed into a service model rather than just a product model. As that interest has grown, so has interest in esports investing.

Like everything else, esports have been affected by the sudden, global spread of the novel coronavirus. ESPN.com reported that dozens of live esports tournaments, such as Dota Pro Circuit, have been canceled or postponed indefinitely. Some events that were supposed to be held in stadiums, such as League of Legends, have moved online to support social distancing guidelines.

The Meteoric Rise of Esports

Before the global outbreak of COVID-19, games and esports analytics firm Newzoo forecast that global esports would top $1 billion in 2020 for the first time, with China being the top market and North America close behind. That’s an estimated year-on-year growth of 15.7% for 2020. The firm has yet to update those figures, but they’ll likely change.

At the time, China was expected to be the largest market by revenue, with total revenues of $385.1 million in 2020, followed by North America, with total revenues of $252.8 million, the firm estimated.

Industry watchers will wait and see how the cancellations of some games and the move to put other tournaments online will affect the business. Online platforms such as Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and YouTube, owned by Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), are making it easier for people to consume esports videos and events by allowing esports streamers to broadcast gameplay, according to Influencer Marketing Hub. The firm cited data from TwitchTracker, which shows Twitch has seen an increase in the number of people who watch live streams on the platform—rising to 1.28 million in 2019 from 591,809 in 2016.

Story continues

MarTech Series, citing a late March report by GlobalData, sees streaming platforms benefiting from this push to online viewing. Brands that advertise during esports games—such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)—and have hosted esports events for years will likely increase their online ad buys and shift some of the ad spending they could have done at in-person tournaments. That shift in support might benefit the streaming platforms, while the organizers of these games may see their ad revenues fall sharply.

Before the virus outbreak, consulting group McKinsey & Co. noted that brands such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) were getting into core sponsorship. Advertisers have discovered that esports could be an even more attractive branding medium than traditional sports thanks to the interactivity of livestreaming. McKinsey noted that so far, there are few ads, so there’s not too much competition. Streamers are willing to wear, consume, and endorse sponsors’ products while broadcasting.

Depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it’s possible that the media rights these platforms buy from organizers could rise sharply in coming years. So these platforms may try to strike long-term deals with event organizers, GlobalData explained.

How to Invest in Esports

Even though COVID-19 has upended the sector, gaming doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. There are a few ways to invest in esports, whether directly in esports stocks or ETFs, or indirectly through technology firms or brands big in the space.

Citing data from the third quarter of 2019, Newzoo said that the top 10 public companies by games revenue made a combined $21.5 billion, which is a year-on-year growth of 7.5%, slightly higher than the growth rate in the first half of 2019. However, it was under the 11% growth rate seen year-over-year.

Newzoo said the companies that saw the greatest year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2019 included GOOGL, Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), Tencent Holdings, Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTWO). TTWO saw 74% year-over-year growth, with revenues rising to nearly $1 billion. It was the third quarter’s fastest grower, while growth numbers for GOOGL and AAPL over the past 12 months through the quarter were 28% and 16%, respectively.

GlobalData reported that much of the innovation is coming through companies involved in 5G, cloud gaming, and the artificial reality/virtual reality space. Many semiconductor companies have hands in those high-growth interrelated areas, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX). And don’t forget cloud computing platforms. In addition to AMZN and GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a significant platform.

In the March report reflecting the pandemic’s impact, GlobalData pointed out that online viewership of esports tournaments has grown significantly. The research firm cited information supplied by Gen.G that it saw an 18% increase in viewership for its PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and League of Legends teams on Chinese streaming platforms in early 2020, when the Chinese government locked down most of the country.

Whether it be exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds, the Oracle of Omaha believes Vanguard funds are the way to go. With that in mind, I’ve put together a portfolio of two ETFs, two mutual funds and a fifth wildcard. The resulting portfolio should be appropriate for Buffett’s wife — or anyone else, for that matter.

Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX)

Allocation: 50% of Portfolio
10-Year Performance: 10.49%

The goal is to keep costs to a minimum while generally sticking to Buffett’s hypothesis when it comes to his wife’s investments. Although Vanguard does offer commission-free ETFs, I recommend a mutual fund for the S&P 500 investment.

The Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VFIAX) charges an annual expense ratio of just 0.04%, or $4 on a $10,000 investment.

Your annual fees would amount to a mere $20 on a $50,000 portfolio. That’s hard to beat, and Buffett knows it. The largest holdings in this fund include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The minimum investment is $3,000.

Allocation: 20% of Portfolio 10-Year Performance: 9.94%

The VFIAX covers the large-capitalization portion of the portfolio quite nicely.

While Buffett might not be fond of mid-cap stocks being added to the mix, evidence suggests mid-caps outperformed large-cap stocks over a four-year period between 2009 and 2013.

In fact, John Hancock published a report cautioning investors about underweighting mid-caps because of an assumption that a large-cap fund combined with a small-cap fund will do the job. That’s simply not the case.

Mid-cap stocks tend to provide an attractive combination of risk and reward. For this reason, I recommend the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX), which tracks the CRSP Mid Cap Index, an index composed of stocks that fall between the top 70%-85% of investable market capitalization.

They’re big enough to survive an economic hit but small enough to still be growing. With an expense ratio of 0.05%, this entry on our list of Vanguard funds is giving you safety and performance in one. Top holdings include Newmont (NYSE:NEM), Centene (NYSE:CNC) and TransDigm (NYSE:TDG).

Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (VSS)</b> Take Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy

Allocation: 10% of Portfolio 10-Year Performance: 6.67%

Although I just said mid-cap stocks are a key part of any portfolio and tend to outperform small-caps while utilizing less risk, there is always a place for small-caps in your portfolio.

That’s especially true when the two previous picks from Vanguard Funds are almost 100% invested in the U.S. with virtually no international exposure. For this reason, a little bit of love outside America makes total sense.

My recommendation is to go with the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:VSS), a fund that tracks the performance of the FTSE Global Small Cap ex US Index, which consists of over 3,000 stocks in dozens of countries. Investing in both developed and emerging markets, the fund provides good exposure to some of the world’s future stars at an annual expense ratio of just 0.12%.

With such low fees, it’s no wonder  $6.8 billion is invested in this ETF.

Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)</b> Take Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy

Allocation: 10% of Portfolio  5-Year Performance: 1.33%

Buffett recommends that 10% of his wife’s portfolio go to short-term government bonds. Vanguard Funds has an ETF that does exactly that.

The Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (NASDAQ:VGSH) invests in investment-grade U.S. government bonds with average maturities between one and three years. The risk, on a scale of one to five, is one — meaning this Vanguard ETF is for conservative investors looking for stable share prices.

And with an expense ratio of 0.05%, this ETF should give you peace of mind for your short-term needs.

Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC)</b>

Allocation: 10% of Portfolio  10-Year Performance: 10.67%

On this final piece of the puzzle, I’m going defensive. The mutual fund version of the S&P 500 has less than 10% invested in consumer staples. I mean to remedy that by putting the final 10% in the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC), a collection of 92 household names including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).

Since its inception in 2004, VDC has had but one year of negative annual total returns, and that was in 2008 when it experienced a 17% decline — 20 percentage points better than the S&P 500. When the you-know-what hits the fan, you’ll be glad you own this particular low-cost ETF. It has an expense ratio of just 0.10%.

It seems the “keep it simple” rule holds true, and Warren Buffett is the No. 1 follower.

As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not own a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

358,2020-04-27T17:28:42+00:00,Why nobody on Wall Street really cares that Apple is reportedly delaying new iPhone releases,"If you’re Apple (AAPL), it pays to have gobs of cash and a gazillion plugged in sell-side analysts obsessively covering your stock. That’s especially so right now amidst a global health pandemic that has crushed the global economy and has made buying a new $1,000-plus iPhone sometime this year seem silly (if not financially impossible for many).

Shares of the tech behemoth barely budged on Monday following a story in the Wall Street Journal that Apple would push back the production of its latest iPhones by roughly a month. Apple typically releases several new handsets in the fall just before the holiday shopping season.

The company is reportedly working on four new iPhones for release this year, some with 5G capability.

Two Apple spokesmen didn’t return Yahoo Finance’s request for comment on the WSJ report.

At first blush, one would think news of a delay of any kind for fresh iPhones would be negative to Apple’s stock price. Not necessarily for a few reasons, strategists say.

First, a delay in the production ramp has been discussed at length on Wall Street and factored into a good chunk of profit estimates on Apple and the stock. Apple shares are down about 4% year-to-date, lagging the gains in other Big Cap tech stocks such as Microsoft (+10%), Amazon (+30%) and Netflix (+30%).

“This is right in line with our and many Street expectations with 5G slated to hit in late November/early December pre holidays,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

More important is that Apple is still — apparently — planning to have its new iPhones in the market before the critical holiday shopping season. By then, many would agree the U.S. economy will be in far better shape than it is today and interest in buying a new iPhone higher.

“This is something that was expected. The going thought is we push it forward or back a little bit [iPhone production]. That still gives people enough time to purchase devices for the important holiday season,” explained Futurum Research founder Daniel Newman on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Story continues Rows of iPhones are displayed Saturday, March 14, 2020, inside a closed Apple store in downtown Brooklyn in New York.

In the meantime, while major production delays would cripple the finances of most manufacturers, Apple is not a normal manufacturer. It’s a tech beast selling hardware that generates real-time money through various services and downloads. In turn, sell-side analysts estimate Apple will produce nearly $60 billion in free cash flow this year. That will easily allow Apple to fund a solid dividend and steady stream of profit-cushioning stock buybacks.

Apple ended its fiscal year (year ended Dec. 28) with more than $107 billion in cash and short-term investments.

“With a company with that much cash on their balance sheet, they are in a strong position to weather volatility,” notes Apple bull and chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments Victoria Fernandez.

And weather production delays, too.

Yahoo Finance’s Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the details. Howley also discusses Apple's potential plans to delay production on its newest iPhone.

Video Transcript

BRIAN SOZZI: Switching gears, Amazon is taking new steps to verify third party sellers. The e-commerce giant is testing the use of video calls to validate the seller's identity. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins us now to break it down. Dan, why wasn't Amazon doing this before?

DAN HOWLEY: I think they really just wanted kind of face-to-face interactions rather than a video interaction, but now that COVID has, obviously, everyone homebound, or at least preventing people from being able to meet in person, they're doing this video style. They had been piloting this before. They were using it in months prior, so this is something that they're continuing to use, and it's basically a way for them to vet sellers that are using the platform-- third-party sellers-- to ensure that what they're actually offering are legitimate products.

Now we've seen, obviously, investigations by various outlets showing-- I think particularly ""The Wall Street Journal""-- showed that they were offering some unsafe items, particularly children's toys with lead-based paint. There's obviously been an issue as well with the likes of Apple and Nike taking issue with the fact that there are fraudulent products sold through Amazon bearing their name. So now Nike doesn't even sell through Amazon as result. So this is a way for them to try to make sure that this is all kind of borne out, that they vet the people that are selling through their platform, and they can avoid any unfortunate issues with other companies disputing the fact that they may have fraudulent items or, more importantly, that items themselves are safe.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Hey, I want to switch gears for a minute here, Dan, and talk about Apple. I'm sure you saw this story in ""The Wall Street Journal"" this morning saying that the company is going to have to push back mass production of its flagship iPhone this year because of the pandemic. How much should investors be worried about that, given the fact that the iPhone makes up such a huge chunk of Apple's revenue?

Story continues

DAN HOWLEY: It's interesting, because, you know, we've seen reports saying that this was likely to happen for some time now. Most analysts I've spoken to-- particularly Dan Ives at Wedbush basically saying, look. It's more likely than not going to be delayed. We haven't heard anything, though, about the actual launch-- the launch event that they usually have in September. But if there's still lockdowns going on in September, that's not going to happen. And if there's still military hospitals set up in the country, that's probably not going to happen either. They would push it out a little longer.

I think for analysts and investors, this is something, as I said, was expected. The going thought now is, OK. So we push it forward a little bit or back a little bit. That's still gives people enough time to purchase these devices for the important holiday season. And as you go through the iPhone cell cycle, you'll have Q1-- you have the tail end of Q4, and Q2 where a lot of sales really happen. It's really just the end of Q4 there, though, when the new iPhones come out.

So the older phones start to phase out around Q3 and the bulk of Q4, and then we go back into the cycle. So it seems like they would still have the devices on store shelves for the tail-- the very tail end of Q4, Q1, Q2, and then into Q3.

HEIDI CHUNG: Hey, Dan, it's Heidi here. So a pretty busy week for you. We have a lot of those large cap tech names reporting. We just talked about Apple, but I want to get what The Wall Street analysts here are expecting when it comes to Microsoft, Amazon, a couple of those other names that you closely follow.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think for the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, Google, a lot of what we're going to be talking about is obviously cloud usage. We talked about how AWS had seen a surge. Azure from Microsoft likely saw a surge as well as Google's cloud platform. Any of these cloud companies are really taking a lot of traffic and as a result of so many people working from home and so many operations now having to be done remotely.

So I think we'll hear a lot about that. And don't forget, you know, these companies don't just provide services for businesses as far as B2B work. They also host platforms like Netflix, so they are going to see a ton of increased traffic, and that will probably bode very well for them. But then you have to think, OK, if the economy starts to slow down, Capex spending from companies will start to slow down, and that may translate into these companies saying, look. Down the line, we might not have the kinds of profits that we were expecting as a result of our cloud platforms simply because other companies aren't signing up for new contracts because they just don't have the bandwidth for it right now.

But I think for the coming quarters, we're going to see gangbusters stuff from them. Microsoft, on the other hand, with their hardware side, probably not. And Google as well. I think it's going to be harder for product side at this point.

360,2020-04-27T10:47:43+00:00,Coronavirus unleashes insane bubble in these 5 stocks and it could end badly for the bulls,"This market rally may be as fake as some of the bootleg hand sanitizers being hawked on Amazon and eBay at crazy prices to the worried quarantined masses.

Despite 26.45 million Americans having filed for unemployment claims the past five weeks and first quarter earnings season so far being as painful as being forced to watch “Tiger King” for the third time, the S&P 500 has rallied about 27% from the March 23 lows. The S&P 500’s forward price to earnings multiple of 21 times or so is at its highest level since right before the tech bubble back in December 2001.

Insane.

One would think we are amidst a solid economic expansion in the U.S. and accelerating EPS growth among businesses, not something as debilitating as the coronavirus pandemic.

“All the data is horrific. But it’s getting less bad than it was say a couple weeks ago and that’s especially true with jobless claims. So markets are focused on that marginal rate of change and and they think that the worst will be behind us when we move to May and June,” said Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Point well taken.

But the question right now the bulls should be asking themselves is how strong is the rally from the March lows, really? Are the bulls truly buying into the view the U.S. economy is back to its job creating, growth self this summer? Or, is the rally a mirage being fueled by heavy-hitting speculators (we see you, hedge funds) going back to tried and true winning trades in big cap tech? And in turn, this is creating the momentum that lures in the suckers just before the bottom drops out of the entire market again.

The data supports the latter observation.

The five big cap tech stocks

Coming into 2020, the five largest S&P 500 stocks comprised 18% of its market cap, matching the share at the peak of the tech bubble in March 2000, Goldman Sachs strategists note. Since then, those stocks — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook — have risen to account for 20% of the S&P 500’s market cap.

Story continues The statue of the charging bull is pictured on April 20, 2020 in New York City. - Wall Street opened lower on Monday as traders grappled with a drop in oil prices to 22-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic sapped demand for energy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 percent to 23,798.01 about 10 minutes into the trading session.The broad-based S&P 500 had declined 1.3 percent to 2,835.08, while the tech-rich Nasdaq had fallen 0.7 percent to 8,588.66. (Photo by Johannes EISELE / AFP) (Photo by JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images)

Looked at another way, all five of those big cap tech stocks have handily outperformed the S&P 500’s 14% drop, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data — led by a 30% pop in Amazon. In effect, investors have pretty much forgotten about the other 495 stocks in the benchmark index because they have less belief in their ability to navigate the coronavirus situation for whatever reason.

A healthy market rally, however, would be under-pinned by a belief that more than five companies will successfully come out the other side. Where are the bets in industrial names? How about taking a stab at battered oil stocks — if the economy is going to burst back into gear later this year, surely we will need greater oil than the present right?

“Many market participants – ourselves included – have expressed incredulity at the fact that the S&P 500 trades just 17% below its all-time high amid the largest economic shock in nearly a century. Below the surface of the market, however, the median S&P 500 constituent trades 28% below its record high. This 11 percentage point gap is one measure of market breadth, which now stands roughly a standard deviation below its historical average,” the Goldman Sachs equities strategy team writes.

Such narrow breadth in the market comes with a warning from Goldman, as it should.

Says Goldman, “In addition to the Tech Bubble, breadth narrowed ahead of the recessions in 1990 and 2008 and the economic slowdowns of 2011 and 2016. Historically, sharply narrowing breadth has signaled below-average 1-, 3-, and 6- month S&P 500 returns as well as larger-than-average prospective drawdowns.”

And who is to say Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are worthy of their even more premium current valuations? None of these companies have reported first quarter earnings yet.

You mean to tell me 26.45 million jobless Americans doesn’t equate to reduced spending on cloud computing upgrades this year (it does)? A severe economic downturn in the U.S. like we are experiencing doesn’t mean sharply lower consumer spending (it has already, per retail sales data) and downside financial risk for Amazon? Small businesses going under will pressure advertising on Facebook.

The market will do what it wants to do in the end. What’s right though is a pause in the upward momentum in stocks, especially five enormous tech stocks.

361,2020-04-24T19:48:22+00:00, Facebook to debut free video chat service,"Facebook announced on Friday that it will introduce a free video chatting service amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley and Seana Smith break down the details.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Dan, I want to hear your thoughts on an announcement that we just got from Facebook earlier in the hour, earlier this afternoon. They actually announced today that a free video calling feature for up to 50 people. And of course, when you look at that announcement, you immediately think of, maybe this is a potential Zoom competitor. What are the details of this announcement, and could it potentially take some market share, or take some business away from Zoom?

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, it's interesting because there's-- so there's two ways to look at this. Zoom has been exposed, as far as having its own security lapses and privacy lapses. Facebook, that's a given now. So it'll be interesting to see how people balance those.

This feature will give you up to 50 people at once in video chat, that's nowhere near what Facebook originally offered, and it's free. There's no time limit or anything along those lines. With Zoom, you can get 100 people, but you're limited to 40 minutes per call. So that's huge for Facebook coming out with this messenger service.

But what I think is more interesting, and isn't as highlighted as much, is the fact that WhatsApp is doubling from four people on video chat to eight. Now why is that important? Because WhatsApp offers end to end encryption for video calling. So if you're very concerned about privacy, having your chats potentially get out, that's what you want to use, is something with end to end encryption.

Zoom doesn't offer that. They said they did, but they absolutely do not yet. And Facebook Messenger doesn't have that as well for those video chats. So I would look for something like WhatsApp to be your source for really secure and protected video.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it's interesting. We'll see how it rises in popularity.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: So for more on today's market, I want to bring in Keith Fitzgerald, chief investment strategist at Money Map Pricing. Keith, help me make sense of what's going on in the markets. What do you think investors are focusing on at this point?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, this is actually a good type of market action right now. It's a little bit muted for what I'd like to see at this stage of the recovery, but the narrative has shifted from doom and gloom to positive to what's going to happen when we come out of this. Psychologically, that's very important. Financially, that's very important. Because the support you're seeing key among sectors, you know, tech, medicine, some of those types of things.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, what do you-- what are investors, or how are they making sense of what we saw in the oil market, the turmoil recently in oil? How do you think investors are digesting that, and how is that affecting their outlook here, at least for the short term?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, I tell you, there's sort of two answers to that. The first is, is the world of high finance. It's not readily apparent to the average investor because what happened was largely a technical screw-up in the futures markets. As that affects our markets, oil, what that really says is there's simply too much of it going around. So if you went to the service station to take a drive, and service station would be paying you to fill your car up.

But again, even that's not so bad because when the recovery hits, there's plenty of gas available. That means consumers are going to benefit. As we go and we start running around and spending money, that's going to be a good narrative.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, it's interesting. When we focus on today's market move in the S&P, the range today was less than 1%. It's the lowest that we have seen since the all-time high that we hit back in February. What do you think-- are you reading into this at all, and do you expect us to be range bound here, maybe at least for the short term?

Story continues

KEITH FITZGERALD: Actually, no, I think the computers are building up energy to figure out what's going to happen next. Investors are trying to figure out whether we're going to revisit the lows or run to new highs. The answer to that is not yet seen, but what we do see, this is technically called compression. And when we get this type of phenomenon, we know the market is building up energy to move.

Now the president has made it very clear which way he wants to see things go. The Fed has made it very clear which way they want to see things go. Now it's all up to the traders and the sentiment. I think it's going to push higher, but we're going to have a little bit of turmoil coming into next week.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, what do you think investors are focusing on, just in terms of why there's still so much optimism in the market? Because I know you're saying that you expect markets to continue to push higher, but when you drill down into some of that economic data that we got out this week, it just simply does not look good.

We had that consumer sentiment number out this morning falling in April, that jobless claims number out yesterday, 4.4 million more people filing for unemployment. How are investors able to kind of wrap their heads around this and put it on the backburner and move on?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, funny enough, this is one of the few areas where individual investors have the advantage, watching professionals have to continually cycle money through the markets, which means they have to keep it moving. Individual investors can concentrate on CEOs, on the best companies with a clear path to profit, those that have huge piles of cash, and they can pick and choose very carefully.

So I actually, the folks I'm talking to around the world are very, very calm, believe it or not. Because they understand the CEOs have to play this game, regardless of what happens in the markets themselves. That, to me, is a source of profits and optimism.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, when you're taking a look at the market right now, what looks attractive to you? What are you buying?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, there's certain tech companies, for example, Micron and Nvidia that are critical. The coronavirus actually improves their bottom line a quarter or two from now. I'm very keen on other companies. You know, Apple, for example, earnings is coming out on Microsoft. Those are a lot of the companies I'm watching very, very closely because they have the potential to ride right through this and strong enough balance sheets to do it.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, you just mentioned earnings there. What are your thoughts on what we've seen so far? Because this week, we had just around a fifth of the companies in S&P 500 early reporting earnings. From what we've gotten this week, what do you think that tells us about what lies ahead for earnings season?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, you know, I'm less concerned about the earnings themselves because it's kind of like betting on a horse race after you know the results. You know, Wall Street is going to have to do its homework. I think yanking guidance, as some of the companies have done.

But the big thing, to me, the critical takeaway is that we've seen a number of companies report solid numbers. So that says to me that not everything is broken, that we will get through this, and again, being an optimist at heart and in my capacity as chief investment strategist, I don't have the luxury of being right or wrong. What I have to do is look for the profitability, and again, that is a good takeaway for me.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, I was reading through your notes, and the one thing that stuck out to me was what you said about the retail sector and how you've remained very concerned by the tsunami of retail failures ahead. What do you mean by that, and what do you think the broader implications of this could be?

KEITH FITZGERALD: You know, this is really, if there's a negative here, it's millions of investors have been hurt. Millions of people are out of work. The retail sector, you've got Neiman Marcus, Gap. You've got other retailers who maybe are not going to be able to pay their rent, certainly not going to be able to pay their employees. I think we're going to have a huge number of stores that are going to go out of business, never to return again.

That has implications for shopping space, for malls, for office rentals. There's a lot of blowback that we haven't yet accounted for I think remain ahead. So that, to me, is the real negative here.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, real quick, on monetary and fiscal policies that have been put in place over the last couple of months trying to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, do you think they go far enough? And do you think that we'll need some more aggressive action from either the Fed or from Congress?

KEITH FITZGERALD: Well, I'll tell you what. I wish I was smart enough to figure that out. It strikes me as, you know, if we come out of this, if we really get a path to recovery, we start opening the country. And you know what? It's probably OK.

But if we have to extend the lockdown for any reason, if we have to stay in our homes, we have to shelter in place, and we get a secondary infection blown, then I don't think it is enough. I think we're going to have to have more extreme action, as unthinkable as that is.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Keith Fitzgerald of Money Map Press, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.

If you find yourself in the enviable position of being able to ponder how to invest your stimulus check, thank your lucky stars ... for plenty of reasons.

As you're well aware by now, the $2 trillion CARES Act rescue package included stimulus checks of up to $1,200 for most individuals living in the U.S. The sad reality is, many Americans will need every cent of that for day-to-day basics. But more than a few people are fortunate enough to be able to put that money to work. Anecdotally, a few friends have already asked me about how to invest their recently deposited stimulus checks. And more people are sure to wonder the same as the Treasury proceeds with its disbursements.

The good news? Despite how ugly the market looks right now - in many cases, because the market looks so ugly right now - you've got options. And plenty of 'em.

Today, we're going to look at how to invest your stimulus check. Because everyone's risk tolerance is a little different, we'll be exploring a variety of options - conservative, aggressive and a little in between.

A Good Ol' Broad Market Index Fund

Especially if you're a novice investor, one of the best things you can do with your stimulus check is to plunk it down into a boring index fund.

Back in 2008, near the depths of the last bear market, Knight Kiplinger wrote to readers, ""Why I'm Buying Stocks."" What did he buy on discount? Everything. ""I invested in virtually the entire universe of U.S. publicly traded companies, through a ""total market"" index fund,"" he wrote. ""This gives me a sliver of some 2,500 companies, large and small, in every corner of American business - everyday consumer products, heavy manufacturing, technology, energy, health care, food and agriculture, and yes, even housing and financial services, the most-shunned stocks of all. I'm not sure which of these sectors will fare better than the others, so I hedged my bets by buying all of them.""

Story continues

I know. It's a boring, unsatisfying suggestion. Scroll down if you want to get to the exciting stuff.

But if you're looking to put money to work right away, and you're inexperienced with researching stocks, plain ol' index funds can give you access to a wide range of stocks - typically for minimal fees. Stocks, at least for now, are well off their nadir, but you'd still be buying on a considerable dip right now. The S&P 500, for instance, is down about 15% year-to-date and roughly 19% off its all-time highs.

A straightforward suggestion is an S&P 500 tracking fund such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) or SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG), both of which charge just 0.03%, or $3 for every $10,000 invested, each year to own.

But there are other ways to ""buy the market."" The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), for instance, holds 3,535 stocks, spread across large-, mid- and even small-cap companies. The fund is cap-weighted, meaning that each stock's weight is determined by its market cap, meaning that most of its weight is in the same stocks VOO and SPLG hold. But you get a little more exposure to the ""growthier"" small companies that trade on U.S. exchanges.

If you're worried that the S&P 500 is too top-heavy - Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) make up nearly 20% of the index's weight - you can try the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). This fund invests in each S&P 500 stock at the same weight every quarter when the fund rebalances. Do you want more of these tech giants? Consider the Invesco QQQ Portfolio (QQQ), which invests in the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the Nasdaq; those aforementioned technology companies make up nearly 45% of the portfolio!

Dividend Aristocrats and Other ""Bulletproof"" Blue Chips

Getty Images

Wall Street analysts and other market experts generally agree the economy, earnings and the stock market are in for short-term pain. Where they diverge is how soon everything will pick back up again.

That unknown makes all the difference in the world. It's one thing to survive a quarter or two with considerably diminished profits. It's another to, say, survive amid rolling quarantines through mid-2021 or persistently low unemployment even after restrictions are lifted because many Americans continue to shut themselves in until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.

If you want to invest your stimulus check while hedging against a bad-case scenario, your best equity bets are big, blue-chip stocks with bulletproof balance sheets. Companies that are low on debt and high on cash and investments, and that can generate cash even as business slows, are more likely to survive. More importantly, they offer numerous other advantages:

They're in a position to gain market share on lesser-capitalized competitors. They're in a position to continue marketing, researching and developing products and services, setting themselves up for growth on the other end of a recession. They're in a position to make transformative M&A moves as acquisition targets get cheaper.

Income investors have another reason to target these kinds of companies: They're more likely to continue delivering regular cash dividends. Dozens of firms have been forced to cut or suspend their dividends, leaving retirees - many of whom rely on those payouts to tackle their regular expenses - in the lurch.

If income is a priority, consider browsing the ranks of the Dividend Aristocrats: S&P 500 companies that have increased their dividends without interruption for at least 25 years. That means their payouts have already survived two bear markets (2007-09 and 2000-02), and in many cases, several more.

Most of these companies have the means to keep their payouts intact. And even the members that are struggling the most are moving heaven and earth to remain in the club. Take Chevron (CVX), for example. In the face of perilously low oil prices, CEO Michael Wirth called the dividend Chevron's ""No. 1 priority"" - and CVX is cutting buybacks and even capital expenditures just to keep its payout intact.

Chevron (or any other energy stock, for that matter) might be too speculative for some tastes. That's OK: The Aristocrats include many other stocks with more stable outlooks.

Work-From-Home Stocks

Call them ""work-from-home"" stocks, ""stay-at-home"" stocks or ""social distancing"" stocks ...

... but don't call them a fad.

Web conferencing. Collaboration software. Home health. Streaming media. Yes, some of these stocks have become overheated in the short-term - think Zoom Communications (ZM, +150% year-to-date) and Teladoc Health (TDOC, +123%) - as investors look for anything that's growing while the economy is shrinking. But while they might cool down in the wake of an eventual ""reopening"" of the economy, the future is in their favor.

This forced work-from-home experiment has demonstrated that some organizations can indeed function, and function well, with most if not all of their employees working full-time from home. While many Americans are likely to trickle back into the office as restrictions are gradually lifted, expect the growth of regular remote working to accelerate now that more employees have enjoyed some of the benefits (such as the time and money saved by not commuting) - and as employers realize the potential cost savings of smaller office spaces.

This trend should be a boon not just for firms that facilitate this kind of work, but other companies that offer digital convenience, including e-commerce and telehealth firms.

You could invest some of your stimulus check in some of these individual names. But if you want to avoid single-stock risk, just wait. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Direxion has filed for a fund focused on stocks that would benefit from more virtual work, with the appropriate ticker symbol ""WFH.""

Moonshots

Getty Images

If $1,200 suddenly pops into your lap, why not use it to take a flyer on a high-risk, high-reward play? If it doesn't pan out, all you've lost is a windfall that you weren't expecting in the first place.

That doesn't mean you should go out and plunk your stimulus check on a blind gamble, of course. But there's nothing wrong with trying to generate a little alpha with an aggressive growth play - indeed, many financial professionals will tell you there's nothing wrong with allocating a little of your portfolio to the occasional moonshot.

Or, rather than growth, you could consider deep, deep value investing. Stocks in a number of industries - think casinos, cruise lines, airlines and oil production - have been driven into the ground. But a few companies that are effectively priced for disaster could very well bounce back thanks not just to an eventual economic recovery, but consolidation within their industries as the weaker players fail.

Consider the airline industry. While carriers have watched business all but dry up - Delta Air Lines (DAL), for instance, recently reported that it's burning $100 million in cash each day and estimate second-quarter revenues will decline 90% year-over-year - it's unlikely the industry will be allowed to collapse completely. It might not look the same, some carriers might be smaller and others might disappear, but the survivors could prove to be lucrative picks, much like they were following drastic declines in 2008-09.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) might be the pick of the litter. Oh, it's ugly. LUV, which has already tapped $2.3 billion from a credit line, is applying for up to $12 billion in government aid. And it's at risk of being forced to implement its first involuntary furloughs in company history.

But Southwest also has one of the best reputations among airline passengers and consumers alike, it has a value tilt, and it entered this crisis with one of the sturdiest balance sheets in the industry thanks to able management. Those are advantages you want out of any airline trying to claw its way out of this mess.

Your Fellow Man

The coronavirus outbreak is exacting a terrible economic toll on individual Americans and community businesses alike. While Washington has delivered trillions of dollars in aid - including these stimulus checks - much, much more help is needed.

If you want to help small businesses while also earning a small return, you can make traditional investments via microloans. Companies such as LendingClub (LC), Prosper and Kiva allow you to make small-dollar investments in other businesses via their platforms. LendingClub, for instance, has individual accounts that require a mere $1,000 minimum investment; with that, you can invest by lending to one company, or spread out your money across multiple firms in increments as small as $25.

What kind of returns can you expect? LendingClub provides an example that shows an average 14% interest rate for a portfolio, then backs out 8% in principal and interest losses and 1% in fees for an annualized 5% net return. Just keep your eyes open: This isn't a normal investing environment, so your results could vary considerably.

If you're less concerned about making a financial gain, you can simply inject local businesses with a little cash. Patronize local businesses through their e-commerce sites. If you use Uber Eats for takeout from your favorite local restaurant, consider their in-app button allowing you to donate extra money directly to the restaurant - and Uber will match donations (up to $3 million total) with a contribution to the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. In some cases, businesses are setting up GoFundMe, Indiegogo or other crowdfunding sites to drum up much-needed funds.

At the simplest level, you can help your fellow Americans by donating to a local or state food bank, or other charities that can help out the nation's most vulnerable at this time. If you do plan on giving, consult a charity-rating site such as Charity Navigator to ensure you're donating to an organization that will make good use of your contributions.

Kyle Woodley was long AMZN, FB, LUV, MSFT, QQQ and VOO as of this writing. He is pledging a portion of his stimulus check (whenever it arrives) to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank.

Those are the second- and fourth-largest states, respectively.

The S&P 500 fell 0.05%

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%

The Nasdaq Composite inched lower by 0.01% For the first time in awhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow’s top performer, adding 3% today.

Thursday is jobless claims today and suffice to say, the latest numbers aren’t good, but they were less bad. Last week, 4.43 million Americans applied for jobless benefits, bringing the five-week tally to a staggering 26.5 million. The prior week’s figure was also revised lower to 5.24 million. However, the problem areas include some of the largest states.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

“California reported the most initial claims last week, at an unadjusted 533,600, down from 655,500 the prior week. Florida was next, followed by Texas at 280,400, up slightly from the prior week,” reports Bloomberg.

Peak unemployment claims were probably notched a couple of weeks, but the outlook is still dismal as some economists believe the U.S. rate of joblessness is heading for 20%.

To some extent, stocks fought off that ominous prediction as 18 of 30 Dow members were higher in late trading.

Apple News

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn’t do much today despite reports that the company is aiming to sell Macs powered by in-house semiconductors next year. Reports indicate Apple will unveil at least one Mac next year with its own chips and this could be a growing theme across Apple’s product line because the company is searching for new processors as an avenue for setting itself apart from rivals.

Microsoft Rumors

Apple wasn’t the only Dow Jones tech name subject to the rumor mill today. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed slightly lower — more a testament to today’s sluggish action than anything else — amid rumors that the company is planning a big-time game reveal sometime soon. For now, it’s a rumor, but it makes sense because video game hardware makers, including Microsoft, are expected to launch new consoles later this year.

Not Reacting to Bad News

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the poster children for coronavirus equity erosion, but the stock traded modestly higher despite another day of challenging headlines. This time around, it was Standard & Poor’s downgrading Disney’s credit rating to “A-” from “A” while keeping a “negative” outlook on the rating.

“Disney’s theme parks won’t likely return to normal capacity utilization at the same rate as the overall economy even after stay-at-home restrictions are eased and the theme parks are allowed to reopen,” said the ratings agency.

Another Wild Day for Oil

Oil notched another epic rally, this time it was 20% intraday gain, helping Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) into the Dow winners circle. Speculating as to long oil upside will last is tricky, but it pays to remember this is coming against the backdrop of weak demand and poor economic data.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today

Making near-term equity market upside something of a dubious proposition is that, as FactSet points out, global economic data is slack, meaning Covid-19 is hampering more than just the U.S. and Chinese economies.

“Analysts surveyed by FactSet are now forecasting a 2.9% contraction in U.S. GDP in 2020; this compares to the 1.8% expansion predicted at the end of February,” according to the research firm. “The Eurozone economy is expected to shrink by 4.8% in 2020 while the UK is projected to see its economy contract by 4.9%. China’s GDP is expected to grow by just 2.2%, the country’s slowest GDP growth since official records began.”

365,2020-04-23T17:27:59+00:00,Investors think the coronavirus has put the US economy into another Great Depression: strategist,"It’s always next to impossible to pinpoint precisely what the stock market has priced into valuations. Although right now, equities strategists would universally agree the market has factored in two quarters of outright economic ugliness in the United States at the hands of the deadly coronavirus.

The wild cards sitting here today is how the market will react to finally receiving the economic dread it has come to expect since the health pandemic erupted in early March. And then, has the market bounced too hard from the March lows on the expectation of V-shaped economic recovery later this year that may not appear, given the realities of a post pandemic world?

“I think the expectation of market participants is that we’re in the Great Depression and that in a sense, the news can’t get much worse,” said BNY Mellon chief strategist Alicia Levine on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

To Levine’s point, it’s interesting to see the market continue to rally in the face of brutal reads on the U.S. economy. It only fuels the thesis that the bottom in the markets formed on March 23, which may be a flawed view. The latest upbeat market response arrived on Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 300 points in the face of news that another 4.427 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits.

Since mid-March, 26 million more people have applied for jobless benefits. This would mean an unemployment rate of 20.6%, per math from MUFG chief economist Chis Rupkey, who points out the rate is closing in on Great Depression levels where a quarter of all jobs are lost.

“It is going to take years not months to put these pandemic jobless workers back to work at the shops and malls and factories and restaurants across the country. What are stock market investors thinking? There's at least 33 million people out of work in the country. Investors should be running for their lives,” Rupkey contends.

Rupkey notes the stock market fell 57.7% at the worst point of the Great Depression. The S&P 500 was only down 13.3% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close of trading.

‘I would be hedging myself’

Moreover, big cap tech stocks such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Netflix continue to trade as if this was the 2019 economy, not one where a quarter of jobs in America have vanished within two months. The Nasdaq 100 to S&P 500 ratio has climbed back to 2000 dot com bubble highs, points out researchers at SunDial Capital.

At some point soon, the market could be forced into pulling off its rose-colored glasses. Sure, extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve is a major backstop to equities as history has proven again and again. But for investors to completely ignore jarring information on the economy seems absurd.

“I would be hedging myself in this marketplace. There is still a lot of uncertainty, there is an outstanding number of people that are not working right now,” says Advisorshares CEO Noah Hamman. “I’m optimistic that the economy is going to turn around. But it doesn’t mean that the stock market is going to follow along with it.”

Sounds like reasonable insight inside of a Great Depression.

366,2020-04-22T14:14:47+00:00,Seattle mayor considers reopening economy 'sector by sector',"Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she would consider a “sector by sector” approach to reopening the Puget Sound economy — if and when coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Durkan said she would weigh a business’s ability to operate remotely to determine which sectors should be allowed to return first.

“[During stay-at-home orders] we had employers who could work from home but we also had a lot of people who couldn’t. Our small businesses, our manufacturing sectors were hit a lot harder,” she said.

Businesses in the Puget Sound region —home to Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nordstrom (JWN) — have largely been limited to working from home since Washington issued its stay-at-home order on March 23rd. The restriction followed a spike in coronavirus cases in the state, where 37 of the first 50 deaths in the U.S. were reported.

But last week, Governor Jay Inslee said social distancing measures have been successful in “flattening the curve” in the the state. As of Wednesday morning, 5,379 COVID-19 cases and 372 deaths have been reported in King County.

The state’s current stay-at-home order expires on May 4, though the governor has indicated some restrictions will remain in place beyond that.

“We’re really going to have to be smart about how we open up. We know we have to do it, people want to come back together,” Durkan said. “We want an economy going, but it would be devastating to open up and then precipitously have to close again.”

A three-part plan to reopen the economy

A roadmap for reopening unveiled by Inslee Tuesday night prioritizes statewide testing and contact tracing and calls for phasing-in the reopening of certain businesses while continuing social distancing.

Inslee said the state needs to be processing between 20,000 and 30,000 tests a day for contact tracing to be effective. He’s urged the federal government to help secure additional resources.

“It will look more like a turn of the dial than a flip of the switch,” Inslee said in a public address. “We’re going to take steps and then monitor to see whether they work or if we must continue to adapt.”

Boeing resumes production

Both Inslee and Durkan stress that any reopening would be “guided by science.” But at least one major company in the region has resumed its operations.

Roughly 27,000 Boeing (BA) workers returned to commercial airplane production line this week. The company said it will stagger start times, spread-out work areas, and require face coverings, in a potential sign of what other workplaces could look like.

Durkan said Boeing was given the green light largely because it is considered an essential business for national defense.

“We open, we monitor, we watch. And if it’s not working, we take different steps,” Durkan said.

While sectors like manufacturing and construction may be among the first to see restrictions lifted, Durkan said tech companies may be among the last, in part because they are well equipped to work remotely. Alphabet’s Google (GOOG), Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook (FB) offices were among the first to begin working from home, weeks before the statewide stay-at-home order went into effect.

The logic behind this makes perfect sense - what can go wrong with building your portfolio based on all the hard work from some of the wisest people on the planet that comes free of charge to you?

In this regard, we think that investors, especially individual ones, should be selective and make sure to leverage the size advantage, if any. For instance, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has to handle several hundred billion USD in assets (including more than $100 billion in cash at the moment) via not only sizable equity stakes but also through controlling ownership and even acquisitions. Terry Smith invests his Fundsmith Equity Fund of around GBP 20 billion mainly in large-caps. Indeed, handling large or mega sum of money is quite different from investing with a smaller amount.

This does not mean that large-cap businesses like Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are inferior as investments. However, it implies that most individual investors often have a larger investable universe to deploy their capital without sacrificing quality.

This is precisely why we think that Smithson's portfolio can be quite a useful reference. The investment trust employs the same strategy as Fundsmith, its parent, but it applies it to the small- and mid-cap space only.

The fund is over one year old now. Last month, its portfolio manager, Simon Barnard, held the first annual meeting and shared his candid perspective on investing, industries and some of the Smithson's holdings, including many of the quality names that we believe alpha-seeking investors should consider owning.

Rightmove

Barnard appreciates the subscription model at Rightmove (LSE:RMV), which provides stable revenue through its growth strategy of selling more digital products, and super-normal profitability, reflected by a nearly 70% operating margin. He thinks the market misunderstands the name, as its business is not so exposed to the housing market in the short run.

Story continues

Halma

Barnard thinks Halma (LSE:HLMA) is a good acquirer, which is rare in the corporate world. We checked the company's financials for the past decade, and as you can see below, the return on capital remained high, while the annual free cash flow more than quadrupled.

In the meantime, we think that investors should always be cautious (or even skeptical) towards any inorganic growth strategy unless a solid long-time track record can exemplify superior acquisition skill.

Paycom

Barnard expresses his concern about the high valuation of Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) while acknowledging its business value of saving costs for clients. The shares traded at a less than 2% free cash flow yield most of the time over the past three years (see below).

CDK Global

The fund sold CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK) over the period. Barnard attributes the disposal to the indication of poor capital allocation. In detail, he pointed to the new CEO's decision of selling fast-growing digital marketing business and previous record of some quite expensive technology acquisitions, as well as his preference for the company to utilize the attractive valuation and continue share buybacks

Check Point

According to Barnard, the management at Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) attributes the slow-down in sales to the issue of salesforce instead of its product. The fund manager would like to give another 12 months and keep the situation monitored. Per the chart below, the top-line growth at the Israeli cybersecurity company fell to a low-single-digit rate in recent years.

Consumer goods vs. industrials

Barnard thinks that high-quality consumer companies tend to get large over time. They are either old companies or are being consolidated. Therefore, he feels it is difficult to find small-cap consumer businesses that fit his investment criteria. Fevertree Drinks (LSE:FEVR) is one of the very few exceptions in his portfolio.

On the contrary, the fund manager believes that small industrials are generally more attractive than large ones, as the former group can grow quickly in their respective market niches even during market downturns and is less prone to economic cycles. This reminds us of our favorite industrial company, Graco (GGG), the mid-cap market leader in the niche of handling fluids.

Quality

In light of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, Barnard emphasizes the significance of owning quality businesses that produce reliable cash flow and have a strong balance sheet. Although admitting that he had no concrete number yet, he believes that these companies can possess even stronger positions once we start to come out of the crisis.

Easter holiday background

Easter is a Christian holiday that commemorates Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. Common activities during the holy weekend include Easter egg decorating and egg hunts, which often contain chocolate products like Hershey's Kisses, Tootsie Rolls and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Other common Easter traditions include Easter carols and spring clothes.

Excel Add-In introduction

As the name implies, our Excel Add-In allows you to download data from our website and interact with the data using Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office Excel software. Our research platform includes a wide range of stock financial data and guru portfolio data.

The following video highlights several key Excel Add-In features, which include the following: Equity Screen Stock Summary, Equity Screen DCF Model, Equity Screen Guru Trades and our GURUF function.

Equity Screen Stock Summary

Figure 1 shows a sample ""stock summary"" output page for Tootsie Roll Industries.

Figure 1

As Figure 1 illustrates, the Equity Screen Stock Summary page description includes the same sections as the website's summary page, including business description, valuation chart, financial strength ratios, profitability ratios, valuation ratios, dividend and buyback ratios and much more.

Story continues

The Chicago-based company manufactures and sells a wide range of candy products, including Tootsie Roll, Charms, Blow-Pops, Dots and Junior Mints. GuruFocus ranks the company's financial strength and profitability 7 out of 10 on several positive investing signs, which include a strong Altman Z-score of 7.6, debt ratios that outperform over 93% of global competitors, and profit margins that outperform over 81% of global consumer packaged goods producers. 0b4eb51ce2553a46f9c93cfc81560910.png

Equity Screen DCF Model

Figure 2 shows a sample ""DCF Model"" output page for Lindt.

Figure 2

As Figure 2 illustrates, the ""DCF Model"" output page closely resembles the website's DCF Calculator page. Enter the values for each parameter by changing the cells in yellow only. The Excel Add-In then updates the calculation of the company's intrinsic value based on the discounted cash flow model.

Lindt manufactures and sells premium chocolates through brands like Lindt, Ghirardelli and Russell Stover. GuruFocus ranks the company's profitability 9 out of 10 on several positive investing signs, which include a high Piotroski F-score of 7 and a GuruFocus business predictability rank of five stars. 09cd6bb15c33e0d3f3a11fba4d6bf7e4.png

Despite high profitability, the stock is overvalued based on the discounted cash flow valuation. Using the default parameters, the Kilchberg, Switzerland-based company's intrinsic value is approximately 3,032.69 Swiss francs ($3,139.92) according to the model, while the Thursday closing price is 7,840 Swiss francs.

Equity Screen Guru Trades

Figure 3 shows a sample ""Guru Trades"" page for Nestle.

A Daniel Loeb (Trades, Portfolio) activist target, Nestle manufactures a wide range of food and beverage products through brands like Nestle, Nescafe, Perrier, Pure Life and Purina. Common Nestle candy products include KitKat and Smarties.

GuruFocus ranks Nestle's profitability 8 out of 10 on several positive investing signs, which include consistent revenue growth over the past 10 years and an operating margin that has increased approximately 2.5% per year on average over the past five years and is outperforming over 88% of global competitors. 0095fd9be9f9a4428f0a914609076ed4.png

Gurus with holdings in Nestle include Loeb, Charles de Vaulx and David Herro (Trades, Portfolio). ae77c0c13da1b65b9c6a86239f6234fa.png

GURUF

Figure 4 illustrates sample GURUF output for Hershey and Mondelez.

Figure 4. Notice how the ""Revenue per Share"" entry in the formula is not case sensitive, i.e., GURUF accepts any version of ""Revenue per Share.""

As Figure 4 illustrates, the GURUF function contains the following format:

=GURUF(ticker, calculation, data/time, quarter/annual, show date, transpose, display order, refresh).

The ticker and calculation parameters are required. By default, including vales for just these parameters gives the current or most-recent value for the ticker and calculation combination. Example: =GURUF(""HSY"",""REVENUE"") gives Hershey's revenue over the past 12 months, which is $7,986.25 million.

Other parameters allow the user to control the GURUF output:

Data/time controls the time frame for data retrieval: ""2017"" means to retrieve data for year 2017 only, ""2017:2018"" means to retrieve data for 2017-18, and ""2017:"" means to retrieve data for 2017 and beyond. Quarter/annual answers the following question: Do I want GURUF to retrieve quarterly data or annual data? Examples:

=GURUF(""MDLZ"",""Revenue per share"",""-5"",""A"") retrieves Mondelez's per-share revenue for the past five years. =GURUF(""MDLZ"",""Revenue per share"",""-5"",""Q"") retrieves Mondelez's per-share revenue for the past five quarters. Show date: As the name implies, enter yes to show the dates or no to not show the dates. Transpose: Enter H (horizontal) to show the data as rows or V (vertical) to show the data as columns. Display order: Enter ASC (ascending) to report the oldest data toward the top or left of the output, or DESC (descending) to report the newest data toward the top or left of the output. Refresh: A parameter that should not affect the GURUF output but could show up in the formula.

Conclusions

The Excel Add-In is one of our major Premium and Premium Plus features. Premium members are limited to 2,000 queries per month, while Premium Plus members have unlimited queries.

369,2020-03-30T23:02:07+00:00,Buying What the Fed Buys,"On Monday, March 23, the Federal Reserve announced a series of aggressive stimulus measures to combat the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy.

""Aggressive effort must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and income and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate,"" the Fed said in a press release. The stimulus measures include the following:

Unlimited purchasing of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Lending up to $300 billion to employers, consumers and businesses. Establishing additional credit facilities to lend to large employers. Increasing the flow of credit to municipalities. Establishing a facility to lend to certain small and medium-sized businesses. Purchasing investment-grade corporate bonds.

Businesses that receive Fed support through any of the above measures are likely to recover more quickly from the economic crisis. This is especially true now that the central bank is purchasing corporate debt, which will make things easier for specific companies more than the economy at large.

When there is a large uptick in demand for a company's assets, share prices will typically rise. Thus, regardless of whether U.S. stocks have hit the bottom or whether they still have room to fall before recovering, investors may want to consider buying what the Fed is buying when it comes to debt and equity markets.

Corporate debt

When purchasing corporate debt, the Fed is not likely to pick and choose which debt it buys based on a company's long-term stock price prospects, as doing so would serve to unbalance the economy more than help it.

Instead, the central bank has pledged to purchase up to 20% of the assets of U.S.-listed bond exchange-traded funds, which provide broad, passive exposure to investment-grade bonds. ETFs also have the advantage of being more liquid than bonds, which is an essential quality when the goal is to stimulate markets as quickly as possible.

Story continues

In general, securities listed on ETFs tend to trade at higher prices relative to intrinsic value than their non-ETF counterparts. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the companies whose common stock together makes up approximately 18% of the S&P 500 Index, all have trailing 12-month price-earnings ratios above 20 as of March 30. Of the five, only Apple has a current price-earnings ratio below 20 at 19.98. 3753a77c6888bbb89a73003a90ac5854.png

With the central bank potentially boosting the demand for bond ETFs by up to 20%, any of these ETFs that it purchases will most likely see a corresponding increase in value. In light of this, which bond ETFs is the Fed most likely to purchase?

One likely candidate is the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond (LQD) ETF, which purchases investment-grade corporate bonds that have a weighted average maturity of around 13 years. With a market cap of $38.08 billion and a dividend yield of 3.39%, the LQD ETF is up 3% over the past year and down approximately 6% since U.S. markets peaked in mid-February. 43a4b86986ab9b7e6657d4b85a51a705.png

The iShares ETFs are run by BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, which has agreed to cooperate with the New York Fed by not charging it fees on its ETFs. There are also plans for BlackRock to lead two corporate credit facilities for the Fed, one for existing bonds and one for new bonds.

The iShares 1-3 Year Credit Bond ETF (NASDAQ:IGSB) is another BlackRock ETF for investment-grade corporate bonds, focusing on shorter-term debt with an average remaining maturity of one to three years. It has a market cap of $12.63 billion and a dividend yield of 3.13%. The ETF is up 1% over the past year and down 3% since mid-February. 8d41334a10f3c260870482b8efd70061.png

Other investment-grade corporate bond ETFs include the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCIT) ETF, the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCSH) ETF and the SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond (SPIB) ETF.

Top of the ETFs

In terms of specific companies, the ones that will benefit the most from these bond ETF purchases are the ones that are present in these ETFs. Naturally, companies without investment-grade debt will not benefit from this form of monetary stimulus.

The largest company holdings of the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and several similar ETFs are the big six U.S. banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS). While the current target interest rate of 0% to 0.25% does not bode well for the short-term profitability of banks, the banking industry will likely see gains again if the Fed eventually raises interest rates.

Other top investment-grade corporate bond ETF holdings include Apple, Microsoft, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). These giants are on the forefront of tech and communications infrastructure, and their common stocks are also common ETF holdings.

Non-cyclical consumer companies also take up a significant portion of these ETFs. For example, three of the top 10 bonds of the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF are for CVS Health Corp. (CVS). AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) bonds hold a top 10 spot in several of this type of ETF, including the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF.

Venturing into stocks

Some analysts speculate that in addition to corporate debt ETFs, the Fed will follow the Bank of Japan's lead and enter the stock market by purchasing shares of common stock, most likely through ETFs as well.

A ""whatever it takes"" attitude could possibly lead to this, if existing stimulus measures are not enough. After all, with interest rates at zero, the Fed's most powerful economic stimulus tool has already been exhausted.

On the March 6 meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, a board of economists that watches over Fed activities, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said, ""We should allow the central bank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets.""

Keep in mind that this possibility is completely speculative as of the writing of this article. Before the Fed could buy stocks, it would need to get congressional approval. However, with the Fed unleashing unprecedented stimulus measures, some analysts speculate that it will become even more aggressive in its policies if markets continue to worsen.

Conclusion

With the Fed becoming active in the economy at unprecedented levels, investors may need to give the institution some weight in their considerations of the companies that will be affected by its decisions.

Long story short, the Fed becoming involved enough in corporate debt to buy up to 20% of investment-grade corporate debt ETFs means that investment-grade companies will be getting a leg up over those with lower credit ratings. This comes at a time when increasing corporate debt in the U.S. has led to waves of credit downgrades, meaning that debt is becoming more concentrated at the top.

370,2020-03-23T11:40:29+00:00,3 ETFs To Short The Dow,"With last Friday's 4.55% slide, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased all of the gains accrued since President Trump won the 2016 election. Using the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA) as the guide, the blue-chip index enters Monday 35.14% below its 52-week high.

Traders considering bearish and inverse leveraged exchange traded funds on the Dow would clearly be onto something, particularly with Dow futures swooning again Sunday evening. Things are so bad in fact for the index to start 2020 that each of the benchmark's 30 components are in the red and 25 of those stocks are down 20% or more.

That could be a sign the once beloved Dow could be in for more near-term downside, bringing with it opportunity in the following bearish ETFs.

See Also: The Most Shorted ETFs Amid The Coronavirus Market Crash

ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG)

The ProShares Short Dow30 (NYSE: DOG) is a good idea for risk-averse investors that are looking for short-term hedges or to participate in some of the broader market's downside. DOG is an inverse though not leveraged fund, meaning it should deliver a gain of 1% on a day in which the Dow loses 1%.

With Boeing's (NYSE: BA) rapid fall from grace, DOG is now an interesting way of hedging long bets in stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH), which are now the Dow's top two stocks.

Remember that the Dow is a price-weighted, not a cap-weighted index, meaning the stock with the largest price tag takes on the largest weight in the in benchmark.

ProShares UltraPro Short Dow30 (SDOW)

Some bearish leveraged ETFs are thriving in the current environment and the ProShares UltraPro Short Dow30 (NYSE: SDOW) is certainly part of that club. Last Friday, SDOW gain 12.83% on nearly double the average daily volume, meaning the bearish Dow fund has more than doubled just this month. That's tempting, but traders should still treat SDOG as they would any other leveraged ETF.

Story continues

“Due to the compounding of daily returns, holding periods of greater than one day can result in returns that are significantly different than the target return and ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period,” according to ProShares.

Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (TECS)

Clearly, the first two bearish ETFs highlighted here are dedicated Dow plays. Obviously, the Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TECS) is an inverse technology play and not focused on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

However, there are relevant tie ins. With Boeing's slide, the industrial sector is losing prominence in the Dow while tech is now the benchmark's biggest sector weight at 24.44%.

TECS looks to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of the Technology Select Sector Index, a benchmark that devotes almost 40% of its weight to Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). That index is also home to four more Dow components: Visa (NYSE: V), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Cisco (NYSE: CSCO) and IBM (NYSE: IBM).

So yes, TECS is a fine way for active traders to put on short-term, bearish Dow positions.

Commitment to Adjusted Operating Margin Targets for Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 of 20% and 22.5%, Respectively1

Creation of Finance and Strategy Committee of the Board to Oversee Operational Improvement Initiatives

Increases Share Repurchase Authorization Resulting in $1.5 Billion Available for Repurchase

KANSAS CITY, Mo., April  09, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ: CERN) (“Cerner” or the “Company”) today announced that the Company has entered into a cooperation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with Starboard Value LP (together with certain of its affiliates, “Starboard”). The Cooperation Agreement includes a Board refreshment plan, operational improvement initiatives, commitments for operating margin targets, a new Finance and Strategy Committee of the Board and an expanded capital return program to drive the next phase of profitable growth and value creation.

The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has appointed four new directors, effective immediately: John Greisch, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., R. Halsey Wise, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MedAssets Inc., Melinda Mount, former President of AliphCom, Inc. (d/b/a Jawbone), and George Riedel, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cloudmark, Inc. and a former Senior Partner of McKinsey & Co. The four new directors have been appointed to Classes II, III, II and III, respectively. As members of Class III, Messrs. Wise and Riedel will be standing for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). Current Cerner Board member William Zollars has been appointed to the newly created position of Lead Independent Director.

The Company also announced that Denis Cortese is retiring from the Board at the end of his term and will not stand for re-election. Following the Annual Meeting, the Board will comprise 10 members, nine of whom are independent. With Mr. Cortese’s retirement, the previously announced retirement of co-founder Cliff Illig, and the additions of the four new directors, Cerner will have refreshed more than one half of its Board since 2017.

“Since assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer in 2018, I, along with our entire Board and leadership team, have been reviewing Cerner’s operational and financial performance to identify opportunities to unlock the Company’s significant potential,” said Brent Shafer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cerner. “We are focused on effectively implementing a refined operating model to improve efficiency and profitability, while also innovating at scale for our clients and preparing Cerner for its next phase of growth and shareholder value creation. We are committed to delivering significant operating margin improvement and returning capital to our shareholders, while maintaining an unwavering focus on delivering value to our clients.”

“We welcome John, Melinda, George and Halsey to the Cerner Board,” said Mitch Daniels, Chair of the Board’s Nominating, Governance & Public Policy Committee. “These directors will bring invaluable counsel from their experience in leading, operating and advising software and healthcare technology companies. I believe we will greatly benefit from their perspectives as we continue to execute on our operational initiatives and build on our position as a leading innovator in health care. We feel strongly that the actions we are taking today will generate long-term value for all Cerner stakeholders.”

Peter Feld, Managing Member of Starboard, added, “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Cerner which includes a meaningful refreshment of the Board, as well as important steps towards implementing operational improvement initiatives that will drive profitable growth. We believe the operating margin targets and the significantly expanded capital return program demonstrate a strong commitment to driving improved results and shareholder value creation. We are confident that the new directors announced today will bring fresh perspectives and added expertise to the Board. Cerner is a great company with significant value potential, and we look forward to seeing the results of the initiatives announced today.”

Mr. Daniels continued, “On behalf of the entire Board and management team, I’d like to thank Denis for his years of service to Cerner. Cerner has valued his counsel, extensive industry research and medical experience, and we wish him well.”

Operational Improvement Initiatives

After a thorough internal and external review over the last year, Cerner is making a series of changes to its organizational structure, go-to-market philosophy and capital allocation program. Notably Cerner has taken the following actions:

Eliminated the President role and created a more client-focused organization under the Chief Client Officer;Eliminated the Strategic Business Unit (SBU) structure, which has streamlined operations by reducing redundancy, improving efficiency and focusing the organization on profitable growth areas and client commitments;Undertaken a comprehensive portfolio review to drive efficiencies and focus within Cerner’s product development teams;Centralized operational functions that were formerly spread across different leaders under the Chief Operating Officer;Announced the intent to initiate a dividend, significantly increase the share repurchase authorization and focus on free cash flow generation by linking it to executives’ variable compensation;Committed to operating margin expansion resulting from anticipated benefits of the new operating model and additional efficiencies expected to be identified in the new operating structure; andFormed a new Finance and Strategy Committee of the Board to oversee operational and financial improvement initiatives.

Cerner transitioned to its new operating structure in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has been focused on leveraging the impact of this reorganization and identifying additional efficiencies. Currently, Cerner is focused on reducing operating expense and generating other efficiencies that will improve its adjusted operating margin, with targeted adjusted operating margins of 20% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.5% for the fourth quarter of 2020.1

To assist in these efforts, Cerner has engaged AlixPartners, LLP, a leading outside consulting firm, to conduct a detailed review of its operations and cost structure. The goal is to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and achieve and improve upon the efficiencies without impacting important investments in Cerner’s solutions and commitments to the Company’s clients.

The review of these efforts will be overseen by a newly formed Finance and Strategy Committee of the Board, which comprises five members, including Mr. Greisch as Committee Chair, Messrs. Riedel, Wise and Zollars and Ms. Mount. The Finance and Strategy Committee will work closely with management and AlixPartners as Cerner executes its strategy to achieve the operational targets identified. In addition to the Finance and Strategy Committee, each of the four newly appointed directors will join a minimum of one additional Board committee.

Share Repurchase Authorization

Cerner also today announced that its Board has approved an amendment to its stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of an additional $1.2 billion of its common stock. When combined with the $0.3 billion of authorization remaining on the program that was approved in May 2018, the total authorized amount available for repurchase is approximately $1.5 billion. The Company intends to fund the repurchase program with cash from operations and by issuing debt.

Cerner plans to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions or possibly through other transactions managed by broker-dealers. The Company expects to execute the majority of the repurchase authorization in the next 12 months, subject to market conditions and other factors, including price.

Significantly increasing the repurchase program and the recently announced initiation of a dividend reflects Cerner’s commitment to returning capital to shareholders and the Company’s belief in Cerner’s long-term potential as it executes a balanced capital allocation program combined with the operational improvement initiatives identified.

Cooperation Agreement with Starboard

Starboard, which owns approximately 1.2% of Cerner’s outstanding shares, has agreed to vote all of its shares in favor of Cerner’s nominees at the Annual Meeting and has entered into other customary standstill and voting commitments. The full Cooperation Agreement between Cerner and Starboard will be filed on a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

2019 Annual Meeting

The Annual Meeting is scheduled to be held on Thursday, May 30, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, in the Cerner Round Auditorium in the Cerner Vision Center, located on the Cerner campus at 2850 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri. The record date for determining eligibility to vote at the Annual Meeting is Tuesday, April 30, 2019.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with Cerner's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculations. We provide the measures of Adjusted Operating Earnings and Adjusted Operating Margin as such measures are used by management, along with GAAP results, to analyze Cerner's business, make strategic decisions, assess long-term trends on a comparable basis, and for management compensation purposes.

We calculate each of our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:

Adjusted Operating Earnings - Consists of GAAP operating earnings adjusted for: (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) Health Services acquisition-related amortization, (iii) acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, (iv) an allowance on non-current asset, and (v) other adjustments.

Adjusted Operating Margin - Consists of Adjusted Operating Earnings, as defined above, divided by revenues, in the applicable period; the result presented as a percentage.

Adjustments included in the calculations of Adjusted Operating Earnings are described below:

Share-based compensation expense - Non-cash expense arising from our equity compensation and stock purchase plans available to our associates and directors. We exclude share-based compensation expense as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Share-based compensation expense is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

(In thousands) Years Ended 20182017 Sales and client service $46,239 $48,063 Software development 21,468 19,196 General and administrative 34,712 21,710 Total share-based compensation expense $102,419 $88,969

Health Services acquisition-related amortization - Non-cash expense consisting of the amortization of customer relationships, acquired technology, and trade name intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. We exclude Health Services acquisition-related amortization as we believe the amount of such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Such amount is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption ""Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.""

Acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment - Consists of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments in connection with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. Accounting guidance requires that deferred revenue acquired in a business combination be written-down to an estimate of fulfillment cost, plus a normal profit margin, as a part of the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We add back the amount of the write-down applicable to the period as we believe such amount directly correlates to the underlying performance of our business operations.

Allowance on non-current asset - Consists of a pre-tax charge to provide an allowance against certain disputed client receivables with a specific former client. Such disputed receivables are included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in the caption ""Other assets,"" as the process for resolution has been on-going for approximately 10 years. We have excluded this charge as we believe the amount of such charge does not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations in the period it was recorded. Such charge is included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption ""Sales and client service"" expense.

Other adjustments - Consists of certain charges which we believe may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. Other adjustments for the three and twelve months ended December 29, 2018 are comprised of certain employee separation expenses including such expenses incurred in connection with our former president's separation from the Company. Other adjustments for the twelve months ended December 30, 2017 are comprised of acquisition, employee separation, and other costs associated with our acquisition of the Health Services business in February 2015. Such amounts are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the caption ""General and administrative"" expense.

1 Future period non-GAAP guidance includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, which may include, without limitation, share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related expenses. Such adjustments may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, as well as nonrecurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains or other items that may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. The exact amounts of these adjustments are not currently determinable but may be significant. It is therefore not practicable to provide the comparable GAAP measures or reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures. See reconciliation for historical GAAP operating margin in the Appendix.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/09/1799598/10862/en/Cerner-Announces-Agreement-with-Starboard-Value-Regarding-Board-Refreshment-Operational-Improvement-Initiatives-and-Expanded-Capital-Return-Program-to-Drive-Next-Phase-of-Profitabl.html,"['ACXM.US', 'AZPN.US', 'BAX.US', 'CERN.US', 'HRC.US', 'MS.US', 'MSFT.US', 'XPER.US']","['CERNER CORPORATION', 'NASDAQ:CERN']","{'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.097}"
374,2019-03-07T15:20:00+00:00,"In Era of Elevated Risk, Reputation Institute Says it’s ‘Reputation Judgement Day’ in 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 – World’s Largest Corporate Reputation Study","Boston, MA, March  07, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- It’s a new age for corporate reputation, in which companies are scrutinized on every aspect of their operations, and it’s putting tremendous pressure on companies who are increasingly on trial in the court of public opinion.

In the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100, an annual ranking of public perception toward the world’s top companies, researchers at the Reputation Institute – a leading provider of reputation measurement and management services – surveyed more than 230,000 individuals in 15 countries.

While the overall results of the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 show improvement over 2018, which saw a reputation decline, Reputation Institute Chief Reputation Officer Stephen Hahn-Griffiths says companies must continue to work hard to convert “fence sitters who are much less likely to give companies the benefit of the doubt.”

“It’s reputation judgement day, given that 52% of the world have doubts about the good intentions of all companies,” said Hahn-Griffiths. “At the same time, companies have a great opportunity to create and deliver reputation assurances that, over time, can convert fence sitters to promoters. Companies that elevate positive perceptions of the enterprise, prioritize corporate responsibility, leverage strong leadership, are ethical, speak to the corporate brand purpose and engage market influences are those who will win in this daunting new reputation era.”

While a lack of assurances means that overall company support did not bounce back to the lofty levels of 2017, an increase of 1.0 points in reputation in the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 signals the potential for a true reputation recovery.

“The reputation bubble burst in 2018, but there has been a reputation recovery in the past 12 months,” said Hahn-Griffiths. “Companies like Netflix and Microsoft have strengthened their reputation. Others like Facebook, even Google, have declined and have been punished in the court of public opinion. And some have even started to turn things around, such as Uber.”

In the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100, Rolex and The LEGO Group maintain the leading positions. Netflix surged from 24thplace to ninth place while Michelin moves up to the eight spot. The BMW Group, which placed ninth a year ago, and Google (third in 2018), slipped out of the top 10. Facebook had the biggest overall decline in reputation, largely driven by its perceived short-comings on governance andin the workplace.

The top 10 companies in the 2019 Global RepTrak® 100 are:

RolexThe LEGO GroupThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS)Adidas Group (OTCQX: ADDYY)Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Sony (NYSE: SNE)Canon (NYSE: CAJ)Michelin (OTCMKTS: MGDDY)Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)The Bosch Group (NYSE: AVX)

“It is very rewarding to be ranked first on the Global RepTrak 100 for the fourth year in a row,” said Virginie Chevailler, Head of Public Relations at Rolex. “The company has a history of more than a century of perpetual improvement and innovation at every level. We believe this is recognition of our commitment to always reach further, along with our desire to contribute to society.”

Microsoft bucked the reputation trend among technology companies and jumped five places to number five in the 2019 rankings. Among other assurances, Microsoft has remained transparent in the face of product bugs and updates.

“We’re humbled to be recognized amongst the five most reputable global brands as it reflects our commitment to ethics, transparency, and corporate responsibility” said Steve Clayton, General Manager – Communications, at Microsoft.

376,2019-02-24T17:45:00+00:00,Philips showcases unique augmented reality concept for image-guided minimally invasive therapies developed with Microsoft,"February 24, 2019

Companies collaborate to combine Philips’ industry-leading Azurion image-guided therapy platform with Microsoft HoloLens 2 mixed reality computing platform as a concept for the operating room of the future

Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Barcelona, Spain – At the MWC Barcelona, one of the largest mobile events in the world, Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology today unveiled a unique mixed reality concept developed together with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) for the operating room of the future. Based on the state-of-the-art technologies of Philips’ industry-leading Azurion image-guided therapy platform and Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 holographic computing platform, the companies will showcase novel augmented reality applications for image-guided minimally invasive therapies.

In contrast to open surgery, minimally invasive therapies only require a small incision. Dedicated instruments such as catheters are inserted through the incision and guided to the treatment area, which can include the heart, blood vessels, brain, liver and other major organs. During minimally invasive procedures physicians cannot directly see and touch the treatment area. Instead they rely on advanced medical imaging technologies such as ultra-low dose X-ray imaging and ultrasound, as well as other navigation technologies, to see inside the patient and guide their actions. Philips is a leading provider of high tech interventional suites and hybrid operating rooms for such procedures.

The Philips and Microsoft augmented reality concept, built for HoloLens 2, brings live imaging and other sources of vital data currently displayed on large 2D screens into a 3D holographic augmented reality environment that can be ergonomically, easily and intuitively controlled by the physician. The concept is being used to gather further clinical insights to support the development of future commercially-available augmented reality solutions for use in image-guided procedures.

“The transition from open surgery to image-guided procedures has driven a seismic shift in improving patient outcomes and reducing costs – not least by dramatically reducing the length of time a patient stays in a hospital after their procedure,” said Atul Gupta, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Image Guided Therapy at Philips and a practicing interventional and diagnostic radiologist. “On our Azurion platform we seamlessly integrate a range of data sources in a way that’s intuitive to understand and control. By collaborating with Microsoft and HoloLens 2 we can take it to the next level, immersing the physician in a tailored augmented reality environment. This concept allows me to see the real world superimposed with the live data and 3D medical imagery needed to guide our precision therapy, and importantly also lets me control Azurion with voice recognition, eye tracking and advanced gestures. It’s all about keeping our focus on the patient.”

“Mixed reality is giving people new ways to interact with the digital and physical world, bringing the benefits of the digital revolution to entirely new experiences across the globe,” said Alex Kipman, Technical Fellow, AI and Mixed Reality at Microsoft. “I am thrilled to see companies in a broad range of industries achieve more using the products that we build with our partners and ecosystem. Mixed reality holds great potential in healthcare, and our collaboration with Philips shows how that potential is already beginning to be realized.”

Microsoft unveiled HoloLens 2 on 24 February at MWC Barcelona. HoloLens is a self-contained holographic computer that enables hands-free, heads-up interaction with 3-dimensional digital objects. HoloLens 2 builds on the breakthrough technology of HoloLens and is even more immersive, more comfortable and delivers more value right out of the box.
Complemented by existing and new Azure cloud services, and with built-in AI, HoloLens 2 is the ultimate intelligent edge device.

Since its global launch in February 2017, over half a million patients have been treated in more than 80 countries using the Azurion platform, which is powered by Philips’ proprietary ConnectOS and combines technical innovations in both software and hardware. ConnectOS allows the integration of advanced digital innovations on the Azurion platform. Philips previously announced that it is developing an augmented reality solution for spine, cranial and trauma procedures.

Innovation is core to Philips’ growth strategy in health technology, and the company spends approximately EUR 1.8 billion annually on R&D. In recent years Philips has significantly stepped up its activities in software, adaptive intelligence and data science. Today, around one in every two of Philips’ R&D professionals is active in this field. Philips has successfully developed the Philips HealthSuite Platforms, a common digital framework that connects consumers, patients and healthcare providers in a cloud-based connected health ecosystem of devices, apps and tools.

377,2019-02-12T12:00:00+00:00,Microshare® Inc. Closes $5M Investment Including Motley Fool Participation,"PHILADELPHIA, Feb.  12, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following its recent acceptance into Microsoft’s coveted Co-Sell program (NASDAQ:MSFT), Microshare Inc. announced the closing of $5 million in investments, with the largest share by the global investment advisor Motley Fool.

Philadelphia-based Microshare, whose unique data management and sharing software enables secure revenue and efficiency models in facilities management, logistics and other sectors, says the new funding will be devoted to scaling successful pilots in Europe and North America, expansion to other global markets, and for platform and product development.

A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3bf3163d-19ad-4720-a5d5-65ba246c9b4c

“Data is money, and if something is worth money, the first question is ‘who owns it,’ and the second is ‘can I share it for value?’” said Ron Rock, CEO of Microshare. “We started Microshare to leverage our decades of experience in data, so we could help companies begin to manage and monetize it from both their traditional operations and the new explosion of IoT data. We view both the Motley Fool investment and Microsoft’s engagement with us as key votes of confidence in our scalable approach.”

Motley Fool’s investment represents the data firm’s first foray into institutional equity, a sign of the upward trajectory anticipated for Microshare’s revenue and valuation in the current climate. Industry analysts note that data management firm valuations have jumped of late.

The company is actively recruiting technical experts for research and development (R&D) along with sales and customer support professionals. The move will increase pre- and post-sales support for customers across Europe, eastern Canada, and central and eastern regions in the United States, who represent nearly 70% of MadCap’s customers.

More than 18,000 companies worldwide rely on MadCap Software’s desktop and cloud-based solutions to create, review and deliver technical, medical and policy documentation across multiple channels. Over the last 12 months, the company has seen double-digit growth in European sales alone, and Europe now accounts for more than 25% of MadCap’s overall business, making it the second largest market next to the US.

“We recognize that our success is directly linked to the success of customers using our products to deliver the state-of-the-art content that is critical to their businesses. And because great customer support is just as important as great software, we have made extensive investments in building both cutting-edge solutions and extremely knowledgeable sales and technical support teams to give users the tools and expertise they need to succeed,” said Anthony Olivier, MadCap founder and CEO. “The addition of our Austin office builds on this commitment and our reputation for having the best support in the industry. Together our Austin and La Jolla teams will enable us to more effectively serve customers around the world using our products as we continue raising the bar on quality service, support and technology.”

The Austin office expansion is being led by Taunya Conte, MadCap chief financial officer (CFO), who has relocated from the company’s California headquarters. As a 12-year veteran at MadCap, she will be instrumental in recruiting and onboarding the Austin team, as well as implementing the business practices around creating a superior experience for customers and employees, which have been central to the company’s strong success. MadCap has been profitable since the first month the company introduced its cornerstone MadCap Flare software in 2006, and it has continued to grow organically with no outside funding since.

“The strength of our team has been central to driving the customer demand and loyalty that have enabled our rapid growth and profitability, and it’s a top priority to maintain our team culture even as we expand,” said MadCap CFO Taunya Conte. “Austin is a natural choice for our new office—with a culturally rich, vibrant community; strong university presence; and active lifestyle that are very similar to the San Diego region where our headquarters is based. We look forward to building the Austin team and continuing our tradition of providing growth opportunities that benefit both our employees and customers.”

387,2018-05-03T14:00:00+00:00,"MadCap Software Gives Authors Flexibility to Create, Review and Deliver Content from their Desktops or the Cloud with Newest Releases of MadCap Central and MadCap Flare","La Jolla, CA, May  03, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MadCap Software, Inc., the leader in multi-channel content authoring and a showcase company for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visual Studio, today announced that MadCap Central May 2018 Release and MadCap Flare 2018 are now available. Through the addition of a new lightweight editor in the cloud, the latest versions of MadCap Central and MadCap Flare give technical writers and content developers greater flexibility than ever to create, review and deliver technical, medical and policy documentation.

Together, MadCap Central and MadCap Flare provide a comprehensive, agile, and cost-effective alternative to enterprise content management (ECM) and component content management system (CCMS) solutions. MadCap Flare offers cutting-edge technical authoring and publishing capabilities with advanced features to maximize authoring efficiency, content reuse, and multi-channel publishing. MadCap Central is the first cloud-based platform for content and project management designed specifically for the documentation industry. By combining MadCap Flare with MadCap Central’s cloud-based collaboration, publishing, and content management functionality, authors can get the best of both desktop and cloud-based environments, without sacrificing productivity, network requirements, security and more.

MadCap Flare 2018 adds features and functionality designed for the end user, such as powerful new search with Elasticsearch, a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that is fast, powerful and easy to configure. This release also includes powerful analytics and reporting capabilities for the optimization of content quality and accuracy. Additional new features include a modern side navigation HTML5 output for improved search engine optimization (SEO) and user experience, Salesforce Connect improvements, and more.

“Today’s technical communications and documentation professionals increasingly want to combine comprehensive functionality for delivering state-of-the-art content with cloud capabilities for easier collaboration and management. We are giving customers greater flexibility than ever to address these dual demands with our newest releases of MadCap Central and MadCap Flare,” said Anthony Olivier, MadCap founder and CEO. “Our new MadCap Central cloud-based editor brings a new level of ease to non-Flare users who need to review on contribute content while new capabilities in MadCap Flare provide authors with a single solution for producing modern, multimedia-enriched web content.”

New Cloud-based Editor in MadCap Central
MadCap Central is the powerful cloud-based content management solution designed specifically for the creators of MadCap Flare-based content. With MadCap Central, technical communication professionals and content developers can facilitate collaboration among teams and other departments, automate publishing, track tasks and projects, manage user permissions to control access and maintain quality, and host projects and content in the cloud—all from one central location. Additionally, the highly scalable MadCap Central can grow to meet the demands of any size organization.

At the heart of MadCap Central May 2018 Release is the new cloud-based editor, which enables subject matter experts, authors, and other users in the organization to easily create and review Flare content using an integrated cloud-based workflow. The new editor frees SMEs from having to download and install any software, since the contribution and review workflow is completely integrated and takes place in the cloud using any web browser, and it enables multiple users to contribute, make changes and add comments to the same topic or snippet simultaneously. Importantly, the lightweight editor offers a streamlined, easy-to-use interface where SMEs only see options and features that are relevant to the contribution and review process, and changes are auto-saved as users work. Once the review process is completed, a user simply submits any reviewed topics and snippets back to the Flare author.

Unlike the XML Editor in MadCap Flare, the MadCap Central cloud-based editor provides only the features necessary for contribution and review by SMEs and non-Flare users. These include the ability to insert and delete annotations, make additions and deletions to content and track these changes, and review but not edit condition tags.

With the addition of the cloud-based editor, MadCap Central also now features two kinds of users: authors and SMEs. Authors work in MadCap Flare to create, edit and publish content, as well as in MadCap Central to manage projects, and they have full access to all of MadCap Central’s functionality. SMEs only have access to parts of the user interface relevant for adding or reviewing content. Author and SME subscription pricing reflects the different levels of functionality provided for each type of user.

Features for State-of-the-Art MadCap Flare Content
MadCap Flare is used by thousands of companies worldwide to create and publish their technical documentation, user guides, instruction manuals, online Help, and support websites to any number of print, web, desktop and mobile formats—in users’ languages of choice. It is the only professional authoring and publishing solution that allows authors to create and publish responsive HTML5 output with top navigation, which more closely resembles a modern, search engine-optimized, and completely customizable informational website. Native XML architecture gives MadCap Flare the extensibility of leading ECM systems.

With the latest release, MadCap Flare offers several new and enhanced capabilities for delivering modern, best-in-class content.

MadCap Flare 2018 now includes all the features and functionality previously offered by a separate product, MadCap Analyzer, which have now been embedded directly into Flare. Now authors can find and fix critical issues quickly, get content suggestions for snippets and variables, meet accessibility guidelines, generate custom reports, and much more—all within Flare. Additionally, two multimedia products that are tightly integrated with MadCap Flare are now bundled in at no extra cost: MadCap Capture for image capture and editing and MadCap Mimic for creating videos and software simulation movies.

MadCap Flare 2018 also provides three options for search. In addition to MadCap Search and Google Custom Search, authors can now add Elasticsearch to HTML5 web output for top navigation, side navigation, and skinless websites. A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, Elasticsearch is fast, powerful, and easy to configure.

Additionally, the latest release of MadCap Flare offers new side navigation HTML5 output that improves both SEO and the user experience. Authors now have the flexibility to create websites with navigation elements to the left or right side, in addition to top navigation output with MadCap Flare. The new HTML5 output offers all of the advantages of modern web design while offering the traditional side navigation elements of tripane-style Help and support sites.

Also new in MadCap Flare 2018:

Enhancements to Salesforce Connect add support for multiple languages and the latest platform, Salesforce Lightning.Automatically synchronized tables of contents (TOCs) highlight the topic that is open as a user navigates from one topic to the next in HTML5 output.Microsoft product versions now supported include SharePoint 2016, SharePoint 365, and Team Foundation Server 2018.

Pricing for MadCap Central starts at $79 per month for an Author subscription and $10 per month for an SME subscription. It includes 10 GB of storage per company account (with additional storage available), free product upgrades and updates, platinum-level maintenance and support with unlimited email and telephone support, a knowledge base, and forum access.

The RT100 is based on more than 230,000 individual ratings collected in the first quarter of 2018. It includes comparative rankings, demographic trends, and unique insights into the dynamics behind reputational impact. The global study shows what drives trust and identifies supportive behaviors such as intent to purchase a company’s products, willingness to invest in, or even work for, the company.

Rankings dropped for 58 percent of companies in the RT100. Aligned with the decline in reputation, garnering support among stakeholders has become more difficult for companies; expectations have risen, making it harder to earn trust, attain benefit of the doubt, create consumer loyalty and entice investors.

“The reputation bubble has burst. Companies are down by an average of 1.4 points globally, representing the first major decline since the end of the Great Recession,” said Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, Executive Partner and Chief Research Officer for Reputation Institute.

 RI measures the reputation of thousands of companies on an annual basis using its RepTrak® framework. Its Global RT100 study measures the most highly regarded and familiar multinational companies in 15 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

About Reputation Institute Reputation Institute powers the world’s most reputable companies. By tracking and analyzing stakeholder perceptions, we unleash the power of reputation to enable leaders to build better companies. Our RepTrak® model analyzes the reputations of companies and is best known as the Forbes-published Global RepTrak 100. Underlying the model is the RepTrak methodology, the global gold standard for measuring reputation. Learn more at: http://www.reputationinstitute.com.

398,2017-10-23T13:01:00+00:00,Cray and Microsoft Bring Supercomputing to Microsoft Azure,"SEATTLE and REDMOND, Wash., Oct.  23, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced an exclusive strategic alliance with Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) that gives enterprises the tools to enable a new era of discovery and insight, while broadening the availability of supercomputing to new markets and new customers. Under the partnership agreement, Microsoft and Cray will jointly engage with customers to offer dedicated Cray supercomputing systems in Microsoft Azure datacenters to enable customers to run AI, advanced analytics, and modeling and simulation workloads at unprecedented scale, seamlessly connected to the Azure cloud.

Cray’s tightly coupled system architecture and Aries interconnect addresses the exponential demand for compute capability, real-time insights, and scalable performance needed by enterprises today. With this new partnership, Cray and Microsoft have made it easier for cloud customers to harness the power of supercomputing and multiply their problem-solving potential.

401,2017-08-17T21:44:00+00:00,"GEX Management, Inc. Adds Director of Citizenship and Public Affairs for Microsoft to Board of Advisors","DALLAS, Aug.  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GEX Management, Inc. (OTCQB:GXXM) is proud to announce an addition to its Board of Advisors, Raamel Mitchell.

Raamel serves as the Director of Citizenship and Public Affairs for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). A lifelong and avid believer in the power of technology, Raamel began making his mark early when he was recruited by Raytheon at the age of 17 to support the company’s Defense and Special Energy Operations work for the U.S. Department of Energy.

His passion for technology led him to Microsoft where he leads Public Affairs and Citizenship for the central United States, 17 states and 6 district offices. He specializes in building strategic public and private partnerships, making transformational investments for community and philanthropic goals, and advancing policy at the federal, state, and local government levels. With MBAs from Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business and ESADE Business School in Barcelona, Raamel values his role in building human capital pipelines that drive the global economy. His team’s initiatives support STEM education, workforce development, healthcare, entrepreneurship, and civic innovation. Additionally, Raamel balances his role with also serving as the Campus Director for Microsoft’s Las Colinas District Office, one of the largest in the U.S. with over 1,500 employees.

Joining the GEX Management Board of Advisors, Raamel brings his perspective and experience to a company in the midst of dynamic growth.

“I believe in this vision. And I believe in Carl Dorvil’s leadership. I’ve got confidence that their team can do what they’ve set out to do – transform the PEO space.” He continued, “In my role at Microsoft, it’s my job to empower entrepreneurship. One of the most consistent challenges I’ve seen, even among fantastic leaders with excellent ideas, is they get bogged down in the grind of running a business. The risk, the time, the logistics associated with executing and growing an enterprise can at times capsize a venture or limit its growth prematurely. What if you had a payroll partner who could offload those concerns but do so in way that shows it truly understands you as an entrepreneur, your business, whose model was to deliver x+1? That’s GEX Management. I believe I can offer perspective that can help the company really grow into that vision.”

404,2017-01-19T14:00:00+00:00,MadCap Software Launches Industry-First Content Management Solution Designed Specifically for the Technical Documentation Industry,"La Jolla, CA, Jan.  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MadCap Software, Inc., the leader in multi-channel content authoring and a showcase company for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visual Studio, today announced the launch of  MadCap Central, the first cloud-based platform for content and project management designed specifically for the documentation industry.

MadCap Central is integrated with  MadCap Flare, MadCap’s flagship product and the industry’s most advanced single-source, multi-channel authoring and publishing solution. Together MadCap Flare and MadCap Central combine powerful technical authoring software with a cloud-based publishing and content management environment to significantly streamline the entire documentation workflow and enable documentation teams to manage projects and content in one centralized location. The result is a comprehensive, agile, and cost-effective alternative to enterprise content management (ECM) and component content management system (CCMS) solutions.

MadCap Flare is already used by thousands of companies worldwide to create and publish their technical documentation, user guides, instruction manuals, online Help, and support websites to any number of print, web, desktop and mobile formats—in users’ languages of choice. It is the only professional authoring and publishing solution that allows authors to create and publish responsive HTML5 output with top navigation, which more closely resembles a modern, search engine-optimized, and completely customizable informational website. And its native XML architecture gives MadCap Flare the extensibility of leading ECM systems.

MadCap Central is the powerful cloud-based content management solution designed specifically for the creators of Flare-based content. With MadCap Central, technical communications professionals can facilitate collaboration among teams and departments, automate publishing, track tasks and projects, manage user permissions to control access and maintain quality, and host projects and content in the cloud—all from one central location. Additionally, the highly scalable MadCap Central can grow to meet the demands of any size organization.

“From the start, our mission at MadCap Software has been to create a superior experience for technical communications and documentation professionals by empowering them to efficiently develop and deliver state-of-the-art technical content,” said Anthony Olivier, MadCap founder and CEO. “Our new cloud-based MadCap Central builds on this commitment by putting a comprehensive content management solution, which is designed specifically for content creators and extends the functionality of our industry-leading MadCap Flare software, within the reach of companies of all sizes.”

Technical Communications Professionals Cite MadCap Central Benefits

“In contrast to CCMS solutions, which simply store and manage your content in a central database, Madcap Central tackles the publishing and delivery aspect of content,” said Tom Johnson, a technical writer and author of the I’d Rather Be Writing blog. “Pushing the latest updates to your project online in a quick and easy way gives you many advantages in the context of DocOps and agile. You no longer need to use separate systems for source control, task
 management, permissions, and other details. It’s all contained and managed within one central hub. Overall, Madcap Central provides a much-needed publishing and content delivery solution for tech docs.”

“I have used other source control systems with Flare, and they have each had their challenges,” said Kate Montressor, senior technical writer at SilverPeak, Inc. “The MadCap Central solution is so easy and works so well – I think it’s a no-brainer!”

“Tracking multiple projects with multiple authors in multiple statuses can be confusing and downright challenging,” notes Neil Perlin, president of Hyper/Word Services. “MadCap Central’s management dashboard, which is tightly integrated with MadCap Flare, will go a long way toward making project management smooth and efficient.”

New MadCap Central for Cloud-based Content Management

Madcap Central enables users of the latest versions of MadCap Flare to extend their authoring capabilities with a powerful cloud-based platform for content and project management. Now content creators can manage projects and content within one centralized location in order to gain better insight into production schedules, milestones and deliverables with a variety of project management tools and content hosting features. It allows users to upload and import MadCap Flare projects, assign users to projects, manage project status, get notifications, and more.

Projects and content hosted in MadCap Central can be accessed anywhere, and publishing no longer requires IT department resources. From a single user to teams of hundreds, the solution was built for scalability, and adding storage is easy. At the same time, MadCap Central provides the ability automate, manage, and publish builds quickly and easily. Using the Build Management view, users can schedule builds; set builds to “Live” for easy publishing and “Keep” to maintain builds; view generated output; view the build log for details, such as warnings or errors during builds; download builds locally; set a vanity URL; and receive notifications.

Significantly, MadCap Central offers the ability to track and manage tasks by viewing them through a task board or calendar view, and all tasks can be broken down into five categories: To Do, In Progress, Complete, Archived, and Backlog. Key task attributes can include any of the following: title, priority (low, medium, high), related MadCap Flare project, start and due dates, estimated hours, owner and user assignment and file attachments.

406,2016-10-24T16:00:00+00:00,FIDO Alliance Announces New Authentication Specification Effort with EMVCo to Bring Added Security and Convenience to Mobile Payments,"LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Oct 24, 2016) -  MONEY20/20 - FIDO Alliance, the industry consortium developing open, interoperable authentication standards, announced today that it will work with EMVCo to add convenience and security to in-store and in-app EMV®-compliant mobile payments.

The FIDO Alliance will develop a new technical specification into its FIDO authentication suite to fulfill use cases provided by EMVCo. The specification will provide a standard way for mobile wallet providers and payment application developers to support Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method (CDCVM)1, enabling consumers to conveniently use on-device FIDO® Certified authenticators -- such as a fingerprint or ""selfie"" biometrics -- to securely verify their presence when making an in-store or in-app mobile payment.

To enable this capability, the new FIDO Alliance specification will be developed as an extension specification to the Web Authentication specification already in development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The Web Authentication specification, based on three technical specifications submitted by the FIDO Alliance last year, will define a standard web API to enable web applications to move beyond passwords and offer FIDO strong authentication across all web browsers and related web platform infrastructure. With this new specification, the same FIDO-compliant devices used to authenticate users on the web will also be able to fulfill payment networks' CDCVM requirements for mobile payment, giving device manufacturers yet another reason to ship their devices with support for FIDO authentication.

For mobile wallet providers and payment application developers, the development of this specification intends to greatly simplify the development and support for CDCVM across mobile devices and other platforms.

""Today, mobile wallet providers and payment application developers need to custom-build support for CDCVM across mobile devices. This is a huge challenge given the fragmentation in the mobile ecosystem -- there are more than a thousand manufacturers for Android alone,"" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. ""This new specification will enable mobile payment stakeholders to FIDO-enable their applications and get the added benefit of built-in support for CDCVM on every FIDO-compliant mobile device. The mobile industry is rapidly adopting FIDO authentication, with FIDO Certified solutions already available on flagship mobile devices from six of the top 10 mobile handset manufacturers.""

The new FIDO specification will also add another layer of convenience to the consumer mobile payment experience by providing mobile payment applications with additional risk management information, ultimately reducing the number of times that a consumer needs to authenticate themselves in order to approve a payment within a given time period. For example, when the mobile payment application calls the FIDO authenticator, it can check the last time the user was verified by the authenticator. If that falls within the requirements for CDCVM, the payment will be authorized without any additional interaction with the user. The FIDO Alliance also sees the potential for this capability to be extended to use cases beyond payments, including for VPN access, rights managements and workflow management.

W3C Strategy Lead Wendy Seltzer commented, ""W3C is pleased to support this FIDO Alliance extension as yet another example of the growing and vibrant authentication ecosystem enabled through our Web Authentication API, currently under development by the WebAuthn Working Group.""

Brett McDowell made this announcement this morning at Money20/20, being held this week through Oct. 26 in Las Vegas. Attendees looking to learn more about the FIDO Alliance's efforts to help the financial services industry deploy stronger, simpler authentication should stop by the FIDO Ecosystem Pavilion on the show floor, booth #2843.

About The FIDO Alliance The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

407,2016-09-27T14:20:00+00:00,Microsoft and Workday Announce Global Strategic Partnership,"CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - Sep 27, 2016) -  WORKDAY RISING -- Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Workday (NYSE: WDAY) today announced a global, strategic partnership that will expand the business solutions joint customers can use to continually optimize the way work gets done. Through this partnership, the companies unveiled plans to deliver integrations that mirror where and how people want to work across Microsoft Office 365 and Workday's finance and HR applications, which will enable customers to simplify day-to-day tasks, foster collaboration, and increase productivity.

The announcement was made by Workday Co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri at Workday Rising, complemented by a video appearance by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

""Connecting the productivity tools in Office 365 with Workday's finance and HR applications will enable customers globally to uncover new ways to produce great work that ultimately drives their businesses forward,"" said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and CEO, Workday. ""Our partnership with Microsoft is yet another example of our commitment to empowering customers to increase productivity and drive performance with Workday -- all in an intuitive experience that mirrors how they prefer to work.""

""Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet, and key to this is forging strategic partnerships with companies including Workday,"" said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. ""Blending the power of Workday's cloud-based finance and HR applications with the cloud productivity of Office 365 will enable our customers to simplify their businesses processes, enhance collaboration, and infuse more intelligence into their organizations.""

New Integrations Empower Workday Customers to Increase Productivity and Drive Performance Solutions from Microsoft and Workday are designed to work the way people want to work. Because of that, customers already spend a significant part of their day working between Microsoft Office 365 and Workday applications. These new integrations will further streamline this work experience, enabling joint customers to:

Simplify collaboration and better adapt to continuous organizational changes: Connecting Office 365 Groups with Workday will enable joint customers to simplify collaboration and transform how work gets done across organizations, teams, and projects. Leveraging the Microsoft Graph API, this integration enables organizational changes within Workday to be automatically reflected in Office 365 Groups. For example, should an employee move to another team, the Office 365 Groups they belong to will automatically reflect this change across email, calendars, and shared documents, ensuring the right people are involved in collaboration at all times. This will ultimately facilitate and encourage even more productive working relationships, and improve the effectiveness of teams and reorganization efforts. Simplify day-to-day tasks to increase productivity: Enabled by Microsoft Flow and Workday's dynamic business process framework, joint customers will be able to eliminate mundane tasks and manual processes by automating workflow across any third-party applications in the Microsoft Flow ecosystem and Workday. For example, a manager can set up an automated workflow for a new employee in Workday, which adds the new hire to specific groups on third-party messaging and chat services. From there, an automated welcome message will introduce the new hire to the group. Maximize time and resources: Connecting Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) with the Microsoft Graph will provide people and teams with rich, actionable insights into the company's communication and collaboration trends. Using Microsoft MyAnalytics (formerly Delve Analytics), employees will be able to better understand how, when, and with whom they are spending their time as well as ways to make the most of it. For example, employees could determine the average time spent in meetings, response times to their emails, their most frequent collaboration partners or how many emails they have exchanged with their managers and peers.

Delivery of the Office 365 and Workday integrations will begin in the second quarter of 2017. The two companies plan to continually work together to deliver additional, deeper connections between their solutions in order to help companies around the world transform their businesses.

408,2016-09-23T07:01:00+00:00,"SPYRUS NcryptNshare(TM) Product Suite Merges FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Validated Hardware, Software, and Management System With Microsoft's Surface Pro for Premier Secure Mobility Solution","SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 23, 2016) -  SPYRUS, Inc., a global leader in certified hardware-based security and encryption solutions for enterprise and government markets, today announced the integration of the Rosetta® microSDHC™ PKI and TrustedFlash™, the NcryptNshare product line, and the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Surface Pro™ family of mobile computing platforms to encrypt, seal and share enterprise and personal data in enterprise and cloud-based systems. Possessing unprecedented cryptographic robustness and ease of use in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 environments, NcryptNshare was originally developed to protect classified government data. The Rosetta microSDHC and TrustedFlash secure storage devices in sizes up to 32 GB with 64GB by year end incorporated with an internal FIPS 140-2 Level 3 rated Rosetta Micro Hardware Security Module (HSM) provides a hardware Root of Trust coupled with AES-256 bit secure storage. This unprecedented combination of portability and security is a natural for globally distributed enterprises in defense, homeland security, electronic healthcare, Internet of Things control and critical infrastructure protection and control.

""The challenge facing many enterprise and government organizations is that current mobility software solutions do not adequately protect stored, shared, or transmitted data from being exfiltrated, corrupted by malware or compromised by sophisticated cyberattacks,"" said Tom Dickens, COO, SPYRUS. ""In fact, in cloud environments, critical security functions such as key management and revocation of user privileges are never actually in the hands of the data owner, effectively weakening reliance on trusting the true identity of the owner or the confidentiality of the data. Use of the SPYRUS NcryptNshare applications in conjunction with Microsoft mobility solutions delivers IT organizations a cost-effective way to securely manage critical data in a globally distributed environment, protecting sensitive data from present and future cyber threats while meeting regulatory compliance requirements across all verticals.""

The SPYRUS NcryptNshare suite of applications secured by the EAL5+ and FIPS 140-2 Level 3 tamper resistant SPYCOS hardware Root of Trust within the Rosetta microSDHC offers comprehensive security for end-to-end confidentiality, digital signature-based integrity and identity and secure collaboration among dynamically configurable Communities of Interest (COI). NcryptNshare applications supported in this family include RES4Office, RES Pro, and RES Disk with additional solutions for other operating environments in development. RES4Office is an Office 2010, 2013, 2016, and Office 365 desktop application add-on that enables easy to use, encrypt and share WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, VISIO, and PROJECT applications. The owner's digital identity and the confidentiality and integrity of all data stored in are now completely controlled by the data owner and not the enterprise or publicly available cloud service provider. This end-to-end encryption approach allows a customer and their collaboration partners to use one or more shared service providers such as SharePoint or Microsoft, Google, AWS, Box, or DropBox cloud services regardless of the cloud provider's underlying IT infrastructure.

NcryptNshare applications are the only secure file sharing solutions that apply advanced elliptic curve cryptography to provide key and data protection in hardware. SPYRUS patent pending encrypt, seal, and sharing security service can guarantee users are notified of malware alterations before files are decrypted hence preventing malware infiltration into the corporate network.

SPYRUS end-to-end encrypt, seal, and sharing solutions begin by creating and enforcing the root of trust in Rosetta HSM enabled devices such as SPYRUS bootable Windows To Go USB 3.0 live drives, P-3X Encrypting Drives, and Rosetta USB Smart Cards. Rosetta supports business policies for the generation and protection of digital identities, encryption, and signature keys in a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security container. With Rosetta devices, digital identities between data originators and external recipients can be verified and validated to enforce trust in an organization's defined set of communities. This is also true when used in machine-to-machine networks used for IoT communications.

413,2016-06-20T07:01:00+00:00,SPYRUS(R) Introduces SPYRUS Enterprise Management Service (SEMSaaS) to Securely Manage Microsoft Certified Windows To Go Live Drives and Encrypting Storage Drives,"SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 20, 2016) - SPYRUS today announced its new SEMS (SPYRUS Enterprise Management System) as a Service (SEMSaaS) managed cloud services to manage Windows To Go live drives and Encrypting Storage Drives used by enterprises to reduce costs and increase data at rest security. SPYRUS SEMSaaS operates on the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure Cloud Platform to provide enterprises with centrally controlled mobile device management combined with the economic and performance advantages of cloud-based computing services. SEMSaaS managed devices include certified Windows To Go live drives including WorkSafe™, WorkSafe Pro™, Secure Portable Workplace™, and Portable Workplace™, PocketVault P-3X and the groundbreaking encrypting Rosetta TrustedFlash™ microSDHC cards will be managed in 3rd Quarter 2016.

""All the unmatched enterprise-level management features of SEMS on premise device management system are now available on Microsoft Cloud,"" reported Tom Dickens, SPYRUS COO. ""Our customers requested SPYRUS assist them to decrease the demands on their IT departments by providing turnkey services from replication of enterprise Windows images to managing the MDM system for Windows To Go deployments. SPYRUS has responded with our SEMSaaS cloud services and, in advancing our industry leadership position, we have added proprietary 'Defense-in-Depth' layers of security to protect the enterprise data and network."" He added, ""Azure enables SPYRUS to use the inherent capability of the Microsoft Cloud to work with the customer and size and configure SaaS computing resources best tailored to their needs. Whether managing hundreds or thousands of SPYRUS encrypting and bootable live drives, customers who take advantage of SPYRUS SaaS cloud services will be able to quickly deploy and manage devices anywhere in the world through SEMS management and reliable cloud-based network connectivity.""

SEMSaaS extends global, national and organizational management and security services for mobile users previously provided by SEMS on premise. SEMS is designed with a three tier hierarchy of administration to provide the separation of roles demanded by enterprise IT organizations. The CISO Administrator has a view into all administrator activities at every level, the SEMS Administrator can create admin groups and selectively administered roles that oversee a department or geographic region to remotely disable and re-enable a device, remotely destroy encryption keys and data to ""kill"" the operability of the device, or to securely issue appropriate commands based on whether a device is misused, lost, or stolen. Audit facilities will capture related user actions which can then be monitored centrally to observe profiles of use and trigger notifications for unusual activities regardless of where the devices are located.

Equally important for deployment is the ability to change SEMSaaS policies for use of the endpoint device by groups or by individuals. SEMS hierarchical architecture facilitates national and organizational device policy definition, user audit and device control procedures to permit the deployment of help desk administrative consoles based on respective enterprise needs. SEMSaaS administrators can control registration and modify usage policies, e.g., off-line usage limits, expiration date, or recovering forgotten passwords through the SEMSaaS Azure network.

For maximum security and separation of data, each customer's SEMSaaS infrastructure is installed on a separate SPYRUS managed Azure platform. The full range of SEMS management services including command and control, audit, and administrative consoles are available via the SEMSaaS consoles at customer's facilities while leveraging the advantages of additional scalability, disaster recovery and reliability features provided by Microsoft Azure cloud configurations.

To mitigate against increasingly successful global attacks on HTTPS SSL/TLS protected connections, SEMSaaS uses a proprietary SPYRUS SECX protocol to add session-based digital signature and content encryption to augment the secure HTTPS tunnel between SPYRUS endpoint devices and the SEMSaaS Azure cloud services.

In addition, Azure itself meets a broad set of international as well as regional and industry specific compliance security standards and controls have been verified by various audits and analyses to achieve certifications and attestations. The SPYRUS SaaS cloud solution employs Azure SQL servers which have built-in backup and restore capabilities. With Microsoft Azure availability targeted at 99.95%, interruptions of service should be minimal. In the event the Azure infrastructure is temporarily unavailable, the SEMS client software on the Windows To Go bootable drives and encrypting storage drives will allow them to continue to function in an off-line mode.

SPYRUS SEMSaaS versions may also be installed and added to customer's existing data center service provider housing their own Microsoft IT infrastructure to achieve potential efficiencies of maintenance and support services by the customer's IT department. SEMSaaS itself is transparent to whether the system components are dedicated customer-based IT resources or operating on the Microsoft AZURE cloud infrastructure.

414,2016-06-15T16:12:00+00:00,Momentum for FIDO Authentication Leads Evolution Beyond Passwords,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 15, 2016) -  Now is the time for the world to stop relying on passwords. This is clear as 63 percent of all data breaches involve the use of stolen, weak, or default passwords, while the recent LinkedIn, Myspace, Tumblr and Fling password leaks left 642 million accounts compromised and millions scrambling to change the old, simple passwords that they reuse across applications. Technology and service providers agree, and are backing a new standard to solve the password problem: FIDO strong authentication.

The FIDO Alliance is the cross-industry consortia that provides a rich set of specifications and certifications for an emerging and interoperable ecosystem of hardware, mobile and biometrics-based devices. This ecosystem enables web service providers to deploy strong authentication solutions that reduce password dependencies and provide a superior, simpler and trusted user experience.

The Alliance today announced a number of proof points highlighting the global adoption of FIDO authentication over the past 18 months since the FIDO specifications were released, and a mere 12 months since the launch of the FIDO® Certified program:

The number of FIDO Certified products continues to expand.
 More than 200 products from global technology leaders are now FIDO Certified, the Alliance announced today, giving service providers a diverse and flexible range of turnkey options to deploy FIDO standards. This represents a 100-percent increase since the start of 2016.

Organizations with new FIDO Certified products announced today include: Austria Card; Aware, Inc.; Beijing SHENQI Technology Co. Ltd.; Century Longmai Technology Co., Ltd; Coolpad Group Limited; Goodix; GOTrust Technology Inc.; IDEX; Infineon Technologies; INITECH Co., Ltd.; Institute for Information Industry; KDDI CORPORATION; KONA I Co., Ltd; Koscom Corporation; KT; KYOCERA Corporation; Ledger; LeEco; Lenovo; LG Uplus; Lightfactor; Neoframe, Inc.; Open Security Research (OSR); Penta Security Systems Inc.; Safran Identity & Security; SGA Solutions Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Excelsecu Data Technology Co., Ltd; VASCO Data Security International; Yubico.

These latest certifications include the first FIDO Certified products that support Bluetooth® for wireless strong authentication. With these products, the Bluetooth authenticator needs only to be near a Bluetooth-enabled device for the user to be strongly authenticated to web apps on that device.

More details on the latest FIDO Certified products and updates to the program are the focus of a June 23rd FIDO Alliance webinar at 2 pm EDT. To register, visit https://fidoalliance.org/events/fido_certification_validating_next_generation_auth/.

FIDO authentication is increasingly available for online authentication.
 FIDO authentication is now enabled on devices from the top five global handset manufacturers. Additionally, service providers including Google, PayPal, Samsung, Bank of America, NTT DOCOMO, Dropbox, GitHub and GOV.UK Verify have made FIDO authentication available to protect hundreds of millions of end-users' desktop and mobile apps, while RSA and eBay are among the many companies that have launched FIDO Certified solutions to facilitate enterprise and commercial deployments.

Coming soon: Microsoft also will be integrating FIDO into Windows 10 for passwordless authentication, while the FIDO Alliance is working with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to standardize FIDO strong authentication across all web browsers and related web platform infrastructure.

Service providers are realizing the benefits from deploying FIDO. In a recently-published two-year study of its FIDO deployment with security keys, Google revealed that using FIDO strong authentication is markedly faster than other strong authentication methods, has zero authentication failures, reduces hardware and support costs over one-time password (OTP) tokens, and provides all of the necessary privacy and security protections from phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.

According to Google, ""our users have been very happy with the switch: we received many instances of unsolicited positive feedback.""

FIDO strong authentication is simpler than other options. FIDO authentication is much simpler than remembering all kinds of passwords or other forms of strong authentication. The user simply needs to look at something (iris scan, facial recognition), touch something (fingerprint sensor, security key, wearable), say something (voice recognition) to be securely authenticated to any online service that supports FIDO. For security, FIDO uses public key cryptography and is strongly resistant to phishing, while user credentials and biometric templates are never stored on servers and never leave the user's device.

""When we started tackling the password problem, we knew that our solution first and foremost would have to be based on proven security to stop the ongoing onslaught of data breaches,"" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. ""Second, users will have to actually want to use it. And third, it would have to be an open industry standard so it could become ubiquitously adopted by the whole internet ecosystem. This is what we have designed with FIDO, and as the adoption momentum demonstrates, we are well on the path towards that ubiquity.""

Learn more about the FIDO Alliance, FIDO standards and certification at www.fidoalliance.org.

About FIDO® Certified FIDO certification testing is based on industry-standard best practices to objectively evaluate technical implementations of the FIDO specifications. FIDO certification is open to all who want to offer FIDO authentication in products and services compliant with FIDO specifications. There are two options for FIDO certification testing: interoperability testing events or on-demand testing.

The next FIDO Certified interoperability testing events will take place on August 30, 2016 for FIDO U2F and August 31 and September 1, 2016 for FIDO UAF. Subsequent testing sessions will occur approximately every 90 days or as demand dictates. Detailed information about the program and testing registration may be found at the FIDO Alliance website.

On Demand Testing has been introduced as an alternative to attending interoperability events. On Demand Testing is available year-round, with three options: virtual; shipped; and in-person. For more details, visit the FIDO Alliance website.

About the FIDO Alliance The FIDO Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

The FIDO Alliance Board of Directors includes leading global organizations: Aetna, Inc. (NYSE: AET); Alibaba Holdings (NYSE: BABA); American Express (NYSE: AXP); ARM Holdings plc (LSE: ARM) (NASDAQ: ARMH); Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC); BC Card; CrucialTec (KRX: 114120); Daon; Egis; Google (NASDAQ: GOOG); Intel (NASDAQ: INTC); ING (NYSE: ING); Infineon Technologies AG (FSE: IFX) (OTCQX: IFNNY); Lenovo (NASDAQ: LNVGY); MasterCard (NYSE: MA); Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT); Nok Nok Labs, Inc.; NTT DOCOMO, INC.

416,2016-05-11T07:01:00+00:00,SPYRUS NcryptNshare(TM) Product Line Answers National Concerns for Increased Privacy and Integrity of Corporate and Personal Data,"SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - May 11, 2016) - SPYRUS, Inc., a global leader in certified hardware-based security and encryption solutions for enterprise and government markets, today announced its NcryptNshare product line to encrypt, seal, and share enterprise and personal data in enterprise and cloud-based systems. NcryptNshare integrates RES applications software with the Rosetta hardware security module present in all SPYRUS security devices to provide unprecedented cryptographic robustness and ease of use in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 environments. Now available for the commercial market, NcryptNshare was originally developed to protect government data against cyberattacks by using SPYRUS military-grade hardware-based file encryption for collaborative data-sharing and transport between secure enclaves.

The Rosetta Hardware ""Root of Trust"" securely enables NcryptNshare's end-to-end confidentiality, digital signature-based integrity, non-repudiation and identity to protect such enterprise use cases as financial and legal transactions, research data analytics, enterprise business data and intellectual property, and Personally Identifiable Information healthcare records. Internet of Things (IOT) use applications include millions of appliances requiring absolute device authentication, defense against cyberattacks to command and control data, and protection for sensitive content which is used in critical power grids, Machine-to-Machine (M2M), vehicle communications, and intelligent monitoring systems.

NcryptNshare applications being introduced for the Microsoft Office suite include RES4Office, RES Pro, and RES Disk with additional solutions for other operating environments in development. RES4Office is an Office 2010, 2013, 2016, and Office 365 desktop application toolbar add-on that enables easy to use, encrypt and share WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, VISIO, and PROJECT applications. The owner's digital identity and the confidentiality and integrity of all data stored in SharePoint or Microsoft, Google, AWS, Box, DropBox or other cloud services are now completely controlled by the data owner and not the cloud service provider. This end-to-end encryption approach allows a customer and their collaboration partners to use one or more cloud provider services regardless of the cloud provider's underlying IT infrastructure.

""The challenge facing many enterprise and government organizations is that current collaboration software solutions do not adequately protect digital identity keys of the data owner or the encryption keys created to secure sensitive data from being corrupted by malware or compromised by sophisticated cyberattacks,"" said Tom Dickens, COO, SPYRUS. ""In cloud environments, these critical keys are never actually in the hands of the data owner effectively weakening reliance on trusting the true identity of the owner or the confidentiality of the data. Use of the SPYRUS NcryptNshare application delivers IT organizations a cost-effective way to add defense in depth protection for personal and device digital identities, cryptographic keys, and sensitive data from cyber threats and meet regulatory compliance requirements for data encryption.""

The NcryptNshare suite of Windows applications will feature unsurpassed data protection and secure file-sharing using cloud collaboration solutions. NcryptNshare applications are the only file sharing solutions that apply advanced elliptic curve cryptography to provide key and data protection in hardware. SPYRUS patent pending encrypt, seal, and sharing security service can guarantee users are notified of malware alterations before files are decrypted hence preventing malware infiltration into the corporate network.

SPYRUS end-to-end encrypt, seal, and sharing solutions begin by creating and enforcing the root of trust in Rosetta-token enabled devices such as SPYRUS bootable Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) certified Windows To Go USB live drives, P-3X Encrypting Drives, and Rosetta USB Smart Cards. Rosetta supports business policies for the generation and protection of digital identities, encryption, and signature keys in a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security container. With Rosetta devices, digital identities between data originators and external recipients can be verified and validated to enforce trust in an organization's defined set of communities. This is also true when used in machine-to-machine networks used for IoT communications.

According to a recent report by the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), the worst year since 2005 for breaches was 2014 closely followed by 2015. Statistically in 2015, approximately 40% of these breaches came from the business sector, and the balance from the Health/Medical, Banking/Credit/Financial, and Government/Military. While financial gain remains the primary motive for stealing data, a shift to new motives includes nation-state theft of intellectual property and business information, radical terrorism, social justice and targeted embarrassment, all of which require that organizations must change how what data, created by and communicated among their employees and contractors, is to be kept private and protected. 2016 is expected to have more massive cybercriminal attacks by nations, terrorists and professional ""for-hire"" hackers. SPYRUS NcryptNshare military-grade hardware-enabled applications were designed and have been certified to provide the powerful defenses needed against these dangerous threats to your information assets.

419,2016-03-24T11:30:00+00:00,Mesosphere Raises $73.5 Million in Series C Funding,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 24, 2016) -  Mesosphere, creators of the world's first Datacenter Operating System (DCOS), today announced it has closed $73.5 million in a Series C funding round led by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) joining as a new strategic investor. The round brings Mesosphere's total funding to date to nearly $126 million and supports the company's accelerating growth as DCOS becomes the de facto standard for enterprises operating containers and distributed systems in production. Mesosphere also announced the version 1.0 release of Marathon, the container operations system for DCOS, and the new Mesosphere Velocity platform for improving developer agility via continuous integration and continuous deployment with the DCOS.

Also participating in this round are previous Mesosphere investors Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures, and Fuel Capital, as well as new investors A Capital and Triangle Peak Partners.

""We're experiencing an exciting new era in the enterprise datacenter, and Mesosphere is leading the charge,"" said Lak Ananth, Managing Director at Hewlett Packard Ventures. ""Mesosphere's DCOS is the most exciting new enterprise operating system since Linux, and Hewlett Packard Ventures is excited to partner with them to support their rapid growth.""

""Mesosphere is at the center of three of the biggest tech trends today -- cloud, containerization, and microservices,"" said Scott Guthrie, Executive Vice President of Microsoft's Cloud + Enterprise division. ""Mesosphere's DCOS is preferred by our enterprise customers given the maturity of the container orchestration solution, and that's why we chose it as a key component for bringing containers to our enterprise-grade Microsoft Azure cloud platform.""

Mesosphere makes it simple for enterprises to build, install, manage and scale today's must-have technologies, including Docker, Apache Cassandra, Jenkins, Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. Mesosphere's DCOS and the open source technologies that comprise it (including Apache Mesos and Marathon) are proven foundations for building microservices-based applications, running big data systems and operating massive production container environments. The new products announced today further Mesosphere's lead as the most production-proven platform for running modern applications.

Enterprises use the Mesosphere DCOS in production and at massive scale in some of the world's largest private datacenters, including at Verizon. Customers can take advantage of DCOS in public cloud environments, as well. It can run on cloud instances just like it does on bare metal, and is a key component of Microsoft's Azure Container Service.

Mesosphere DCOS is the first major operating system introduced since Android, and the first ever operating system purpose-built for datacenter-scale systems and applications. The open source core of DCOS, Apache Mesos, originally gained prominence as the key technology that killed the Fail Whale at Twitter, and was the platform on which Apache Spark was built at the University of California at Berkeley, AMPLab.

Mesosphere Velocity and Marathon v1.0 
 The open source Marathon 1.0 improves container operations through new features around networking and security, and kicks off an aggressive development roadmap over the next year that will bring about additional improvements in areas such as high availability, seamless upgrades and privacy. Marathon has a long list of production users, including Yelp, which uses it to launch more than 1 million containers a day for code testing.

Mesosphere Velocity complements Marathon by helping organizations accelerate application development lifecycle. Velocity makes it simple to deploy and manage scalable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments -- which today often involve code delivered via Docker containers. Velocity presently focuses on the industry standard Jenkins open source project and integrates with Marathon for a fully integrated container lifecycle. A large number of major companies, including eBay, already run massive CI/CD environments built on Mesos, Jenkins, Docker and other tools in order to speed up the process of pushing code live and making developers more agile. Velocity brings these same capabilities to every type of company.

""Software is eating the world and enterprises of all sizes are paying attention to a new class of applications that run at datacenter-scale,"" said Florian Leibert, CEO and Co-founder at Mesosphere. ""Whether you make toothbrushes or jet engines, you need an agile IT infrastructure that can run modern container applications and integrate analytics and big data technologies, but which can also support developers using continuous innovation cycles. DCOS is the first platform that takes the roadblocks out of the way so developers and operators can thrive in this new world of containers and distributed systems.""

About Mesosphere Mesosphere (Twitter: @Mesosphere), founded in 2013 by the co-creator of Apache Mesos and the architects of the Mesos infrastructures at Airbnb and Twitter, is building the new datacenter operating system (DCOS) to help enterprises unlock the next generation of scale, efficiency and automation. The Mesosphere DCOS pools datacenter and compute resources; gives IT operators a much simpler administration model; and improves developer velocity with more modern abstractions and APIs for writing, deploying and running distributed systems. Backed by A Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Fuel Capital, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Khosla Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Triangle Peak Partners and Microsoft, Mesosphere is headquartered in San Francisco with additional offices in New York and Hamburg, Germany.

420,2016-03-16T14:00:00+00:00,MadCap Software Launches Latest Version of Leading Technical Authoring Software for Modern Multi-Channel Publishing,"La Jolla, CA, March  16, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

MadCap Software, Inc., the leader in multi-channel content authoring and a showcase company for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Visual Studio, today announced that MadCap Flare 12 is now available. Flare, MadCap’s flagship software, is the industry’s most advanced single-source, multi-channel authoring and publishing solution, supporting the ability to publish to a number of devices and formats including print, Web, desktop and mobile.

MadCap Flare 12 expands MadCap’s commitment to enabling the delivery of modern online and print documentation in the languages of users’ choice. MadCap Software already offers the only professional authoring and publishing solution that allows customers to take advantage of creating and publishing a responsive HTML5 output with top navigation, which more closely resembles a modern, search engine-optimized, and completely customizable informational website.

MadCap Software continues its industry-leading innovation by building on these capabilities in version 12. The new release now includes a Custom Responsive Layout Editor that puts the power of creating responsive content and output in authors’ hands, without requiring in-depth knowledge of cascading style sheets (CSS) or requiring the assistance of Web development expertise. Additionally, Flare 12 offers new multilingual output functionality, enabling a project to be published in multiple languages—all within the same Web or print output. Complementing these features are several new and enhanced capabilities for empowering content authors with greater efficiency and control.

“Users want to access the information they need across the multiple devices they rely on, accelerating the move of multi-channel, responsive publishing into the mainstream,” said Anthony Olivier, MadCap founder and CEO. “With MadCap Flare 12, we continue to drive the next generation of online technical content delivery by empowering authors with fast, easy responsive design via our new editor. At the same time, multilingual Web and print output support for our global customers in Flare 12 advances our industry-leading approach to publishing content in multiple languages and viewable in formats of users’ choice—from print to the Web, mobile devices, and desktops to embedded in software.”

Olivier added, “In version 12, we have placed a great emphasis on enhancing the authoring experience with Flare. While a great deal of product development always focuses on end users, the publishing capabilities and integrations, this latest release of Flare has added a lot of features and functionality the author is going to love.”

Communications Professionals Highlight Flare 12 Benefits

“MadCap Flare 12 is an impressive offering with a renewed dedication to the power of single-sourcing and a focus on the importance of the authoring environment,” said Denise Kadilak, Blackbaud Inc. information architect. “The additional condition options and style sheet management settings offer users a new level of granularity for controlling outputs, and the improvements to the style sheet editor in conjunction with the addition of the Responsive Layout pane invites users of all skill levels to investigate the endless possibilities awaiting them in the CSS.”

“The new features and enhancements to existing features extend Flare to new levels of customizability while making it easier for authors to generate bleeding-edge outputs,” said Neil Perlin, owner, Hyper/Word Services. “Flare 12 represents a new benchmark for authoring tool power.”

“Another MadCap Flare release that delights! Flare 12’s many enhancements are going to make my work processes easier and my projects simultaneously more powerful yet simplified,” said Nita Beck, consultant, Nita Beck Communications. “I’m looking forward to the new responsive layout editor, snippet conditions and snippet variables, hyperlinks and cross-references to more destinations than ever, sortable tables, variables in more places than ever, side-by-side editing of style sheet mediums, style conditions, improved Word output, and more.”

Custom Responsive Layout Editor

The all new Custom Responsive Layout Editor in version 12 builds on MadCap Flare’s capabilities for creating responsive “frameless” HTML5 output with top navigation that more closely resembles a modern website. Using it, authors can place elements in a Web page and tell the CSS where to display images and how content should respond when viewed on different devices. The Custom Responsive Layout Editor provides robust functionality for controlling responsive layouts for Web, tablet and mobile displays. At the same time, the easy-to-use software requires no coding, and enables content authors to complete responsive designs within minutes, not hours. As a result, authors are empowered to take online output design into their own hands rather than relying on Web developers.

New Multilingual Capabilities

New multilingual output functionality in MadCap Flare 12 enables global companies to more easily deliver content to customers in their language of choice by letting authors publish the same project in multiple languages—all from the same print and Web output. Users can choose the order in which languages will appear in the PDF output, for example: English first, French second, Spanish third. Additionally, the multilingual output feature complies with grammar rules for different languages, so for instance, Arabic will read from right to left while English will read from left to right. For the Web-based output, users of the documentation will be able to select the language of their choice using a language drop-down in the upper right portion of the webpage.

In addition to multilingual output, MadCap Flare 12 now provides the appropriate smart quotes for each language. Notably, MadCap Flare can import translated content from MadCap Lingo and any other third-party computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool.

Features For Enhanced Usability, Efficiency and Control

MadCap Flare 12 offers several new features and enhancements for enriching usability and enabling greater authoring efficiency and control. The user interface has been significantly updated to focus on the six targets recommended for modern content: responsive HTML5, Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word, Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA), and EPUB e-book file format. A completely redesigned Style Sheet Editor offers multiple side-by-side medium views (Web, tablet and mobile), more complex selectors, and support for media queries, among other features. Version 12 also delivers a range of snippet enhancements, including the ability to pin snippets, set up snippet groups, apply snippet conditions to individual snippets, and set up snippet variables.

Additional features in MadCap Flare 12 include:

The ability to preserve tracked changes in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF output. Support for 64-bit computing to enhance performance. Improved support for high dots-per-inch (DPI) monitors and tablets to leverage advancements in display technology. The ability to insert page breaks independent of HTML elements. Advanced table sorting to provide tables that resemble those in applications, such as Microsoft Excel. Enhancements to the glossary, index sorting, source control, XML Editor, drop-down text, expanding text, and master page functionality in MadCap Flare.

MadCap Flare With MadPak Suite for a Seamless Experience

MadCap Flare 12 is accompanied by new releases of MadCap Contributor and MadCap Analyzer, which are part of the fully integrated MadPak Professional Suite.

422,2016-03-07T22:00:00+00:00,NTT DOCOMO Rolls Out FIDO Biometric Authentication to iOS Customers,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 7, 2016) -  The FIDO® Alliance, the cross-industry creators of open standards for simpler, stronger authentication, announced today that Japan's largest mobile network operator NTT DOCOMO, INC. (""DOCOMO"") has extended its market-leading deployment of FIDO® Certified strong authentication to its millions of customers with Touch ID®-equipped Apple iPhones and other iOS1 devices. DOCOMO adds this new FIDO-for-iOS capability to an already impressive suite of 10 FIDO Certified Android devices from Samsung, Fujitsu, Sharp, and Sony Mobile, ensuring that their customers enjoy unprecedented choice between platforms, devices and biometric authentication modalities including fingerprint touch, fingerprint swipe, and iris recognition.

DOCOMO's decision to add support for FIDO strong authentication to the base capabilities of Touch ID underscores both the security benefits and the rapid market adoption of FIDO standards in just over a year since the specifications were published. Today more than 100 solutions have been FIDO Certified and, in addition to DOCOMO, hundreds of millions of end-users' web and mobile apps have been FIDO-enabled for strong authentication protection by leading service providers, including Google, PayPal, Samsung, Bank of America, Dropbox, and GitHub.

""The expansion of cross-platform support from NTT DOCOMO highlights the growing global consensus that using open standards from FIDO Alliance is the right strategy for moving the connected economy off its dependency on passwords,"" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. ""As more service providers look to reduce fraud risk and give customers a better, faster user experience, I believe they will be following DOCOMO's example and deploying cross-platform FIDO-enabled, privacy-respecting biometric authentication that is simultaneously more secure and convenient.""

More details on DOCOMO's FIDO-for-iOS deployment Using FIDO specifications, DOCOMO is enabling its customers to securely authenticate themselves with Touch ID instead of a password to the DOCOMO d ACCOUNT™ app, which will be available in the App Store on March 9. From there, they will have secure access to DOCOMO account details, billing and services, including mobile gaming and music platforms d game™ and d music™, and shopping sites such as d delivery™ and d shopping™. DOCOMO is also removing the password from carrier billing, allowing customers to approve their payments via Touch ID.

In a media update about this news, DOCOMO said, ""The app will encourage more DOCOMO partner companies to incorporate the FIDO standard as users demand biometric authentication for an increasingly diverse range of mobile handsets.""

About The FIDO Alliance The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

423,2016-02-15T08:01:00+00:00,SPYRUS Announces Windows To Go Xtreme (WTGXtreme) as Latest Member of the Microsoft Certified Windows To Go Product Line,"SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 15, 2016) -  SPYRUS, Inc. today announced the SPYRUS Windows To Go Xtreme (WTGXtreme) drives bringing a new dimension to the world of Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows To Go operations. WTGXtreme drives build on the features of the award winning SPYRUS Windows To Go family certified by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), incorporating the most advanced encryption and security features with the greatest versatility in size and memory capacities that include a range starting at 32 GB to the newly announced 1 TB configuration only available from SPYRUS. WTGXtreme takes an evolutionary leap forward by allowing multiple processing environments with their own independent operational profiles on the same drive. Strong cryptographic separation ensures a high assurance environment to prevent data leakage between the domains and profiles.

""With the launch of the family of WTGXtreme products, SPYRUS brings its extensive repertoire of PKI based authentication technologies, cryptographic separation, and secure boot and storage to the ever growing Windows To Go ecosystem enabling secure BYOD support for enterprise information assurance policy,"" said Tom Dickens, SPYRUS COO. ""Use cases for SPYRUS WTGXteme with multiple processing environments allow organizations to support Windows 10 migration plans with multiple users sharing a single device, for example, 24X7 help desks, with their own unique access to their individual Windows profile. Or, for the most secure separation environments, users could potentially use a specific profile for multi-domain type of access to different levels of data classification.

Two different models of SPYRUS WTGXtreme drives are available. The Secure Portable Workplace Xtreme (SPWXtreme) and the WorkSafe Pro Xtreme (WSPXtreme) each combine Secured by SPYRUS™ security technologies, including XTS AES-256 encryption, with a USB 3.0 drive certified for Windows To Go (WTG). All of the WTGXtreme drives can be provisioned with multiple, independent profiles, each with its own Windows 8.1 and/or 10 operating system and independently encrypted with its own unique set of media encryption keys to protect data at rest. This provides an organization with options of supporting multiple Windows processing environments for up to four independent network domains, users or administrators while maintaining a strong cryptographic firewall separation between each environment to provide protection against data leakage. The SPYRUS Toughboot® boot loader decrypts the WTGXtreme drive and allows it to boot the appropriate Windows profile the user has selected, when that specific profile password or user certificate is entered and verified. After booting the WTGXtreme drive, it can be used like any Windows computer; and you still have access to the enhanced security features available with all the SPYRUS secure WTG drives. The drive's SSD class storage controller provides a secure execution environment that is significantly higher in performance than most rotating hard drives and comparable to the fastest SSD devices.

The WorkSafe Pro Xtreme version (WSPXtreme) drive also includes PKI smart card support on its FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated EAL 5+ Rosetta® Micro crypto hardware. The embedded Rosetta Micro can be used with digital certificates and shared between multiple domains or multiple users whether or not the WSPXtreme is booted. The onboard Rosetta Micro module contains the SPYRUS Cryptographic Operating System (SPYCOS®) employing elliptic curve cryptography algorithms including ECC key lengths to P-521; which provides highly secure authentication and storage as a hardware root of trust.

WTG Xtreme also supports the unique multiparty collaboration features of the new NcryptNshare applications for end-to-end encryption, user and origin validation and sharing between senders and recipients to protect data in transit and at rest. NcryptNshare in conjunction with the WSPXtreme can also support cloud based collaboration services that can be hosted in a commercial service provided data center, in a private, public or hybrid cloud or in hosted on-premise deployments.

SPYRUS devices enable immediate, economical, low-friction deployment of highly secure, high-capacity Windows 10 computing environments -- fully provisioned and fully functional within hours vs. weeks for traditional approaches. Organizations gain new agility to provision (and decommission) contractors, remote workers and telecommuters with a complete operating environment that includes global end-point support securely and centrally managed by the SPYRUS Enterprise Management System (SEMS™). The SPYRUS products have all successfully passed a battery of stringent MILSPEC 810 and related environmental and security requirements.

""Technical leadership, hardware security, onboard FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware security module with PKI capabilities, ultra-high performance, and the new features of Windows 10 make SPYRUS 1 TB drives the choice for high-capacity Windows To Go platforms,"" said Tom Dickens, SPYRUS COO. ""Our customers have told us that by deploying these new high-capacity drives, they will realize expanded use cases to use Windows To Go for video capture and surveillance systems and other large memory capacity computing projects. Other use cases include Disaster Recovery and Continuity of Operations scenarios, entertainment industry content development and distribution, and government agencies with high data volume requirements.""

With the addition of the 1 TB drive for Windows 10, SPYRUS's family of high-capacity live drives provide contractors, remote workers, travelers, and telecommuters with a complete operating environment that includes extensive storage capacity for development tools and large datasets that creates cryptographically secure ""personal cloud-like"" data centers in their hands . The new high capacity drives retain all the capabilities of their widely acclaimed smaller capacity versions and feature superior security defense of the operating system, documents, and identity credentials from tampering, cyber and malware attacks, or physical theft. SPYRUS WTG devices cover a range of layered hardware and software encryption configurations depending on the particular model.

The family of new 1 TB high-capacity Windows 10 drives maintains compatibility with the optional SEMS device management system. With SEMS device management, enterprise administrators can centrally register, block/unblock, revoke, set policies, audit, and ""kill"" SPYRUS Windows To Go drives wherever they are located. This is of particular value for an enterprise mobile user computing environment, in which SPYRUS offers the additional managed protection for networks and applications through SPYRUS WorkSafe and WorkSafe Pro Windows To Go drives with integrated PKI smart cards for two-factor authentication to access corporate communications and computing assets. Availability is planned for second quarter 2016.

About #GivingTuesday:

Now in its fourth year, #GivingTuesday is a global day of giving fueled by the power of social media and collaboration. Observed on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving (in the U.S.) and the widely recognized shopping events Black Friday and Cyber Monday, #GivingTuesday kicks off the charitable season, when many focus on their holiday and end-of-year giving. Created in 2012 by 92nd Street Y—a cultural center in New York City that, since 1874, has been bringing people together around the values of service and giving back—#GivingTuesday connects diverse groups of individuals, communities and organizations around the world for one common purpose: to celebrate and encourage giving. A team of influencers and founding partners joined forces—collaborating across sectors, offering expertise and working tirelessly—to launch #GivingTuesday, and it has become a movement that celebrates and supports giving and philanthropy with events throughout the year and a growing catalog of resources. To learn more about #GivingTuesday participants and activities or to join the celebration of giving, please visit: Website: www.givingtuesday.org; Facebook: www.facebook.com/GivingTuesday; Twitter: twitter.com/GivingTues.

434,2015-11-20T02:00:00+00:00,FIDO Authentication Poised for Continued Growth as Alliance Submits FIDO 2.0 Web API to W3C,"TOKYO, JAPAN and MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 19, 2015) -   The FIDO® (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance (https://www.fidoalliance.org/), an industry consortium launched in 2013 to revolutionize online security with open standards for simpler, stronger authentication, today announced at a FIDO seminar in Tokyo that tens of millions of FIDO-based devices are now in use to protect end-user and enterprise accounts with strong, cryptographic-based authentication at major relying parties such as Google, PayPal, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Bank of America, Dropbox, and GitHub.

With 72 FIDO Certified products, nearly 250 Alliance member organizations from around the world including US, UK, and German government agencies, and more than a dozen trade association partners, the market is clearly saying now is the time to deploy FIDO authentication to modernize outdated password systems.

To carry this momentum into 2016, the FIDO Alliance today submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international standards organization for the World Wide Web, a set of three technical specifications required to define a standard Web-based API designed to increase FIDO's existing desktop, Chrome, Android and iOS reach to support other platforms.

This FIDO-built Web API is intended to ensure standards-based strong authentication across all Web browsers and related Web platform infrastructure.

""FIDO specifications define a unified mechanism to use cryptographic credentials for unphishable authentication on the Web. The specifications enable a wide variety of user experiences and modalities,"" said Sampath Srinivas, vice president of FIDO Alliance. ""We are very excited about today's announcement and what it means for the future of ubiquitous unphishable FIDO authentication on the Web.""

W3C will now have change control of this API, with ongoing collaboration from FIDO Alliance member companies and other web ecosystem stakeholders. W3C is proposing a new Web Authentication Working Group to its membership. The FIDO Alliance will support the adoption of this W3C published Web API through the established FIDO Certification Program.

""The mission of the FIDO Alliance has always been stronger, simpler authentication: stronger to help protect data, and simpler to address the problems users face trying to create and remember multiple usernames and passwords. In order to achieve this mission, FIDO authentication needs to be available everywhere…on all the devices you use and with all of the apps & services you use,"" said FIDO Alliance president Dustin Ingalls. ""With FIDO support in the browser and in the platform, it will be easier than ever for apps and services to take full advantage of FIDO authentication helping to free the world from passwords. Today's announcement showcases how the work we've been doing in FIDO 2.0, and the submissions we are making to W3C will help us meet our goal of enabling FIDO authentication everywhere.""

FIDO's Web APIs highlight the Alliance's mission to submit mature technical specifications to recognized standards development organizations (SDOs) for formal standardization. The FIDO Alliance's W3C submission is the first time the Alliance has chosen to submit their specifications to an external SDO.

""Standardizing strong authentication in the Web Platform will help us to improve user and application security by moving beyond passwords. We thank FIDO Alliance members for bringing their work to W3C,"" said Wendy Seltzer, W3C Technology and Society Domain Lead.

The submission to W3C also supports the Alliance's goal to produce technical specifications that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce the reliance on passwords to authenticate users, and to operate industry programs to help ensure successful worldwide adoption of the FIDO specifications.

""What we submitted to the W3C are the Web API components; the rest of the FIDO 2.0 work remains within the FIDO Alliance and is still in development,"" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. ""The FIDO Alliance's strategy has always hinged on the idea that every device you purchase will come with FIDO standards support built-in, just as we see today with standards like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The FIDO 2.0 work is very well aligned to that strategy, and we encourage OEMs to begin planning their device support for these capabilities.""

FIDO's momentum highlights a 2015 that can be described as the year of major deployments at Internet scale. This adoption speaks to the growing acceptance of standards-based FIDO protocols by an Internet-user base motivated to extinguish the reliance on passwords that have been at the heart of ongoing mega breaches.

The evolution of FIDO Alliance protocols will further enhance the continuing roll-out and acceptance of FIDO-backed strong authentication and will bring additional platforms and authentication form factors to the market. Those that have already adopted FIDO-based public key cryptography are quickly realizing the benefits.

""It's been a pleasure to work with, and within, the FIDO Alliance to create a world that is no longer dependent on passwords,"" said Koichi Moriyama, Senior Director of Product Innovation, Product Department, NTT DOCOMO, INC., and FIDO Alliance board member. ""FIDO standards have been working extremely well for DOCOMO branded devices and services since our commercial launch in May. We are very excited about the prospect of providing more FIDO-enabled devices and services to our customers through the extended reach of FIDO 2.0 and W3C. We will definitely continue to work with FIDO Alliance to realize the vision of delivering a superior end-user experience by eliminating passwords with FIDO authentication's enhanced security features.""

Among the 72 products now available to the marketplace are the first FIDO Certified™ iOS products from Egis, Nok Nok Labs, and Samsung SDS, along with a line-up of smartphones from the world's leading OEMs. With a rich array of client and server options for Android, iOS, web and applications, consumers, Relying Parties and Service Providers have many choices to adopt FIDO authentication now.

FIDO members, and others, leverage open FIDO standards for Android, Apple, iOS and Touch ID to use FIDO authentication in devices, services and applications instead of passwords. The top 10 smartphone OEMs are represented in the FIDO Alliance or among FIDO Certified products in an emerging, powerful ecosystem that makes it easy to move away from username and password authentication to universal, interoperable FIDO authentication. Newly certified FIDO 1.0 products include FIDO applications, authenticators and servers from DDS, Goodix, Feitian, Hypersecu, LG Electronics, Neowave, Nok Nok Labs, Samsung, Samsung SDS, and Sony.

""The FIDO ecosystem is emerging with an abundance of options that enable easy adoption of strong authentication for Internet providers and services, enterprise and consumers,"" said Dustin Ingalls, president of the FIDO Alliance. ""In less than three years, the FIDO Alliance has delivered standards and a range of products that make it possible now to see a world that doesn't rely on passwords, but rather is prepared with more secure, private, and convenient FIDO authentication.""

""We are excited to pass the first FIDO Certification Process for iOS 9,"" said Steve Ro, Chairman and CEO of Egis. ""iOS plays a major part in mobile payment trends. With Egis Touch ID enabled UAF client, mobile payment service providers can extend its online payment services on iOS to a high level of usage and security. We will be able to provide more security, easy solutions, and products for authentication based on FIDO specifications. These specifications are changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that reduce reliance on passwords.""

""Nok Nok Labs is proud to have achieved FIDO certification for the Nok Nok App SDK for iOS, which is a key part of the Nok Nok S3 Authentication Suite,"" said Ramesh Kesanupalli, founder of Nok Nok Labs and FIDO visionary. ""The Nok Nok App SDK for iOS leverages the Secure Enclave and TouchID for both on-device and out of band authentication, allowing deploying organizations to deliver strong authentication across multiple platforms including iOS. As operating systems such as Apple's iOS evolve and improve, the FIDO specifications underpinning the Nok Nok S3 Suite deliver a cross-platform framework allowing organizations to leverage those advances for any authenticator, any device and any application.""

""The FIDO solution from Samsung SDS offers compelling and trusted opportunities with FIDO Certified products for both Android and iOS. On top of the interoperability of FIDO, SDS adds high security to its product through CC (Common Criteria) certification, presenting a wide scope of FIDO solution,"" Dongho Kim, product manager, Samsung SDS.

""The new Keydo Flash Drives by NEOWAVE just passed FIDO U2F certification. This new product line combines FIDO U2F USB Security Key and USB 3.0 mass storage (from 8GB to 64GB) with 256-bit AES data encryption. With the free portable Chromium browser option on the flash partition, it is the world's first all-in-one portable and 'zero footprint' secure cloud browsing solution compatible with FIDO U2F,"" said Bruno BERNARD, CEO of NEOWAVE.

Certification testing is based on industry-standard best practices to objectively evaluate technical implementations of the FIDO 1.0 specifications, which are Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) and Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). Demand for FIDO certification is high, as indicated by the many products certified just since FIDO certification testing launched in May. Both FIDO Alliance member and non-member organizations participated in this third round of FIDO certification tests conducted in September.

The growing ecosystem of FIDO products and services enables companies, organizations and individuals to move beyond using passwords for security by adding FIDO U2F second-factor devices and/or eliminating passwords entirely through FIDO UAF biometric solutions such as fingerprint or iris recognition sensors. If biometric data is used by a FIDO authenticator, the biometric information never leaves the device. FIDO authentication to the cloud is always performed by means of industry standard public key cryptography.

The next FIDO Certified interoperability testing events are scheduled for FIDO U2F on December 8th, and for FIDO UAF on December 9th and 10th. Subsequent testing sessions will occur approximately every 90 days or as demand dictates. Detailed information about the program and testing registration may be found at the FIDO Alliance site.

443,2015-08-31T07:00:00+00:00,SPYRUS Achieves Windows 10 Certification for Industry-Leading Half-Terabyte USB 3.0 SSD Bootable Windows To Go Devices,"SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 31, 2015) -  SPYRUS® today announced the world's first 512 GB high-capacity Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Windows® 10 certified Windows To Go SSD live drives. The Portable Workplace™, Secure Portable Workplace™, WorkSafe™, and WorkSafe Pro™ devices extend the SPYRUS family of 32, 64, 128, and 256 GB versions to address a rapidly developing need for large memory capacity to address local data analytics processing and on-demand data mining among a mobile workforce. The value of this data requires a solution that transforms almost any laptop or desktop into a trustworthy workspace to protect this valued content and the resultant critical business information.

SPYRUS devices enable immediate, economical, low-friction deployment of highly secure, high-capacity Windows 10 computing environments -- fully provisioned and fully functional within hours vs. weeks for traditional approaches. Organizations gain new agility to provision (and decommission) contractors, remote workers and telecommuters with a complete operating environment that includes global end-point support securely and centrally managed by the SPYRUS Enterprise Management System. The SPYRUS products have all successfully passed a battery of stringent MILSPEC 810 and related environmental and security requirements.

""Technical leadership, hardware security, onboard FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware security module with PKI capabilities, ultra-high performance, and the new features of Windows 10 make SPYRUS 512 GB drives the choice for high-capacity Windows To Go platforms,"" said Tom Dickens, SPYRUS COO. ""Our customers have told us that by deploying these new high-capacity drives, they will realize significant cost savings by repurposing employee/contractor-owned or corporate legacy computers to large memory capacity computing projects. Other use cases include Disaster Recovery and Continuity of Operations scenarios, entertainment industry content development and distribution, and government agencies with high data volume requirements.""

With Windows 10 certification, SPYRUS's family of high-capacity live drives provide contractors, remote workers, travelers, and telecommuters with a complete operating environment that includes extensive storage capacity for development tools and large datasets that creates cryptographically secure ""personal cloud-like"" data centers in their hands. The new high capacity drives retain all the capabilities of their widely acclaimed smaller capacity versions and feature superior security defense of the operating system, documents, and identity credentials from tampering, cyber and malware attacks, or physical theft. SPYRUS WTG devices cover a range of layered hardware and software encryption configurations depending on the particular model.

The family of new 512 GB high-capacity Windows 10 drives maintains compatibility with the optional SPYRUS Enterprise Management System (SEMS™). With SEMS device management, enterprise administrators can centrally register, block/unblock, revoke, set policies, audit, and ""kill"" SPYRUS Windows To Go drives wherever they are located. This is of particular value for an enterprise mobile user computing environment, in which SPYRUS offers the additional managed protection for networks and applications through SPYRUS WorkSafe and WorkSafe Pro Windows To Go drives with integrated PKI smart cards for two-factor authentication to access corporate communications and computing assets.

445,2015-08-12T15:00:00+00:00,FIDO Alliance Announces 62 Authentication Products Are Now FIDO(R) Certified,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 12, 2015) -  The FIDO® (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance (https://www.fidoalliance.org/), an industry consortium launched in 2013 to revolutionize online security with open standards for simpler, stronger authentication, today announced there are 62 FIDO Certified™ products after the most recent round of FIDO Alliance testing of products for compliance to the FIDO 1.0 specifications.

Newly certified FIDO 1.0 products include FIDO authenticators and servers from Egis, Feitian, GoTrust, MicroStrategy™, Sensory, SK Planet, and Synaptics. FIDO Certification testing is available to anyone building implementations of the FIDO 1.0 specifications -- FIDO Alliance members and non-members alike. Certification testing is based on industry-standard best practices to objectively evaluate technical implementations of the FIDO 1.0 specifications, which are Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) and Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). Both FIDO Alliance member and non-member organizations participated in this second round of FIDO certification testings conducted in July.

""We are very pleased to see the diverse range of new FIDO Certified products from the most recent round of compliance testing. FIDO 1.0 specifications are designed to be flexible and future-proof, accommodating a variety of modalities and transport bindings,"" said Brett McDowell, FIDO Alliance executive director. ""The innovative products coming through our FIDO certification program come in a variety of forms to accommodate the many diverse organizations ready to deploy simpler, stronger FIDO authentication.""

""We're proud to contribute to the FIDO Alliance mission of driving towards password-free convenience and high security,"" said Ritu Favre, senior vice president, general manager, Biometrics Product Division, Synaptics. ""FIDO Certification accelerates adoption of Synaptics' Match-in-Sensor architecture by ensuring interoperability among the growing ecosystem of FIDO compliant products and online services.""

New implementations accompany the many new FIDO products that are available now. Among these, SK Planet will deploy newly certified FIDO products in Syrup Pay, a one-click payment service that accommodates PC and smartphone users throughout Korea.

The growing ecosystem of FIDO products and services enables companies, organizations and individuals to move beyond using passwords for security by adding FIDO U2F second-factor devices and/or eliminating passwords entirely through FIDO UAF biometric solutions such as fingerprint or iris recognition sensors. If biometric data is used by a FIDO authenticator, the biometric information never leaves the device. FIDO authentication to the cloud is always performed by means of industry standard public key cryptography.

The next FIDO Certified interoperability testing events are scheduled for FIDO UAF on September 22 and for FIDO U2F on October 5. Subsequent testing sessions will occur approximately every 90 days or as demand dictates. Interested parties should contact the FIDO Alliance at https://fidoalliance.org/certification/ for more information and to register products for FIDO Certified testing.

About The FIDO Alliance The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

446,2015-08-03T13:00:00+00:00,Aryaka's Growth Accelerates at Record Speed in H1 2015,"MILPITAS, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 3, 2015) -  Aryaka®, the leading WAN as-a-Service company, announced today that the company closed the first half of 2015 with a series of significant wins. Aryaka closed the first-half of calendar 2015 with record bookings, record revenues, record gross margins, and a record number of new customer acquisitions. In the first half of calendar 2015, Aryaka's total number of active customers, as well as long-term recurring revenues, nearly doubled as compared to the first-half of calendar 2014.

From Inventing SD-WANs to Building out a Global, Private Network

Today's agile global businesses couldn't move forward to capitalize on trends like globalization and the mainstreaming of cloud computing because MPLS and WAN optimization hardware acted as major bottlenecks.

As a result, Aryaka decided that just replacing MPLS with an SD-WAN was not nearly enough. So, the company began steadily building out an optimized, global private enterprise-grade WAN, one that can be deployed in a day and is an order of magnitude more affordable. And Aryaka offered it as a 24x7 managed service, eliminating the sleepless nights that customers have when they try to cobble together WAN optimization boxes and MPLS lines. Now, optimization and software-defined networking are simply features within Aryaka's complete WAN solution.

To further extend that network, Aryaka expanded its footprint of global Points of Presence (PoPs) in January 2015, adding PoPs in Los Angeles, Miami, and Dubai. As a result, more than 90% of the world's business users are now within 30 milliseconds of an Aryaka PoP.

""In the past six months, we saw the enterprise market express a great deal of interest in software-defined networking, particularly SD-WANs,"" said Ram Gupta, Executive Chairman of Aryaka. ""Businesses have grown weary of the compromises that come from having to choose between expensive, inflexible private networking options, such as MPLS, and the unreliable and congested public Internet, which SD-WAN vendors rely on. We help enterprises put all of those compromises in the rear-view mirror with our no-compromise WAN as-a-Service portfolio, which offers flexible, on-demand services that include everything from SD-WANs to guaranteed performance to WAN optimization, all of which can be deployed in less than a day and with no Capex whatsoever.""

Here are some other highlights from a busy and successful first half of 2015:

Aryaka Continues to Attract Customers Fed up with MPLS, but also Skeptical of SD-WANs

Those new customers include:

Marposs, a world leader in precision equipment for measurement and control in the production environment, deployed Aryaka's cloud-based WAN as-a-Service to enable improved network connectivity and application performance between its plants in Italy and China.

Henny Penny, a global leader in food service equipment solutions and the inventor of the first commercial pressure fryer, selected Aryaka's WAN as-a-Service to improve collaboration between its global offices.

INTTRA, the world's largest ocean shipping electronic marketplace, deployed Aryaka's cloud-based WAN as-a-Service to enhance network connectivity and application performance between its sites in the U.S., Singapore, India, and China.

Other notable customers include Nordic Semiconductor; Populous, the world's leading sports and entertainment architecture and design practice; Avepoint, which was in Inc. magazine's 2014 ""Inc. 500|5000"" list of the fastest-growing companies in America; and Nortek (NASDAQ: NTK).

Aryaka Secures New Funding

In the spring, Aryaka secured $16 million in additional funding, bringing the total raised to date to $75 million. Nexus Venture Partners led the Series C-3 round and was joined by existing investors Trinity Ventures, InterWest Partners, Mohr Davidow Ventures, and Presidio Ventures.

New Executive Chairman, Senior VP of Global Sales, CFO, and CEO Join Aryaka

In the first half of this year, Aryaka invested in its next stage of growth by appointing a number of new senior executives with experience scaling companies. These appointments include:

Mr. Hilbert has led sales teams and driven revenue growth at a number of technology companies, including IBM, EMC, Rackspace, and most recently, FireHost.

Kelly Hicks joined Aryaka's leadership team as Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining Aryaka, Mr. Hicks was Head of Corporate Finance at Atlona, Inc., where he led finance and operational functions to deliver record revenues and profit for the company. Mr. Hicks has held previous CFO roles at private and public high-technology companies and possesses fundraising, M&A, and IPO experience.

Prior to joining Aryaka, he was the President and CEO of Saba Software, where he guided Saba from its legacy as a pioneer in Learning Management Software to becoming a key player in the broader Talent Management Suite market. Prior to Saba, he served as COO at Coremetrics (an IBM Company), VP of Platform Engineering and Operations and GM of Voice Applications at WebEx Communications, Inc. (now a part of Cisco), and Regional VP at Oracle.

Strategic Partnerships Expand Channel, Magnify Influence in NA, APAC, EMEA, and Africa

The first half of 2015 featured a number of new partnerships. These strategic partnerships dramatically expand Aryaka's channel, while also amplifying the company's presence in key global regions, including EMEA and APAC. These partnerships include:

447,2015-07-28T15:00:00+00:00,FIDO Authentication Gains Momentum in US and European Financial Services,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 28, 2015) -  The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance (https://www.fidoalliance.org/), an industry consortium launched in 2013 to revolutionize online security with open standards for simpler, stronger authentication, today announced new leadership from the Financial Services industry will contribute valuable experience and insight to the global initiative poised to supplant the world's reliance on passwords. Today, leading banks in Europe and the U.S., ING Bank and USAA, join Bank of America, Discover, MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa as financial institutions on a diverse 25-member board of directors that is shaping global standards for strong authentication.

Dustin Ingalls, president of the FIDO Alliance said, ""As one of seven founding members, PayPal has made it clear from the outset that passwords have proven themselves to be a significant problem for the Financial Services sector and their customers. Today, we welcome two leading financial institutions, ING and USAA, commending their and by extension the financial sector's growing influence in the FIDO Alliance. Together, we can make a security difference for companies around the world.""

Though FIDO standards are designed to meet the authentication requirements of every segment and use case, Financial Services may have the most urgent need as their clients demand privacy, security and convenience in all transactions. Pent-up demand in mobile payments markets accelerated the world's first deployment of FIDO authentication when PayPal, Samsung, Synaptics, and Nok Nok Labs collaborated to meet the need. FIDO board members Alibaba and Nok Nok Labs partnered soon after to deliver FIDO authentication for securing mobile payments for 600 million Alipay users. Since then, membership in the FIDO Alliance has grown beyond 200 companies and government agencies, including several financial institutions, such as Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan Chase.

ING Bank of the Netherlands is a global financial institution with a strong European customer base. Its 53,000 employees offer retail and commercial banking services to customers in over 40 countries. ING is currently the number one 'diversified financials' company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. As their commitment to FIDO authentication illustrates, ING Bank is focused on empowering people and organizations to stay a step ahead in life and in business.

""In today's digital world, our customers expect to do their banking the way they want, when they want and in a consistent, reliable, clear and easy way. ING's strategy is built on providing our customers access anytime, anywhere in a clear and easy way. Yet, security is paramount and cannot be compromised,"" said Rob Bening, Chief Information Security Officer, ING Bank. ""We support FIDO authentication and its advancement globally, because it's an open, scalable and interoperable framework that can support the current and future authentication needs of our customers and the industry.""

USAA is a family of companies that provide insurance, banking, investments, retirement products and advice to 10.9 million current and former members of the U.S. military and their families. As a leading enterprise in multifactor authentication and committed to developing innovative solutions for its members, USAA supports the global FIDO standards because they enable advanced security and consumer choice.

""USAA offers world-class capabilities that take advantage of an ever-maturing digital marketplace,"" said Rick Swenson, AVP Enterprise Security Group - Operations Support. ""We wholeheartedly support secure, innovative measures to ensure our members' security through any channel of their choice.""

""I couldn't be more pleased by how leading financial institutions from around the world have embraced and supported the FIDO Alliance this early into our mission to deliver open standards for simpler, stronger authentication,"" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. ""I look forward to collaborating strategically with USAA and ING Bank as we move beyond standards development to fostering global deployment of FIDO authentication.""

449,2015-07-14T13:00:00+00:00,Aryaka Provides JAS Forwarding Worldwide With a Fast Lane to Microsoft Azure Through ExpressRoute Partnership,"MILIPITAS, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 14, 2015) -  Aryaka® announced today that JAS Forwarding Worldwide is using Aryaka's WAN as-a-Service to ensure fast, reliable access to Microsoft Azure, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) public cloud platform. As part of Microsoft's EspressRoute program, Aryaka provides Microsoft customers with fast, reliable access to Microsoft Azure and, soon, to Office365, as well.

Like many companies migrating mission-critical applications to the cloud, JAS Forwarding Worldwide, a recognized leader in global freight forwarding and logistics, learned that application performance tends to degrade over the Internet. JAS Forwarding had already begun moving key workloads to Microsoft Azure, including Active Directory domain servers, file services, and ERP applications. However, due to congestion, latency, jitter, and other networking issues, the public Internet simply can't deliver the speed and reliability that enterprises demand from their cloud-based applications.

JAS had also investigated traditional methods, such as MPLS, for accelerating its connections to Azure, but they were too expensive and took far too long to deploy. JAS Forwarding then looked at Microsoft's ExpressRoute program.

ExpressRoute gives enterprises the ability to create private connections between Azure datacenters and IT infrastructure located on-premises or in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet and offer greater reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

""Microsoft is committed to helping customers embrace and benefit from a cloud-first world. Aryaka's WAN as-a-Service solution will enable our customers to move to the cloud more easily by providing a more secure and reliable way to take advantage of the flexibility and scale of cloud solutions. We look forward to working together to help companies accelerate their connections to Microsoft Azure, and, soon, to Office365,"" said Yousef Khalidi, Distinguished Engineer, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft.

JAS Forwarding had already been using Aryaka's WAN as-a-Service to accelerate access for its 240 worldwide offices to a centralized, mission-critical ERP application, and JAS has been thrilled with the Aryaka service. Then, not long after JAS Forwarding dismissed MPLS, Aryaka joined Microsoft's ExpressRoute program.

""Once Aryaka became part of ExpressRoute, our decision was an easy one,"" said Mark Baker, CIO of JAS Forwarding Worldwide. ""With Aryaka, we were able to deploy a fast lane to the Azure cloud in two weeks. Actually, Aryaka turned up the connection in a few hours, but we had to coordinate with the other vendors and SaaS providers we rely on, but even with those third parties factored in, Aryaka's deployment time was amazingly fast.""

""We're excited to have the opportunity to work with Microsoft to help JAS Forwarding Worldwide accelerate its cloud roadmap,"" said Ashwath Nagaraj, CTO of Aryaka. ""Business leaders are hoping to gain increased agility and higher ROI through their cloud migrations, but knowledge workers are used to LAN-like speeds. Anything less erodes productivity.""

Other reasons Baker cited for choosing Aryaka included the security provided over its global core network, the ability to get backup-and-recovery running reliably in the Azure Cloud, end-to-end network and application performance visibility through the MyAryaka™ portal, and Aryaka's unique multi-segment architecture, which enables companies to conserve expensive enterprise bandwidth.
